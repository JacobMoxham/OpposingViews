According to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, it\u2019s the latter and by a very wide margin. From p. 4 of GAO\u2019s report:\n\nBut as researchers at the Georgia State recently reported, media coverage of terrorist incidents makes it seem as if terrorism is almost exclusively perpetrated by Muslims:\n\nWe examined news coverage from LexisNexis Academic and CNN.com for all terrorist attacks in the United States between 2011 and 2015. Controlling for target type, fatalities, and being arrested, attacks by Muslim perpetrators received, on average, 449% more coverage than other attacks. Given the disproportionate quantity of news coverage for these attacks, it is no wonder that people are afraid of the Muslim terrorist. More representative media coverage could help to bring public perception of terrorism in line with reality.\n\nThat incident-media reporting disconnect is matched by another: the notion that Arab/Muslim-Americans are more susceptible to radicalization, and thus to becoming terrorists, and that there are a discreet set of reliable indicators that will tell authorities who is or is not more likely to become a terrorist.\n\nThe same month the Georgia State researchers released their terrorism-media bias findings, the Brennan Center released a report on the state of the debate and federal \u201ccountering violent extremism\u201d (CVE) programs. Citing dozens of empirical studies and recognized experts in the fields of criminology, psychology, and intelligence, the report states \u201cExtreme or radical views are often assumed to lie at the heart of terrorism. But evidence shows that the overwhelming majority of people who hold radical beliefs do not engage in, nor support, violence.\u201d\n\nWith respect to the alleged role of Salafist ideology in motivating domestic acts of terror, the Brennan Center study quotes the FBI\u2019s own assessment on the topic:\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the degree to which Islamist materials and ideologues \u2014 such as Anwar al-Aulaqi (US Person), Abdullah e-Faisal, and Feiz Muhammed, all of whom appeal to English-speaking audiences \u2014 played a part in the radicalization of the persons included in this assessment. \u2026 While Internet personalities are often cited as a source of radicalization, factors outside the scope of this assessment \u2014 such as social environment and personal psychology (how a person processes both external and internal messaging) \u2014 were also influential. As for claims that there are a combination of indicators that, if detected early enough, can tell family, friends, or local authorities who may be on the path to terrorism, the Brennan Center report uses the research and conclusions of former CIA officer Marc Sageman to rebut the notion. \u201c\u2026we still do not know what leads people to engage in political violence. Attempts to discern a terrorist \u2018profile\u2019 or to model terrorist behavior have failed to yield lasting insights.\u201d That hasn\u2019t stopped the FBI, via it\u2019s now-infamous \u201cDon\u2019t Be A Puppet\u201d website, from continuing to peddle the debunked \u201cterrorist profile\u201d concept. And as the Brennan Center report lays out, the FBI is only one of a number of federal, state, or local entities using discredited \u201cterrorist profile\u201d models.\n\nUnfortunately, the Senate and House members who originally requested that GAO look at federal CVE programs\u2013including Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) and ranking member Claire McCaskill (D-MO), along with House Homeland Security Committee ranking member Bennie Thompson (D-MS)\u2013did not ask GAO to evaluate the theories and assumptions underlying federal CVE programs. Accordingly, the audit offers recommendations for tinkering with programs that discriminatorily and disproportionately target the Arab/Muslim-American community on the basis of long-since debunked notions about who and why someone becomes a terrorist.\n\nHouse and Senate members need to base federal counterterrorism policies on facts\u2013such as the role U.S. foreign policy in the Arab and Muslim world plays in fueling terrorism. Members of Congress who want to win the war of \u201chearts and minds\u201d vis a vis ISIS need to remember that our greatest weapon is a strict adherence to constitutional norms of free association and speech, and that targeting fellow citizens of Arab descent or the Muslim faith for evidence-free surveillance and political repression only validates the ISIS narrative that America is at war with the Muslim and Arab world."}, "https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/12/why-isnt-this-a-major-national-scandal/": {"title": "Why Isn\u2019t This A Major National Scandal? | Current Affairs", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/12/why-isnt-this-a-major-national-scandal/", "text": "Two months ago, investigative journalists Amy Julia Harris and Shoshana Walter published a story through the Center for Investigative Journalism\u2019s Reveal entitled \u201cThey thought they were going to rehab. They ended up in chicken plants.\u201d It was covered by a few outlets, including Reason, the Chicago Tribune, and the Arkansas Times. I haven\u2019t heard much about it since, though it made a Bloomberg list of good reading material (which is where I found it).\n\nI\u2019m a somewhat cynical person. I understand that the world is full of horrible suffering, that nobody can pay attention to all of it, and that sometimes the natural reaction to hearing about some new depressing thing is to say \u201cYep, well, what do you expect?\u201d But even though I have a certain amount of weary numbness to news stories about the criminal justice system\u2014which, after all, just murdered an acquaintance of mine\u2014there are still stories that stick out as especially egregious and disturbing. The Reveal investigation is one of them. It exposes a particular kind of brutal forced labor that I had no idea existed. And, assuming Harris and Walter\u2019s reporting is sound, the story merits far more attention than it has received.\n\nLet me just summarize what Reveal\u2018s report shows: in rural Oklahoma, a program called Christian Alcoholics & Addicts in Recovery (CAAIR) supposedly operates as a diversionary treatment program for drug offenders, that judges can sentence defendants to as an alternative to prison. In reality, CAAIR operates a labor camp, in which residents work long hours in slaughterhouses for large food companies. There is no real \u201ctreatment\u201d to speak of, and CAAIR pockets the workers\u2019 wages. Sometimes those sent there haven\u2019t even committed drug offenses; it appears to exist simply to provide convict labor for large corporations.\n\nThe Reveal investigation shows that CAAIR embodies the worst trends in the exploitative prison labor system. It is uncertified and unregulated, fraudulently promising rehabilitation, but then sending people into factory farms, where they spend long days \u201cpulling guts and stray feathers from slaughtered chickens destined for major fast food restaurants and grocery stores\u201d including Popeyes and Wal Mart. Those who have been in it describe it as a \u201cslave camp.\u201d\n\nBut even worse, the work done by those sent to CAAIR is physically dangerous. The most disturbing parts of Harris and Walter\u2019s reporting expose how workers would be mangled or maimed in slaughterhouse machinery, and the program would pocket their worker\u2019s compensation money and threaten them with prison rather than treating them:\n\nMen in the CAAIR program said their hands became gnarled after days spent hanging thousands of chickens from metal shackles. One man said he was burned with acid while hosing down a trailer. Others were maimed by machines or contracted serious bacterial infections. Those who were hurt and could no longer work often were kicked out of CAAIR and sent to prison, court records show. Most men worked through the pain, fearing the same fate. \u201cThey work you to death. They work you every single day,\u201d said Nate Turner, who graduated from CAAIR in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s a work camp. They know people are desperate to get out of jail, and they\u2019ll do whatever they can do to stay out of prison.\u201d\u2026\n\nHarris and Walter tell the story of Brad McGahey, whose hand was crushed by industrial machinery while working in the program, which told him that the time he spent working during his recovery would not be counted toward his sentence:\n\nOn May 27, 2010, three months into his time at CAAIR, something went wrong. A machine dumped a mountain of parts onto the conveyor belt, causing chicken to pile up faster than he and his co-worker could sort it. As they plunged their hands into the heap of cold parts, McGahey remembers hearing a scream. His co-worker\u2019s rubber glove was caught in the conveyor belt.\n\nMcGahey grabbed the woman\u2019s arm, wresting her hand free. But the machine snagged his own hand. In a matter of seconds, McGahey\u2019s wrist was jerked backward, lodged in the seams of the conveyor belt as it hurtled toward a narrow stainless steel chute overhead. Someone yanked the emergency kill cord, which should have stopped the machine, McGahey recalled. But it raced upward, dragging him along with it. He felt a flash of panic. Then an excruciating crunch. Medical notes later would say McGahey suffered a \u201csevere crush injury.\u201d The machine smashed his hand, breaking several bones and nearly severing a tendon in his wrist. When he finally yanked his wrist free, his hand was bent completely backward. The pain was so bad that he nearly fainted. A nurse at the plant took one look at him and called CAAIR. \u201cThe kid\u2019s hand is mangled!\u201d he recalled the nurse screaming into the phone. \u201cHe needs help!\u201d McGahey expected an ambulance. Instead, one of CAAIR\u2019s top managers picked him up at the plant and drove him to the local hospital. Doctors took X-rays of McGahey\u2019s hand, gave him a splint and ordered him not to work. Back at CAAIR, he spent a sleepless night cradling his throbbing hand. He figured it would take months to heal and planned to rest. But CAAIR\u2019s administrators would have none of it. They called McGahey lazy and accused him of hurting himself on purpose to avoid working, former employees said. CAAIR told him that he had to go back to work \u2013 either at Simmons or around the campus until his hand healed, which wouldn\u2019t count toward his one-year sentence. Wilkerson said she doesn\u2019t remember the specifics of McGahey\u2019s case but acknowledged that CAAIR has given such ultimatums before.\n\n\u201cYou can either work or you can go to prison,\u201d McGahey remembered administrators telling him. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\nOf course, insofar as the story of CAAIR is about the court system providing what amounts to slave labor for the private sector, it is not unique. Across the country, prisoners don\u2019t just hammer out license plates. They do everything from staffing call centers to picking cotton. Programs vary widely, with some paying decently and seeming closer to meaningful rehabilitation than others. But given the infamously pitiful inmate pay scale (which can be as low as 16 cents an hour), even the conservative National Review has suggested that \u201cprison labor walks and quacks like slavery.\u201d\n\nCAAIR is on the extreme end of this, though, and the details of Reveal\u2018s investigation should be shocking, even to the jaded. Here we have a fully dystopian criminal justice system: people convicted of nonviolent crimes are sent to become indentured servants for corporations, where their bodies are destroyed as they work in stifling, rancid slaughterhouses, with no compensation and little medical care. And this, of course, is considered the \u201cmerciful\u201d alternative to prison.\n\nIt is not, then, that CAAIR is necessarily representative of the system as a whole. Harris and Walter seem to have uncovered outright fraud by the program, and theoretically some of what it does isn\u2019t legal. But the fact that such a program can exist anywhere, brutalizing people without the country paying attention, is alarming. And this does seem to be the kind of criminal justice system we will get if we ever do decide to let the \u201cfree market\u201d offer rehabilitative solutions for those convicted of crimes. CAAIR is a cautionary tale about what private-sector punishment might look like. (See also the way black prison laborers in the South were outsourced to do dangerous work for private interests. Though, of course, the fact that a prison is run by the state rather than a corporation is no guarantee it won\u2019t be a slave plantation.)\n\nThere are a few important observations we can make here, both about criminal justice itself and about media. First, we can see one of the paradoxes of diversion and rehabilitation programs: around the country, drug courts that divert people into treatment rather than sending them to prison have become extremely popular. That\u2019s a good thing: judges should be considering alternatives to prison, and using incarceration only as an absolute last resort. But every alternative requires accountability, because it\u2019s easy to see how \u201crehabilitation\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d can become buzzwords, and how the opportunity for cheap labor might lead unscrupulous providers to take advantage of the push for alternatives to prison. One of the most frustrating aspects of the criminal justice system, that hinders efforts at understanding and reforming it, is just how opaque it is. It\u2019s nearly impossible to get inside facilities to understand what\u2019s actually going on. Prisons themselves are frequently located in remote areas and there are endless bureaucratic obstacles to getting information. I once interned at the ACLU\u2019s National Prison Project, which conducts class action lawsuits over prison conditions, and one of the most serious challenges we faced was trying to actually understand what was really happening in the facilities. It took years, sometimes decades, of endless motions and court orders in order to get the places investigated. That\u2019s made even harder in places like the infamous Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in Mississippi, which was rife with violence and sexual abuse but operated completely out of the public eye.\n\nCAAIR also usefully illustrates how selective, even arbitrary, national news coverage can be. It\u2019s mysterious to me why certain stories catch fire and everybody pays attention to them, while others don\u2019t. Certainly, I understand that entertaining things are easier to get people to read than depressing things and that there is a fairly obvious hierarchy of victims, with deaths that are (1) sensational and (2) involve Europeans or Americans attracting far more attention than other deaths. But it also sometimes seems to simply be a matter of luck: X news report happened to be picked up by X outlet which caused X commentator to see it, and everything went from there. I was kind of stunned to realize that I was the only writer I could find who was paying attention when Robert Pruett was about to be executed. I only knew about Pruett because I happened to click on his website a few years back, and it\u2019s because I knew about him that Pruett\u2019s name got into the New York Times. That really unsettled me: the fact that national coverage was given to Pruett only because I happened to randomly stumble across a website suggested to me that journalism isn\u2019t nearly as \u201csystematic\u201d as we might naturally assume. So much depends on what individual reporters choose to do: if it weren\u2019t for Harris and Walter\u2019s work, I wouldn\u2019t know about CAAIR.\n\nThat seems obvious. It is. But it\u2019s important to appreciate the implication: individual acts of journalism matter. Whether reporters have resources matters. The news doesn\u2019t report itself, it gets made by people, and who those people are, how much time they have, and what choices they make shape what we end up learning, and what our picture of the world looks like. Current Affairs has devoted plenty of space to thrashing the New York Times for its various failings, and each of those thrashings has been richly deserved. But while I\u2019d prefer a world in which the Times wasn\u2019t infuriating, I\u2019d definitely prefer an infuriating Times to no Times at all. Outlets like Current Affairs, without the money for in-depth investigative work, depend heavily on the work of on-the-ground reporters to provide sources for our work. I can write a good article analyzing the various evils of Joe Arpaio, but I can\u2019t do it unless there are local Arizona papers doing the hard work of actually uncovering those evils to begin with.\n\nAnd still, so many things pass us by, or are chatted about for a day and then we all kind of forget about them. Or they are part of the parade of \u201cOh Dear\u201d stories, the ones that give us something to mutter \u201cOh Dear\u201d about each morning. And even when something does get a lot of attention, it\u2019s frequently impossible to actually translate that attention into actual changes. Back when I was in college, I became appalled by the existence of a place called the Judge Rotenberg Center, a special needs school in Massachusetts that \u201ctreats\u201d autistic children by giving them painful electric shocks until their behavior improves. There is no place else in the country that uses this method. Experts are appalled by it. And yet the Judge Rotenberg Center has existed for decades, in the bluest of blue states. Every few years there is a scandal or an investigation and the place gets some media attention. But after spending time working in an activist group trying to get the center shut down, it became clear to me that \u201cawareness\u201d wasn\u2019t really the issue. We\u2019d pressure officials and collect signatures, and submit letters to the editor. (Actually I just rediscovered an old op-ed I wrote about the place in my school newspaper.) But there was a disconnect between the process of drawing attention and the process of actually forcing political change. I think that\u2019s all too common in the age where protest consists of holding signs (or using hashtags): it\u2019s not just that we don\u2019t \u201cdo the hard work\u201d that turns outrage into results, it\u2019s that it\u2019s difficult to know what the strategy for achieving those results actually looks like.\n\nSo if you ask me how to keep the CAAIR story from becoming just another one of the daily examples of how American criminal justice fails, I\u2019m not sure I know the answer. But getting people to pay attention is still the first step. Reveal\u2019s report is an extraordinary piece of investigative journalism, and their findings should be a national scandal.\n\nIf you appreciate our work, please consider making a donation or purchasing a subscription.

Sunde says that we\u2019ve taken power from those who should have it \u2014 the users \u2014 and given it to companies who now dictate our digital destiny. And the kicker? Sunde thinks there\u2019s no way to fix it.\n\n\u201cEverything has gone wrong,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s not about what will happen in the future it\u2019s about what\u2019s going on right now. We\u2019ve centralized all of our data to a guy called Mark Zuckerberg, who\u2019s basically the biggest dictator in the world as he wasn\u2019t elected by anyone. Trump is basically in control over this data that Zuckerberg has, so I think we\u2019re already there. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way for us to stop it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see his point, either. I\u2019ve been reflecting a lot recently on how rare piracy is these days. I recall, as a teen, everyone I knew had a complex media server set-up, loaded up with rips of all their favorite movies. Now? The best I see people use are jank-tastic streaming sites. And even then, most just Netflix or Hulu or Amazon or give up on watching the movie they wanted. While these services thrive, torrent sites are tougher to find than ever. PirateBay itself is often spotty. And most of the major sites have been taken down.\n\nIt\u2019s good for a lot of people that piracy has petered off a bit, but it\u2019s also indicative of how many of the fights on the internet have gone. Corporations largely won out against copyright activists. The laws surrounding movie or music or game distribution hasn\u2019t changed. Copyrights can still be held and exercised in bizarre and abusive ways as we see on YouTube practically all the time. Instead, companies just used money and data to quash the problem.\n\n\u201cThe Internet was made to be decentralized,\u201d Sunde says. \u201cBut we keep centralizing everything on top of the internet\u2026 We\u2019re super happy about self-driving cars, but who owns the self-driving cars? Who owns the information about where they can and can\u2019t go? I don\u2019t want to ride in a self-driving car that can\u2019t drive me to a certain place because someone has bought or sold an illegal copy of something there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easier and easier to feel like we\u2019re living in the worst cyberpunk dystopia. Or, at least, worse as far as we\u2019re concerned. Cold War tensions rage on, hackers are constantly in the news, and nothing any of us ever do will be private again. It\u2019s okay, though, because have fun gadgets and we can easily communicate and connect with people all over the world\u2026 right? Probably not.\n\nAs we keep seeing, our data isn\u2019t safe. Even with those who don\u2019t have any nefarious intent. Hacks leak our private information all the time. I can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019ve had to mess with passwords or change out credit cards this year because of hacks. That might seem like it\u2019s evidence of the continued power of smaller groups \u2014 and it is, to a point \u2014 but it\u2019s also proof positive that Sunde\u2019s onto something. Corporations provide juicy targets because they carry so much data. They are targeted because they are centralized.\n\nSunde claims the only option is to force governments to regulate companies and their data ethics practices more strictly. He doesn\u2019t pretend it\u2019s a perfect solution. Just a means of making an awful situation tolerable.\n\n\u201cWe, as the people, kind of lost the internet back to the capitalist society\u2026 We had this small opening of a decentralized internet, but we lost it by being naive. These companies try to sound good to take over, that they\u2019re actually \u2018giving\u2019 you something. Like Spotify gives you music and has great passion for music, and all of the successful PR around it\u2026 Big data and Big Tobacco are similar in that sense. Before, we didn\u2019t realize how dangerous tobacco actually was, but now we know it gives you cancer. We didn\u2019t know that big data could be a thing, but now we know it is.

The agency still says it is committed to transparency on the updated website, but the transparency is now described as being for the benefit of \u201cthose who authorize and oversee NSA\u2019s work on behalf of the American people.\u201d The definition of \u201cintegrity\u201d has been edited, too. The agency formerly said its commitment to integrity meant it would \u201cbehave honorably and apply good judgment.\u201d The phrase \u201cbehave honorably\u201d has now been dropped in favor of \u201ccommunicating honestly and directly, acting ethically and fairly and carrying out our mission efficiently and effectively.\u201d\n\nThe new list of values includes the additions \u201crespect for people\u201d and \u201caccountability.\u201d But the section on respecting people is a reference to diversity within the NSA workforce, not a general commitment to members of the public. Accountability is defined as taking \u201cresponsibility for our decisions.\u201d The one core value that remains essentially unchanged is \u201crespect for the law,\u201d which the agency says means it is \u201cgrounded in our adherence to the U.S. Constitution and compliance with the U.S. laws, regulations and policies that govern our activities.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from The Intercept on Tuesday, the NSA played down the alterations. Thomas Groves, a spokesperson for the agency, said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than a website update, that\u2019s all it is.\u201d"}, "http://www.theonion.com/article/ceo-worked-way-son-ceo-53652": {"title": "CEO Worked Way Up From Son Of CEO", "keywords": ["Local", " business", " human interest", " News With Video", " Vol 52 Issue 34", " Local"], "url": "http://www.theonion.com/article/ceo-worked-way-son-ceo-53652", "text": "NEW YORK\u2014Though today he holds a powerful position as head of a leading information technology firm, MergeMedia CEO Gary Lightman told reporters Thursday he, amazingly, worked his way to the very top of the company from humble beginnings as the son of the previous CEO. \u201cA lot of people are surprised when I tell them I started out as a lowly senior vice president right out of college, but it\u2019s true,\u201d said Lightman, 37, who stressed that he had to work every angle to get to where he is today, including being born to the head of the company, being raised by the head of the company, going to the same prestigious business school as the head of company on a legacy scholarship, and being hired at age 22 for a management-level position by the head of the company. \u201cBelieve me, I had to sit through a lot of board meetings to get where I am today.

The Metropolitan Police Department opted to \u201ckettle\u201d everyone on the streets nearby the initial anarchist-driven property destruction, something it does not, by reputation, make a habit of doing during protests.\n\nThe mass round-up swept the \u201cAntifa\u201d rowdy types together with many peaceful protesters, journalists, and volunteer legal observers who turn out in bright green hats to help uphold First Amendment rights at such events in the capital. After hours of kettling, police arrested more than 200 people. All were initially charged with felonies by the United States Attorney\u2019s office, which continues to pursue the vast majority of those cases.\n\nThis is how the public has understood what happened in the District on Inauguration Day for the past five months. But that story undersells the full scope of the MPD\u2019s violent conduct that day, the D.C. chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday against the city, police department, police chief, and numerous yet-unnamed officers.\n\nThe \u201cguilt by association\u201d round-up and mass arrests, the liberal use of pepper spray, and the kettling itself would all be constitutionally dubious enough on their own, the ACLU-D.C.\u2019s Scott Michelman said Wednesday.\n\nBut the experiences of the lawsuit\u2019s four plaintiffs \u2014 independent photojournalist Shay Horse, volunteer legal observer Judah Ariel, and peaceful protesters Elizabeth Lagesse and Milo Gonzalez \u2014 suggest that MPD sought physical and emotional retribution on the hundreds of people kettled, the ACLU alleges.\n\nAn officer ordered Horse, fellow plaintiff Milo Gonzalez, and three others to take their pants off before grabbing their testicles and then inserting a finger into their anuses while \u201cother officers laughed,\u201d the complaint alleges. Horse is a photojournalist, one of six reporters initially arrested and charged whose cases have been dismissed.\n\n\u201cI felt like they were using molestation and rape as punishment. They used those tactics to inflict pain and misery on people who are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty,\u201d Horse said. \u201cIt felt like they were trying to break me and the others \u2014 break us so that even if the charges didn\u2019t stick, that night would be our punishment.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to the lawsuit on Wednesday, the MPD defended its reputation and maintained that all its arrests were proper.\n\n\u201cEach year, the men and women of MPD protect the rights and ensure the safety of thousands of First Amendment assemblies, demonstrations and protests,\u201d the department said. While thousands demonstrated peaceably on Inauguration Day, the statement went on, \u201cthere was another group of individuals who chose to engage in criminal acts, destroying property and hurling projectiles, injuring at least six officers. These individuals were ultimately arrested for their criminal actions.\u201d\n\nThe department also pledged that \u201call\u2026allegations of misconduct will be fully investigated.\u201d Michelman said the ACLU welcomes that promise but doesn\u2019t exactly trust it.\n\n\u201cWe have significant concerns that that won\u2019t be sufficient, in light of repeat problems MPD has had with arresting law-abiding demonstrators and responding\u2026with excessive force,\u201d Michelman said.\n\nThe discovery phase of the new suit should allow the plaintiffs to identify the names, ranks, and badge numbers of the specific officers they accuse of abusing them physically and psychologically. But it\u2019s also important to the plaintiffs that such individualized accountability not shunt responsibility away from supervisors and top brass. \u201cThe events of the day show a high degree of coordination, suggesting the problems run deeper than the misconduct of a handful of officers,\u201d said Michelman.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. declined to comment on how the lawsuit, in which it is not named as a defendant, might alter the course of the 202 ongoing felony prosecutions it is pursuing related to Inauguration Day events. A spokesman cited the office\u2019s policy of never commenting on ongoing felony cases.\n\nBaltimore resident and fellow plaintiff Elizabeth Lagesse still faces felony charges stemming from her arrest that day. She detailed how she and other peaceful marchers were suddenly herded into the kettle along with some of the Antifa glass-smashers, kept there for hours, then eventually cuffed with zip-ties so tightly that they cut her wrist and numbed her hands.\n\nLagesse, who had come down from Baltimore to protest, said she was then dropped into a holding cell with 20 other women and denied food and water through the night.\n\n\u201cI came to D.C. to do a good thing: To express my concern about the direction of our country,\u201d Lagesse said. \u201cYou would think that of all the cities in the world, Washington, D.C., would respect my freedom of speech and right to peaceably assemble.\u201d\n\nEven before the full depth of the alleged depravity of MPD officers\u2019 actions toward protester detainees was laid out in Wednesday\u2019s suit, the rough crowd control methods employed on Inauguration Day had alarmed protest law observers. ACLU and National Lawyers Guild representatives told ThinkProgress at the time that the department\u2019s actions break from a long pattern of sensible, calm response to protests \u2014 even ones that radically disrupt roads, businesses, and private organization headquarters in the capital.\n\nBy dint of geography, MPD responds to far more mass demonstrations than any other police department. Marchers without permits regularly take over streets, sit in at organizational buildings, and even chain themselves to physical structures in protest without prompting the sort of crackdown that followed the Antifa provocations on Inauguration Day.\n\nBut MPD\u2019s reputation for high standards on protester civil liberties coexists with a less-prominent and darker track record in cases like this one, Michelman said.\n\n\u201cWhen there are groups of people who protest only peacefully, demonstrations that go off without a hitch, MPD does tend to handle those pretty well. They tend to be prepared and respectful, and we commend them for that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is when there\u2019s a little bit of lawbreaking at a mostly peaceful demonstration, the response from MPD is massive, it\u2019s excessive, it\u2019s unjustified, and it\u2019s unconstitutional. That\u2019s what we saw on January 20.\u201d\n\nThe indiscriminate targeting of reporters, legal observers, and peaceful protesters along with those who had broken windows and assaulted officers is not a one-off, he said. MPD reacted similarly to a World Bank protest in 2002 that went sideways. The city later paid $8.25 million to settle civil rights cases brought by nearly 400 protesters. That case, known among local lawyers as Pershing Park, was not the first multi-million-dollar payout by the District over an episode that broke from MPD\u2019s broader pattern of high-road protest management.\n\nFor Judah Ariel, a plaintiff who was on hand that day as a legal observer and described officers firing pepper cannons at the crowd he was in \u201clike Al Pacino in Scarface,\u201d the experience felt like a betrayal from the place he\u2019s chosen to make his home.\n\n\u201cThis is the city where I\u2019ve chosen to make my home and raise a family. And all of the sudden it felt like my police department, my government, had turned on me without warning and without justification,\u201d Ariel said.\n\n\u201cWherever we live, the issues facing our country are too important and the stakes are too high. All of us must feel free to protest and speak out against the government without fear of retribution.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to correct the spelling of Elizabeth Lagesse\u2019s name and clarify that Scott Michelman works for the ACLU\u2019s D.C. affiliate."}, "http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/19/video-surfaces-of-milo-yiannopoulos-defending-pedophilia-acu-board-reportedly-not-consulted-on-cpac-invite/": {"title": "Video surfaces of Milo Yiannopoulos defending pedophilia, ACU board reportedly not consulted on CPAC invite", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/19/video-surfaces-of-milo-yiannopoulos-defending-pedophilia-acu-board-reportedly-not-consulted-on-cpac-invite/", "text": "The American Conservative Union, which hosts the annual gathering of conservatives called \u201cCPAC,\u201d announced over the weekend that alt-Right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos would be this year\u2019s keynote speaker.\n\nMany criticized the move because Yiannopoulos is not seen as a traditional conservative \u2014 if a conservative at all. Instead, Yiannopoulos is seen as the figurehead of the alt-Right movement, a movement that prides itself in nationalism, which many accuse of racism and anti-Semitism.\n\nJonah Goldberg, a senior editor for the conservative magazine National Review who is seen as one of the conservative leaders in post-modern politics, said the move to include Yiannopoulos as the keynote speaker is \u201csad and disappointing.\u201d\n\nStill, ACU chairman Matt Schlapp defended the decision in comments to the Hollywood Reporter, which broke the story about Yiannopoulos.\n\n\u201cAn epidemic of speech suppression has taken over college campuses,\u201d Schlapp told the news outlet. \u201cMilo has exposed their liberal thuggery and we think free speech includes hearing Milo\u2019s important perspective.\u201d\n\nThen on Sunday morning, less than one day after the controversial announcement about the CPAC speaker lineup, video surfaced of Yiannopoulos allegedly defending pedophilia in the past.\n\n\u201cWe get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff,\u201d Yiannopoulos is heard saying in a video, acknowledging that he has a controversial point of view, \u201cto the point where we are heavily policing consensual adults.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men \u2014 the sort of \u2018coming of age\u2019 relationship \u2014 those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can\u2019t speak to their parents,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like molestation to me,\u201d an unnamed person tells Yiannopoulos in reply, likely an interviewer. \u201cIt sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know what? I\u2019m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn\u2019t give nearly such good head if it wasn\u2019t for him,\u201d Yiannopoulos replied, using a euphemism for male oral sex.\n\nIn an interview with comedian Joe Rogan in 2015, Yiannopoulos discussed his sexual relationship with \u201cFather Michael,\u201d which he allegedly had as a teenager at age 14.\n\nDuring the interview, he even tried to normalize pedophilia.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019ve never seen a 15-year-old girl, at any point in your life, that you thought was hot?\u201d Yiannopoulos asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, when I was 15!\u201d Rogan replied. \u201cI\u2019m not retarded dude.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, when you were 25 or 30, you\u2019ve never seen girls you thought were hot?\u201d Yiannopoulos asked again.\n\n\u201cNo, I thought they were little kids!\u201d Rogan said.\n\nLater, Rogan called \u201cFather Michael\u201d a \u201cterrible person\u201d for allegedly having a sexual relationship with Yiannopoulos when he was a young teenager, but Yiannopoulos tried to downplay it.\n\nLater in the interview, Yiannopoulos talked about a Hollywood party he went to years ago that had \u201cvery young boys\u201d in attendance for sex.\n\nYiannopoulos has since responded to the allegations on Facebook Sunday afternoon denying them completely.\n\nThere\u2019s a video going around that purports to show me saying anti-semitic things (nope) and advocating for pedophilia (big nope). The shocking thing? It\u2019s Republicans doing it. Sad to see establishment types collapse into the same tactics as social justice warriors: name calling, deceptively edited videos, confected moral outrage and public shaming. This is why they deserve to burn \u2014 and why they are burning. Here\u2019s how I actually feel about pedophilia, which you\u2019d know if you\u2019d actually watched or read anything I\u2019ve ever done. Or, you know, if you had two brain cells to rub together. There\u2019s only one appropriate response to this sort of behavior, and it\u2019s a gigantic F**K YOU!\n\nIn addition, it appears that the ACU board was not consulted about Yiannopoulos being named a speaker at this years CPAC, let alone the keynote.\n\n\u201cThe ACU board was not consulted on this, nor was there a board vote,\u201d Ned Ryun wrote on Twitter Saturday, who sits on the ACU board.\n\nLast year\u2019s keynote speaker was conservative radio host Glenn Beck, who many criticized in 2016 for being an outspoken critic of then-candidate Donald Trump.

A few people nearby pointed him out, shouting his name.\n\nI had an immediate visceral reaction to the sight of this man, whom I consider to be a neo-Nazi. To my eyes, Gibson and his men were angling for conflict; their swagger left no doubt. And I stood there shaking, my homemade sign in hand. \u201cHate speech leads to Holocaust,\u201d it read.\n\nWe learned that the young men and women around us, dressed in all black, were trained not to engage in confrontations, except to protect demonstrators like us if we were attacked by white supremacists like Gibson.\n\nIt was my first encounter with the Antifas, the young militant antifascists who have been vilified in some of the media for their tactics. So even though I was afraid of Gibson and his thugs, I felt comforted, not by the presence of any police officer that day, but by the presence of the Antifas. I feel gratitude to these young people for being our first line of defense, for being willing to stand up to the hateful actions of neo-Nazis and white nationalists, like Gibson.\n\nI know from experience what it feels like not to feel protected. And I\u2019ve seen first-hand the impact hate speech, under the guise of free speech, can have. As a child in Nazi Germany, I saw young boys and girls being indoctrinated into becoming mass murderers of their neighbors. Later I learned how grown men, crippled by fear, were rendered incapable of protecting their loved ones. I learned that a crowd could be moved to heinous actions.\n\nFrom the time I was 5, I was told never to mention that our mother was Jewish. This was about the time my half-sister, my father\u2019s oldest daughter from his first marriage, unexpectedly came to live with us. She had seen her mother and stepfather violently removed from their home, never to be seen again.\n\nWhen I was 8, two sinister-looking Gestapo, the secret Nazi police, knocked on the door of our makeshift bomb shelter, a converted coal cellar. The city was under the final heavy bomb attacks of the Allied Forces. And the men had demanded that my mother accompany them, threatening to set their dog on her and shoot her if she tried to escape.\n\nEverybody in the cellar with us that day knew that my mother\u2019s only crime in life was being a Jew, defined not by her profession of a given religious preference but by racial law. Yet no one dared to speak up for this mother of three young children. Nobody said a word of encouragement as she was torn away from her children. Nobody demanded these men desist from sending one more Jew to her death in a concentration camp.\n\nThe time without our mother seemed endless. We were scared and hungry in that poorly lit, cold and uncomfortable cellar. Some of the neighbors had told us my mother would never return, and they had begun to discuss with which of them each of us children would have to live. My mother managed to escape and come back to us. But for the rest of my life, I have remembered the fear that crept over me as I faced the possibility of never seeing her again.\n\nSoon the bombing ceased, and the Soviet Army liberated our neighborhood. But I saw the photos in the newspapers of some of the millions who had not been as lucky as we had, who had had no one to protect them. I could not trust that such an experience would not repeat itself.\n\nIn 1947, my mother, my younger brother and I immigrated to Venezuela and learned there what life was like under a long military Latin American style dictatorship. Once again, I saw how some people were scared and read how some were detained, deported, and even killed. Again, I was not sure who would defend us if something happened to our family.\n\nAnd when I came to study in the U.S. in 1955, in what I had erroneously believed was the cradle of freedom, I had a real-life crash course in the lack of civil rights for people of color, the murderous laws still prevalent in many Southern states, and the education, employment, and housing discrimination in the North. I later learned a startling truth: that the racial laws of the Nazis, which categorized me as a Jew of the Second Degree (mother a Jew, father not), were based on U.S. race laws. I had fallen for some of the powerful propaganda this country disseminates abroad through its mass media. But I woke up and got involved. I learned to speak up and organize for civil rights, against the war in Vietnam, and later against the many invasions of other countries and ongoing discrimination.\n\nAnd now here I am, more than 70 years after walking out of that dank cellar in a Berlin neighborhood, faced once again with neo-Nazis spewing and spreading their hate and beliefs around white supremacy. Their goal is to create divisions in university towns such as Berkeley, hoping that they can sow seeds of discord and animus among students. And that scares me.\n\nFar too many people in this country are still excluded and even killed for reasons that were also used during World War II to send populations to the gas chambers. We don\u2019t have concentration camps as such in the U.S., but the prison-industrial complex is thriving and ever-expanding immigrant detention centers are crowded and inhumane.\n\nSo, yes, I am scared of what fascists can do. I have little confidence that local police\u2014ever more heavily armed with military weaponry and unskilled in dealing with the vulnerable in our societies\u2014will protect those confronted by the neo-Nazis.\n\nRecently I was kept awake by news helicopters flying overhead to capture the anticipated confrontations between people attempting to hear a prominent white supremacist and those expected to protest his presence on University of California, Berkeley, campus. Professors and students had called for a walkout and suspension of classes. Now the university has ordered a week of free speech with guest speakers I feel are more interested in hate speech, among them Steve Bannon, Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos. What irony, I thought, that a university noted for its student-led, anti-war and free speech movements during the 1960s, would host a roster of speakers, not a single one a defender of human rights. Are universities silencing ideas, as was the case in Nazi Germany? Is the climate so unsafe that students and professors prefer to cancel classes?\n\nAs the Trump administration has threatened to deport \u201cDreamers,\u201d young immigrants brought as children to this country, I recall the Nazi laws that forced students classified as undesirable in the Third Reich to abandon their dreams for a future.\n\nIn Arizona and other school systems in the U.S, efforts have been made to ban books to exclude from their curricula the rich histories of the multiple nationalities that make up this nation.\n\nBrown and black children and youth receive criminal treatment for minor infractions and, along with their families, live under constant threats to their lives, as statistics of death and incarcerations prove. Many of these children and youth attend underfinanced and inadequately staffed schools, deprived of the kind of education every child deserves\u2014in much the way my siblings and I were barred from schools in Germany.\n\nMake no mistake, these neo-Nazis and white supremacists are serious. The recent murders in Portland and Charlottesville demonstrate that. In Europe, different generations of young antifascists committed to preventing acts of violence to vulnerable populations, resurface from time to time. I feel comforted by the fact that these young antifascists exist here in America, too."}, "http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hunter-dies-after-shot-elephant-falls-on-him-20170521?": {"title": "Hunter dies after elephant falls on him", "keywords": ["zimbabwe", " animals", " hunting"], "url": "http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hunter-dies-after-shot-elephant-falls-on-him-20170521?", "text": "Johannesburg - A professional big game hunter from Tzaneen, Theunis Botha, 51, died on Friday afternoon during a hunt in Gwai, in Zimbabwe, when a member of his group fired at a storming elephant cow and the animal fell on him.\n\nA source who didn\u2019t want to be named told Netwerk24 that a group of hunters had gone for a walk on Friday afternoon when they suddenly came across a breeding herd of elephants.\n\nThree elephant cows stormed the hunters and Botha shot at them.

That conclusion was reached, Assange said, \u201cdespite improper pressure from the US and UK governments on the UN.\u201d\n\nAssange warned of the increasing intersection between Google, now the world\u2019s largest media company, and the US military industrial complex, in particular highlighting Google\u2019s escalating investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, largely for \u2018national security\u2019 applications by the US military and intelligence community.\n\n\u201cGoogle is integrating AI systems with the national security system,\u201d said Assange. \u201cThis is a threat to mankind. We must stop feeding Google.\u201d\n\nHe urged the public to explore alternative online services to mitigate Google\u2019s ability to sweep up vast quantities of personal data into AI systems co-opted by the Pentagon.\n\nBoth Assange and Snowden argued that the rapid centralisation of control of information communication technologies within a private corporate sector increasingly enmeshed with the security-state, represents a fundamental threat to functioning democracies, particularly a free press.\n\n\u201cWe have to accept that the only way to protect the rights of one, is to protect the rights of all,\u201d said Snowden. \u201cIncreasingly this is seen as a threat to government because it represents a domain in which they will no longer be able to intervene.\u201d\n\nDescribing President Obama\u2019s stance on the Apple-FBI dispute as a \u201cfalse dichotomy between privacy and security,\u201d he stated that \u201cyou need both\u201d, and can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\nSnowden added that the use of metadata to target people as threats to national security sets a dangerous precedent, with wide scope for miscarriages of justice against everyday citizens. A person who simply communicated with a journalist breaking a story based on information from a government whistleblower, for instance, could end up being convicted as the source \u2014 even if they were not the source \u2014 based on the use of metadata linking them circumstantially to the journalist.\n\n\u201cWhether or not you were the source, if you simply communicated with the journalist, you could be convicted,\u201d said Snowden.\n\nIn Britain, the Tory government is attempting to push through a particularly draconian piece of legislation, the Investigatory Powers Bill (IP Bill), which would grant the state extraordinary powers to interfere with journalism. The bill, which if passed could set a precedent for other Western countries, is due to receive a second reading in parliament on Tuesday, 15th March.\n\nAccording to the National Union of Journalists, the bill will grant the government powers to access journalists\u2019 communications and hack their electronic equipment, including intercepting the content and metadata of their communications, without informing them.\n\nDespite significant opposition from various parliamentary committees, including the Joint Committee on the Investigatory Powers Bill, subsequent government re-drafts have only worsened its provisions.\n\nAccording to Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary, the IP Bill:\n\nMetadata, of course, is already used in a wide range of contexts by the intelligence community to identify not just terrorism suspects, but also activists, human rights groups, and others critical of government policy.\n\nIncreasingly, signature drone strikes against unidentified groups of suspected terrorist targets in theatres like Syria, Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan are based solely on metadata gleaned through surveillance of mobile phones, social media profiles, and other electronic information repositories. This has led to countless civilian casualties.\n\nMetadata from numerous electronic sources, including social media, is increasingly being seen by the Pentagon, as well as UK and EU security agencies, as a vast repository of easily attainable \u2018open source\u2019 intelligence to attempt to predict, and control, the behaviour of human populations.\n\nAs I reported in February, unclassified official documents from the US Office of Naval Research among other Pentagon research programmes throw light on the alarming \u2018minority report\u2019-style ambitions of US government officials in terms of wanting to precisely anticipate and predict future activism, protests, crime, terrorism, conflicts and state-failures. Yet independent experts note that such technologies are more likely to generate false positives and red-herrings, rather than forecasts of real predictive value.\n\nEdward Snowden advocated the careful use and advancement of encryption technologies by journalists to help protect sources, but noted that technology alone is not the answer.\n\nOne new powerful technology, a complete operating system known as SubGraph OS which can be installed onto a PC or Mac to provide a full range of encrypted communication tools, was launched at the conference. SubGraph is the latest in several different but similar tools, such as Tails \u2014 an operating system that can be booted up on any computer through a USB drive \u2014 and Qubes, another system requiring installation on specifically tailored security hardened computers.\n\nDesigners of these projects at the conference warned, however, that while these tools are powerful, they do not offer guarantees against government surveillance, especially due to the possibility of as yet unknown built-in \u2018backdoors\u2019 in both mainstream software and hardware.\n\n\u201cThey are truly great projects,\u201d said Snowden, highlighting SubGraph OS in particular: \u201cI plan to use this myself. But we have to recognise that these are inaccessible for the majority of users, for journalists, who aren\u2019t specialists.\u201d\n\nThe challenge for technologists is to develop friendlier and more accessible user-interfaces which can be learned by laypeople as you go. Snowden suggested exploring the \u2018gamification\u2019 of the learning curve for such tools to make the experience of getting to grips with them easier.\n\nSnowden also encouraged technologists to \u201ccompete directly with these billion dollar corporate interests\u201d like Google, Facebook and Apple. There\u2019s a chance, he said, that citizen-led entrepreneurship could be \u201cmore successful, creating products that are just as attractive, more easy to use, but aren\u2019t as dangerous to the individual\u2019s rights to be free and associate in a free and safe way.\u201d\n\nEdward Snowden also warned against assuming that attempting to counter state surveillance through encryption alone would be a panacea, advocating the need to fundamentally challenge the centralisation of power over information technologies in state-corporate hands.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing entirely too much control of institutions we\u2019re supposed to be able to trust, but we cannot trust,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re seeing corporations get access to our private lives, in ways we didn\u2019t anticipate and we\u2019re not aware of how its being used.\u201d\n\nSnowden dismissed the idea that privacy or liberty stood somehow counterposed to genuine security.\n\nThe Boston marathon bombings, he said, provided a clear example of the bankruptcy of the surveillance-for-security mantra \u2014 the perpetrators, despite operating in the context of \u201cthe largest dragnet programme in the history of my country\u201d had remained undetected.\n\nIn a panel on Friday, Thomas Drake \u2014 the former senior NSA executive who inspired Snowden to blow the whistle by exposing the flaws of the agency\u2019s billion dollar Trailblazer mass surveillance project \u2014 recalled how his NSA bosses cynically saw the 9/11 intelligence failure as an opportunity to increase the agency\u2019s budget dramatically.\n\nThe idea that mass surveillance has any prospect of genuinely keeping us safe is thus deeply questionable. The fundamental problem with the insistence on eliminating privacy in the name of security is its totalitarian impact across our entire societies.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about what rights are for? Where do they come from? What are their values? What is privacy for, really?\u201d Snowden told the audience at the CIJ gathering.\n\nIf mass surveillance was simply about thwarting terrorism, its targets would not consistently be political dissidents, Snowden argued, pointing to the famous \u2018I have a dream\u2019 speech by Martin Luther King Jr \u2014 described by Snowden as the \u201cgreatest civil rights leader my country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nTwo days after that speech, Snowden said, the FBI assessed King to be \u201cthe greatest threat to national security\u201d at the time.\n\nLittle has changed since then.\n\nThe former intelligence contractor pointed out that Britain\u2019s signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, has unlawfully spied on human rights groups like Amnesty International, journalists, media figures and other NGOs, \u201cusing powers passed publicly to thwart terrorists.\u201d\n\nCiting the top secret documents he had leaked, he noted that internal justification for keeping such programmes classified made no reference to national security issues. Instead, the documents said that \u201cpublicising them would lead to a \u2018damaging public debate\u2019 because we [the public] would protest these activities.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that the national security state sees the very fundamentals of vibrant democracies \u2014 a truly free press, vigorous public debate, oversight over highly classified intelligence policies \u2014 as the enemy.\n\nThe dismissal of the importance of rights of privacy, Snowden said, is a function of unequal power. The whistleblower urged his listeners to consider how the demand to eliminate privacy comes from powerful people \u201cin a position of privilege\u2026 If you\u2019re an old white guy at the top of the pyramid, society is ordered to protect your interests. You designed the system to protect your interests.\u201d\n\nThis inequality in power, Snowden said, means that \u201cit\u2019s the minorities who are most at risk\u201d from the impact of mass surveillance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to think about these things, it\u2019s not enough to believe in something,\u201d concluded Snowden to resounding applause. \u201cYou have to actually stand for something, you have to actually say something, you have to actually risk something, if you want things to get better.\u201d\n\nDr Nafeez Ahmed is an investigative journalist, bestselling author and international security scholar.

Trump", " Joe Arpaio"], "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/when-i-filmed-sheriff-joe-arpaio-he-was-cooperative-and-horrifying", "text": "In 2001, I made a documentary film for German TV about the man who called himself \u201cThe Toughest Sheriff in America.\u201d Ten years after I witnessed Joe Arpaio in action, a judge ordered him to stop detaining people based solely on racial profiling. Yet Arpaio continued to flout the law, and he faced up to six months in prison for criminal contempt of law. Before Arpaio was sentenced, President Trump pardoned him.\n\nWhen I proposed the Arpaio documentary to my German clients, they were skeptical. They had trouble believing that his kind of law-enforcement abuse was really happening, and, if so, they weren\u2019t confident I would able to capture it on camera. In the end, my clients were intrigued enough, because deep in the German unconscious there is still the image of the U.S. as the Wild West, a place where the toughest guy with the fastest gun will determine what Law and Order means. Sheriff Joe represented the essence of the evil clich\u00e9 Germans remember from these fictional old Westerns. In my film, Arpaio even compared himself to these old movies, saying if he would ever have to retire, he would not exactly vanish by riding into the sunset, but he would vanish because he wouldn\u2019t know what to do with himself.\n\nThere was no problem getting the man to cooperate. He craved the spotlight and behaved obnoxiously to satisfy the camera. Despite his cooperation, the filming became more difficult by the day because my crew developed such disgust and hatred for the man that I feared they would turn violent. We all started to feel dirty because we realized in some sick way we were feeding his oversized ego.\n\nWhen I told Arpaio I needed a good beginning for my film, some kind of \u201cbang,\u201d he took it literally. He owned a tank he liked to ride in parades, and while we were filming in the courtyard of the jail, the tank appeared and fired its cannon. It was indeed a very loud \u201cbang.\u201d\n\nAlready back then Arpaio was in legal trouble. He had a website with a live feed showing people getting booked. The website came with a warning that one might witness violence or even sexually explicit content, which of course drew many viewers.\n\nSurveillance cameras also captured unruly detainees getting strapped into a chair and then tortured with stun guns. One inmate, Scott Norberg, died in the restraining chair. The Phoenix New Times compared the video material to watching a snuff film.\n\nMaricopa County and the sheriff\u2019s office had to pay an $8.25 million settlement for the Norberg case alone. At least 60 people died in Arpaio\u2019s county jail and many more got injured. Richard Post, a paraplegic, was pulled out of his wheelchair and cinched violently into a restraint chair, causing permanent damage to his neck and shoulders. At the time of my film project there were already hundreds of lawsuits against all of the sheriff\u2019s divisions, and the department had amassed to a total of $14.7 million in settlements in the previous five years. Yet the majority of Maricopa County residents kept voting for Arpaio and supplied millions of dollars to his campaign efforts.\n\nWhen I asked him about human rights, Arpaio said, \u201cHuman rights violations? Amnesty International? They should all go back where they came from\u2014to Iraq\u2014instead of telling me how to do my job.\u201d\n\nHe bragged about his prison tents because, in his opinion, detainees don\u2019t deserve air conditioning during the scorching hot summer months or heat in the cold Arizona winters. His prisoners had to wear striped prison suits and pink underwear. In 2001, brunch was a new fad and Arpaio decided he should imitate the trend and cut down the three rotten daily prison meals to two. The women in the tent cities told me horrifying stories about the lack of medical attention. One woman in a tent claimed she had a miscarriage in her fifth month of pregnancy, without ever getting medical help.\n\nI witnessed the brutality of it all. Arpaio said he believed in equal rights for women, so women were also put into striped suits and chain gangs. I took my mutinous crew and accompanied the women to their workplace\u2014an empty, windswept stretch of desert, the paupers\u2019 graveyard. Their duty was to dig graves. As they were shoveling dirt onto a coffin, all the women cried. They told me they were afraid that one day they would end up just like this. One woman sobbed harder than the others. She told me she had buried her own father in one of these graves.\n\nThe filming became downright surreal when I interviewed Arpaio\u2019s bleached-blond wife, Ava. \u201cMy husband is just a big teddy bear,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has a good heart. He loves his prisoners, it\u2019s just a kind of tough love. For him prisoners are like little children who have to be punished. When kids do something bad, you also send them to bed without dinner. He thinks the prisoners have to be disciplined because they never learned any discipline.\u201d\n\nEven spookier than Arpaio himself was his \u201cposse\u201d\u2014thousands of deputies who were nothing but geezers with guns. This posse would become infamous during the Obama administration because they were all \u201cbirthers\u201d and worked hard to prove the lie that the president was not a natural-born citizen of the United States. Maricopa County is the land of gated communities for retirees. Many of these old people told me they were bored with their daily golf or macram\u00e9 classes, and that\u2019s why they joined the \u201cposse.\u201d It was like a hobby to them. All they had to do was buy a gun, a uniform, and a car. Then Arpaio slapped a sheriff star on their chests and off they went, enforcing law and order. At the time I was filming, Arpaio\u2019s posse was 3,600-people strong, and many of them seemed too old to even drive a car. Yet they patrolled the streets, frequently singling out Hispanics.\n\nWhen my film, The Toughest Sheriff in America, aired on German TV, so many Germans flooded Arpaio\u2019s website to vent their outrage that the site crashed. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a major German newspaper, wrote: \u201cWherever he finds an audience he becomes the horse-mounted guardian for law and order, an image taken straight out of a tattered fictional children\u2019s book or a movie. In his mind the golden dreamed-up past is still alive, and because he is the sheriff he has the power to turn it into reality.\u201d Viewers wrote angry emails to the TV station, asking for more information on why and how this is allowed to keep going on in a First World country. Germans wanted to have Arpaio tried in The Hague, and they were convinced that his behavior was unconstitutional. Some even suspected that the film was staged, a fictional mockumentary about the U.S.\n\nArpaio was sheriff for 24 years before he was voted out of office last November. It wasn\u2019t until July 31 of this year that he was finally convicted of a crime\u2014and then only for a contempt-of-court misdemeanor, not for the vicious and deadly abuse of law-enforcement power.\n\nFor the abuse, the racial discrimination, the killings and mistreatment of prisoners, Maricopa County was held responsible\u2014never the sheriff himself. The county and its insurers had to pay the multimillion-dollar settlements. Most of the people whose rights Arpaio violated never sought justice in a court.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Arpaio is Trump\u2019s soul mate. In my mind, the real scandal is that I met this man 16 years ago and knew he was evil to the bone. Yet he stayed in office and was able to flout the law, the Constitution, and basic human rights for 24 years. And he doesn\u2019t have to pay for any of it."}, "https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au/videos/10156091045769988/?hc_location=ufi": {"title": "ABC News", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au/videos/10156091045769988/?hc_location=ufi", "text": "To help personalise content, tailor and measure ads and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

It is false to speak of a National Socialist philosophy, for if there were \n\nsuch an entity, one would have to try by means of analysis and discussion either to prove its validity or to \n\ncombat it. In actuality, however, we face a totally different situation.\n\n\n\nAt its very inception this movement depended on the deception and betrayal of one's fellow man; even at \n\nthat time it was inwardly corrupt and could support itself only by constant lies. After all, Hitler states in an \n\nearly edition of \"his\" book (a book written in the worst German I have ever read, in spite of the fact that it \n\nhas been elevated to the position of the Bible in this nation of poets and thinkers): \"It is unbelievable, to \n\nwhat extent one must betray a people in order to rule it.\"\n\n\n\nIf at the start this cancerous growth in the nation was not particularly noticeable, it was only because there \n\nwere still enough forces at work that operated for the good, so that it was kept under control. As it grew \n\nlarger, however, and finally in an ultimate spurt of growth attained ruling power, the tumor broke open, as it \n\nwere, and infected the whole body. The greater part of its former opponents went into hiding. The German \n\nintellectuals fled to their cellars, there, like plants struggling in the dark, away from light and sun, gradually \n\nto choke to death.\n\n\n\nNow the end is at hand. Now it is our task to find one another again, to spread information from person to \n\nperson, to keep a steady purpose, and to allow ourselves no rest until the last man in persuaded of the \n\nurgent need of his struggle against this system. When thus a wave of unrest goes through the land, when \n\n\"it is in the air\", when many join the cause, then in a great final effort this system can be shaken off. After \n\nall, and end in terror is preferable to terror without end.\n\n\n\nWe are not in a position to draw up a final judgment about the meaning of our history. But if this \n\ncatastrophe can be used to further the public welfare, it will be only by virtue of the fact that we are \n\ncleansed by suffering; that we yearn for the light in the midst of deepest night, summon our strength, and \n\nfinally help in shaking off the yoke which weighs on our world.\n\n\n\nWe do not want to discuss here the question of the Jews, nor do we want in this leaflet to compose a \n\ndefense or apology. No, only by way of example do we want to cite the fact that since the conquest of \n\nPoland three hundred thousand Jews have been murdered in this country in the most bestial way. Here we \n\nsee the most frightful crime against human dignity, a crime that is unparalleled in the whole of history. For \n\nJews, too, are human beings - no matter what position we take with respect to the Jewish question - and a \n\ncrime of this dimension has been perpetrated against human beings.\n\n\n\nSomeone may say that the Jews deserved their fate. This assertion would be a monstrous impertinence; \n\nbut let us assume that someone said this - what position has he then taken toward the fact that the entire \n\nPolish aristocratic youth is being annihilated? (May God grant that this program has not fully achieved its \n\naim as yet!) All male offspring of the houses of the nobility between the ages of fifteen and twenty were \n\ntransported to concentration camps in Germany and sentenced to forced labor, and the girls of this age \n\ngroup were sent to Norway, into the bordellos of the SS!\n\n\n\nWhy tell you these things, since you are fully aware of them - or if not of these, then of other equally grave \n\ncrimes committed by this frightful sub-humanity? Because here we touch on a problem which involves us \n\ndeeply and forces us all to take thought. Why do the German people behave so apathetically in the face of \n\nall these abominable crimes, crimes so unworthy of the human race? Hardly anyone thinks about that. It is \n\naccepted as fact and put out of mind. The German people slumber on in their dull, stupid sleep and \n\nencourage these fascist criminals; they give them the opportunity to carry on their depredations; and of \n\ncourse they do so. Is this a sign that the Germans are brutalized in their simplest human feelings, that no \n\nchord within them cried out at the sight of such deeds, that they have sunk into a fatal consciencelessness \n\nfrom which they will never, never awake?\n\n\n\nIt seems to be so, and will certainly be so, if the German does not at least start up out of his stupor, if he \n\ndoes not protest wherever and whenever he can against this clique of criminals, if he shows no sympathy \n\nfor these hundreds of thousands of victims. He must evidence not only sympathy; no, much more: a sense \n\nof complicity in guilt. For through his apathetic behavior he gives these evil men the opportunity to act as \n\nthey do; he tolerates this \"government\" which has taken upon itself such an infinitely great burden of guilt; \n\nindeed, he himself is to blame for the fact that it came about at all! Each man wants to be exonerated of a \n\nguilt of this kind, each one continues on his way with the most placid, the calmest conscience. But he \n\ncannot be exonerated; he is guilty, guilty, guilty!\n\n\n\nIt is not too late, however, to do away with this most reprehensible of all miscarriages of government, so \n\nas to avoid being burdened with even greater guilt. Now, when in recent years our eyes have been \n\nopened, when we know exactly who our adversary is, it is high time to root out this brown horde. Up until \n\nthe outbreak of the war the larger part of the German people were blinded; the Nazis did not show \n\nthemselves in their true aspect. But now, now that we have recognized them for what they are, it must be \n\nthe sole and first duty, the holiest duty of every German to destroy these beasts.\n\n\n\n \"If the people are barely aware that the government exists, they are happy. When the government \n\n is felt to be oppressive, they are broken. \" \"Good fortune, alas! builds itself upon misery. Good \n\n fortune, alas! is the mask of misery. What will come of this?

Watch these videos! Net neutrality is the principle that Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon should not control what we see and do online. In 2015, startups, Internet freedom groups, and 3.7 million commenters won strong net neutrality rules from the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The rules prohibit Internet providers from blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization\u2014\"fast lanes\" for sites that pay, and slow lanes for everyone else. Want to learn more? Watch these videos!\n\nWe are Team Internet. We support net neutrality, freedom of speech. Nearly everyone who understands and depends on the Internet supports net neutrality, whether they're startup founders, activists, gamers, politicians, investors, comedians, YouTube stars, or typical Internet users who just want their Internet to work as advertised\u2014regardless of their political party. Even some of the biggest and most interesting sites in the world have joined in unprecedented, historic protests to defend net neutrality.

They want to end net neutrality, to control & tax the Internet.\n\nCable companies are famous for high prices and poor service. Several rank as the most hated companies in America. Now, they're lobbying the FCC and Congress to end net neutrality. Why? It's simple: if they win the power to slow sites down, they can bully any site into paying millions to escape the \"slow lane.\" This would amount to a tax on every sector of the American economy. Every site would cost more, since they'd all have to pay big cable. Worse, it would extinguish the startups and independent voices who can't afford to pay. If we lose net neutrality, the Internet will never be the same.\n\nNow, we must convince Congress to stop the FCC. Can you display an alert on your site? Congress can vote to stop the FCC, but to make that happen we need a massive volume of phone calls to Congress.

They allege the now-retired officer referred to African-Americans using various racial slurs and instructed his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to intimidate African-Americans, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Wednesday.\n\nNucera, 60, is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera \u201chas a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as \u2018n****rs\u2019\u201d and Italian-derived racial slurs for African-Americans. One of Nucera\u2019s officers \u201cmade numerous recordings\u201d of Nucera that \u201ccontained extremely offensive racist comments\u201d over the course of a year because he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Nucera\u2019s racism, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn\u2019t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police \u201cescalated into a physical struggle,\u201d that both teens \u201cresisted arrest\u201d and that one of the officers used pepper spray.\n\nAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera allegedly grabbed the 18-year-old\u2019s head and slammed it \u201cinto the right side of the metal doorjamb,\u201d according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old\u2019s head make \u201ca loud thud\u201d as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn\u2019t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had \u201cstopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.\u201d The use of force wasn\u2019t reported to the department.\n\nHours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was \u201cfucking tired\u201d of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cAnd that n****r bitch lady, she almost got it,\u201d he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl\u2019s aunt, who was present at the arrest. \u201cFucking nipple hanging bitch. I\u2019m so tired of them, man.\u201d\n\nNucera allegedly said that black people should \u201cstay the fuck out of Bordentown\u201d and referred to the 18-year-old as \u201cfucking little, fucking n****r.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to \u201cput my hands\u201d on him.\n\n\u201cThese n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cThey should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\nNucera also \u201cinstructed police officers to bring canines to certain games and position the canine vehicles at the entrance to the gymnasium in order to intimidate African American patrons,\u201d according to the FBI. In another instance, Nucera allegedly told an officer to walk a police dog through an apartment complex so African-American residents could see him.\n\nWilliam Fitzpatrick, New Jersey\u2019s acting top federal prosecutor, said in a statement that Nucera \u201cdishonored the profession\u201d and harbored \u201cintense racial animosity\u201d and senseless hatred of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cThe conduct alleged is a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and never to mistreat a person in custody,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nSteve Benewitz, the mayor of Bordentown Township, said in a statement sent to HuffPost on Wednesday afternoon that the charges were \u201climited to one person, and are not indicative of the Bordentown Township Police Department, or the Township as a whole.\u201d He called the charges \u201cabhorrent,\u201d and said it was important to note that they \u201cbegan from a self-reported complaint from within the Township Police Department.\u201d\n\nBordentown has about 11,000 people and is located south of Trenton and a little over an hour outside of Philadelphia. The Trentonian reported in January that Nucera was mysteriously \u201cMIA\u201d and that officials said the police chief had retired amid rumors that he was under criminal investigation. His salary was reported to be $147,724 per year.\n\nFederal court records do not indicate that Nucera has an attorney.

First, I explain how my friend Tyler and I entered a fur farm in the dead of night. I describe the unspeakable suffering we found there. I tell people how Tyler and I opened every single cage and released 2,000 mink to save their lives. And once they have the context, I segue into the terrorism thing.\n\nNow that I have been out of prison for more than a year, I can be a bit more lighthearted about it. But the seventh circuit court of appeals doesn\u2019t see the humor.\n\nLast Wednesday, the court upheld the constitutionality of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, the federal statute that put me away for three years and that my lawyers at the Center for Constitutional Rights have been trying to challenge for nearly a decade.\n\nThe Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act is a piece of designer legislation written and paid for by the agriculture and pharmaceutical industries. It federalizes non-violent property crime and punishes it as terrorism \u2013 but only when the perpetrators are motivated by the belief that animals deserve to live free from violence.\n\nThe court explicitly stated that the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act did not apply to four Fresno, California, teenagers who sneaked into a Foster Farms facility and bludgeoned 900 chickens to death with a golf club because \u201cthey killed the chickens for no reason\u201d.\n\nPut succinctly, I am a terrorist not because of what I did, but because the government dislikes why I did it.\n\nI remember organizing my first protest, outside of the circus, in 2005. I was 19 years old. My friend and I argued with the police about whether our group could stand on a courtyard by the Staples Center and whether we could use megaphones. We asserted our rights, and we were successful.\n\nThat same year, the FBI declared animal rights activists to be the nation\u2019s \u201cnumber one domestic terrorism threat\u201d. A year later, Congress passed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. Suddenly, I found myself being followed as I drove to work. My parents and siblings were harassed. My home was raided by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Three times.\n\nWe no longer argued with the police about where we could chant and hold our signs. The police brandished assault rifles, and we did as they said. Then, when we were done, they openly followed us back to our cars to photograph our license plates. While the rest of the nation took no notice, simply organizing a protest became a frightening prospect if you were an animal rights activist.\n\nIn this atmosphere, more and more of my friends stopped speaking out for animals. Countless times I heard people say they were scared of being placed on a list. More than once, someone told me they had canceled their subscriptions to animal-related magazines.\n\nThe Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act achieved its intended outcome. When the distinguishing feature of a \u201cterrorist\u201d is simply an ethical concern for animals, such concerns become marginalized, and voicing them becomes dangerous. What remains is silence.\n\nNow I watch as the rhetoric honed and the precedents established against animal rights activists are expanded to cover an increasingly broad swath of dissent. In Donald Trump\u2019s America, states across the country are introducing legislation designed to bully and deter protesters. Some of these proposed laws include five-year prison sentences for protesters who block traffic.\n\nLawmakers in Arizona seek to charge protest groups as organized criminals, and seize their assets. In Oregon, a statute would automatically expel students who violate protest laws. Missouri wants to criminalize the use of costumes during protests. And, following the horrors of Charlottesville, lawmakers in half a dozen states have introduced legislation to indemnify drivers who run over protesters, as if the drivers were the ones in need of protection.\n\nThis is not how a free society operates. Our rights are meaningless if the government intimidates us out of using them. But as Wednesday\u2019s decision makes clear, the judiciary will not protect us from such abuse. The court has legitimized the government\u2019s use of the word \u201cterrorism\u201d to describe nearly any activity of which it disapproves \u2013 and emboldened lawmakers around the country who are beginning to do just that.\n\nIt is evident that our leaders consider our speech and assembly a threat to their unencumbered exercise of power. Now, more than ever, we must show them that they are right."}, "http://chicagoist.com/2017/09/19/man_arrested_for_burning_flag_gets.php": {"title": "Man Arrested For Burning Flag Gets $15K In Settlement, Then Again Posts Photo Of Burning Flag", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://chicagoist.com/2017/09/19/man_arrested_for_burning_flag_gets.php", "text": "An Illinois man will be awarded thousands of dollars after he settled his lawsuit against the Urbana Police Department, which arrested him last year after he posted a photo of himself burning the American flag.

The MPD trapped, or \"kettled\", more than 200 people, arresting them on a single felony riot charge with a boilerplate affidavit.\n\nThe march was an act of resistance against both Trump and the system that gives him power. As a part of this march, I was also kettled and arrested alongside scores of others. Nearly six months later, I and more than 200 other people have been re-indicted on eight felonies each. We all currently face the potential of 75 years in federal prison.\n\nCertain memories of the day of my arrest stand most vividly in my mind: zip-ties cutting into my wrist and the taste of pepper spray; losing count of the roaches that crawled over me in my sleep; the constant horror of not knowing where my partner was.\n\nAccording to a report issued in February by the DC Office of Police Complaints, the MPD unleashed a variety of \"less-than-lethal\" weapons against protesters - without warning or direct provocation - as a general crowd control tactic. \"Less-than-lethal\" is a very broad euphemism. Thinking about the violence of the police that day, I remember the footage of an elderly woman brutalised by a river of pepper spray and saved from a phalanx of riot police by a black-clad protester. I recall a fellow arrestee in my cell unit with an eye bulging out of its socket like a tomato - the offspring of pepper spray and contact lenses - and how we had to demand they receive medical attention.\n\nREAD MORE: Anti-Trump protester - 'Is this my last free birthday?'\n\nWatching the footage from the arrest made me relive the concussion grenades that exploded in the streets. I am reminded of the mutilation of Sophia Wilansky's arm at Standing Rock by a similar \"stinger\", while the police dowsed hundreds of water protectors with water cannon in below freezing temperatures. I remember the blood-soaked pavement outside the Omni Hotel when the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department murdered Justin Carr with a rubber bullet to the head during the Charlotte uprising last September.\n\nThese tactics are not new in Washington, DC. In 2002, then Assistant Police Chief Peter Newsham ordered the mass arrest of over 400 people in Pershing Park during protests against the World Bank. The mass arrest ultimately cost the city more than $8m in a civil suit that ruled it an unlawful act of police misconduct.\n\nAs acting police chief, Newsham also issued the order for the inauguration day mass arrest. Despite the spectre of yet another brutal mass arrest, Newsham was appointed police chief by DC Mayor Muriel E Bowser and the DC Council in May.\n\nWith a pending lawsuit challenging Newsham's abusive practices, it remains to be seen what he will cost the working people of DC this time. A civil suit has already been initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the current investigation into police conduct will cost approximately $150,000, which is $50,000 more than the estimated damage of the alleged events on Inauguration Day.\n\nTo understand the extremity of the charges brought against us in this case, the arrests need to be viewed through the lens of political repression. Across the country, thousands of people are engaged in resistance against the daily operations of the capital and the state, fighting to survive the crises that this system constantly produces. Almost immediately after our arrests, thousands of people occupied and shut down airports to reject what has become known as the Muslim Ban. Camps have formed in Florida and Pennsylvania to blockade the development of the Sabal Trail Pipeline and Mariner 2 Pipeline. An encampment has formed outside of the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, WA, to support undocumented immigrants that have been resisting forced prison labour through hunger strikes. In major towns across the country, from Portland to Olympia to Houston, marginalised communities have disrupted fascist/white-nationalist rallies in self-defence amid an astronomical spike in hate crimes and right-wing violence.\n\nREAD MORE: US anti-fascists take on alt-right fight squads\n\nNone of this resistance can be tolerated. The state's main social function is specifically to suppress public outrage, either by redirecting it into preconfigured campaigns or through political repression.\n\nThe prosecutor would like to depoliticise the charges we are facing, but the reality is that this case is not about so-called \"criminal behaviour\": This case is about turning protesters into felons, and the criminalisation of resistance. The state is perfectly willing to permit thousands of people to wear safety pins and pussyhats, march along well-policed parade routes, and powerlessly petition their authorities for change - so long as they do not shatter the illusion of everyday politics or disrupt the constant flow of capital.\n\nBut what Standing Rock and Black Lives Matter have taught us all is that if a community's resistance is perceived as effective then the full measure of state violence will be used to neutralise it. Standing Rock prevented the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline for months before its eviction by legions of police. The executions of Mike Brown and Freddie Gray produced demonstrations of such tremendous pain and outcry that they seized Ferguson and Baltimore, and were stomped out by the National Guard.\n\nThe events of January 20 represented a similar disruption: The march shut down the roads of DC, and the magnitude of the MPD's violent response shattered the fragile spectacle of the inauguration. Business-as-usual was put on hold, and the consequence is that everyone rounded-up and arrested must now be made an example of. The superseding indictment and its additional felony charges are a means to coerce defendants into accepting plea deals against their will.\n\nThe goal is not to convict people to 75 years in prison. The severity of the threat is intended to extract as many guilty pleas as possible, while sending a clear message to potential protesters that the consequences of opposition will be grave. These pleas are needed to vindicate the state's narrative and legitimise their repression. The intention is to set a legal precedent for mass arrests in the era of constant crisis, so that future social movements can be smothered in the cradle.\n\nREAD MORE: More Americans joining socialist groups under Trump\n\nRegardless, we're six months into this case and hundreds of defendants have committed to pursuing trials in a round of status hearings this month. A growing number of defendants have committed to rejecting pleas that aren't universally offered to all co-defendants, and over 100 have agreed to reject any cooperation with the state. Fundraisers have been organised by defendants and defence committees to gather the funds for legal and travel costs. The Mid-Atlantic General Defense Committee has initiated a support campaign to drop the charges.\n\nWhen repression strikes our communities, solidarity becomes our strongest defence. While this process has been traumatic, it has produced countless beautiful relationships of support among co-defendants, supporters, and our communities. Those relationships and bonds of trust have the power to resist this political persecution, and we will continue to organise a collective defence together.\n\nCarlo Piantini is a social activist, community organiser, and political defendant in the federal case against Inauguration Day protesters.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy."}, "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mccain-return-washington-crucial-health-care-vote-n786121": {"title": "John McCain to return Tuesday for crucial health care vote", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mccain-return-washington-crucial-health-care-vote-n786121", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With a razor-thin margin for success in the balance, Sen.

McCain recently underwent surgery to remove a blood clot near his brain and was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor last week.\n\nStill, less than 24 hours before an expected vote to begin debate on health care, Senate Republicans still haven\u2019t been told exactly what kind of reform they will ultimately be voting on, creating even more uncertainty about the chances of gaining a majority of Republicans needed to proceed.\n\nTuesday's vote on a motion to proceed to debate on health care legislation will take place after a Republican policy luncheon where members could learn the details of what amendments might be included in the eventual legislation.\n\nRepublicans could be voting on the most recent version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, an updated version of the bill that addresses the concerns of senators, a simple repeal of the Affordable Care Act or some combination of them.\n\nVice President Mike Pence spent about 30 minutes in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office in the Capitol Monday night. \"It's time to vote,\" Pence said as he left.\n\nThe meeting took place shortly after McConnell met with members of his leadership team and Sen.

Shelley Moore Capito who has been reluctant to support the Senate bill.\n\nThis time Trump put pressure on his Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, whom he said, perhaps in jest, that he needs to get the job done.\n\n\"By the way, you gonna get the votes?\" Trump asked Price, who was standing behind him. \"You better. Otherwise I'll say, 'Tom, you're fired!'\"\n\nHe added: \"You better get Sen. Capito to vote for it.\"\n\nCapito joined Trump behind stage at Monday night, but she\u2019s also weighing the 28 percent of West Virginians who are on Medicaid, one of the highest percentages in the country. The number of uninsured in the Mountaineer state could rise 299 percent, according to one study by the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, many because of reductions to Medicaid.\n\nThe quest for 50 votes is elusive, especially if McCain is unable to return. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, still appears to be solidly against the bill and so does Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., if there is no vote for a near-complete repeal of Obamacare. In an op-ed in The Hill on Monday, Paul harshly criticized the Senate process.\n\n\"'What bill?\u2019 Good question. Remember that when you hear the clamoring of voices saying 'you have to vote to proceed to the bill' or worse 'you just have to be part of the team and vote for it!'\" Paul wrote. \"That's the kind of thinking that got us into this mess and I won\u2019t be a part of it.'\"\n\nMore than a handful of other senators have also expressed deep reservations and have not come out and said they\u2019d support the motion to proceed.\n\nLeadership is pushing Republicans to vote \"yes\" on the motion to proceed, insisting that they will be able to offer any amendment that pertains to health care that they want. For example, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, can offer an amendment to reduce the cost of health insurance, Sen. Paul can offer an amendment to repeal Obamacare and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, can offer one to beef up Medicaid spending.\n\n\u201cI don't think anybody has determined what the exact sequence will be, but it's not like anybody is going to get any favorable treatment, everybody's going to get a chance to get a vote on everything they want to get a vote on.

FBI Special Agent Monte Czaplewski, writing in an affidavit attached to the criminal complaint, suggested that Wilson wanted to murder black people. The document suggests that he had weapons, as well as a National Socialist Movement (NSM) business card with him at the time he was arrested.\n\nWilson entered an engineer's seat of an Amtrak train after midnight on October 22 and started \"playing with the controls\" of the train, according to Czaplewski\u2019s account. No one was injured or killed in the attempted attack.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nNewsweek reached out to the NSM for a comment about the revelations but did not immediately receive a response. The group is neo-Nazi in nature, has ties to the more traditional American Nazi Party and has been connected to other elements of the modern, so-called alt-right movement at rallies and events.\n\nWilson traveled with that group to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August of last year, according to court documents. There, men chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d in the college city while marching with tiki torches on August 11, 2017. The following morning, fights broke out between white supremacist and antiracist counterprotesters. Later that day, a white man drove his car into a crowd of people, allegedly murdering Heather Heyer, an anti-racist activist.\n\nThe \u201calt-right,\u201d a deeply anti-Semitic movement that calls for limited immigration, mass deportations and a new state for white, non-Jews only, has been attached to many violent incidents since the Unite the Right event collapsed into chaos. William Edward Atchison, who killed two students at his high school last year, was a regular commenter on the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, according to The Daily Beast. Nicholas Giampa, a 17-year-old Virginia boy, allegedly murdered his girlfriend\u2019s parents, Scott Fricker and Buckley Kuhn Fricker, in a shooting incident that took place last month. He had a neo-Nazi social media presence, according to a report by The Huffington Post. The shooter who killed a Douglas County deputy and wounded other law enforcement figures on Sunday was attracted to an \u201calt-right\u201d ideology, according to a local news reporter.\n\nWilson, the accused terrorist, was not likely just a casual supporter of alt-right politics. Czaplewski noted in his affidavit that the man also had a photo of a banner broadcasting white supremacist propaganda on his phone.\n\nWithin the context of street-level politics, there is some bizarre irony to Wilson\u2019s arrest for attempting to commit terror on an Amtrak train. Figures loosely associated with the \u201calt-right\u201d movement attempted to blame \u201cAntifa,\u201d or anti-fascist demonstrators, for a fatal Amtrak train derailment that took place in Washington state in December.

Do you know how hard those are to find?\n\nYes, both of our actions sometimes result in property damage, but these Antifa jerk-offs are trying to prevent the very age of racial purity we aim to create. These clowns couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the Reichsadler and a bread-and-butter swastika. So the next time you\u2019re labeling a group of people as fascists, try to be a little more sensitive and give credit to the people who have earned that title.\n\n"}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/noam-chomsky-donald-trump-win-memories-hitler-nuremberg-rallies-a7469696.html": {"title": "Chomsky: Trump's win reminded me of listening to Hitler's rallies", "keywords": ["Noam Chomsky", " Donald Trump", " People", " News"], "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/noam-chomsky-donald-trump-win-memories-hitler-nuremberg-rallies-a7469696.html", "text": "Noam Chomsky has spoken of how watching the results come in on the night of Donald Trump's US election victory dredged up memories of his feelings after listening to Hitler's Nuremberg rallies as a boy.\n\nThe linguist was speaking during the 20th anniversary party for online news channel Democracy Now.

I\u2019ve never liked it because it felt clich\u00e9d and because I want to see intergenerational struggle better represented in fiction.\n\nToday I don\u2019t like that part of the story because\u2026 I don\u2019t feel ready.\n\nLast week, I lived in the same world as Ursula Le Guin, a grandmaster of science fiction who accepted awards by decrying capitalism and seemed, with every breath, to speak of the better worlds we can create. On Monday, January 22, 2018, she passed away. She was 88 years old and she knew it was coming, and of course my sorrow is for myself and my own loss and not for a woman who, after a lifetime of good work fighting for what she believed, died loved.\n\nIt\u2019s also a sorrow, though, to have lost one of the most brilliant anarchists the world has ever known. Especially now, as we start into the hard times she said were coming.\n\nTo be clear, Ursula Le Guin didn\u2019t, as I understand it, call herself an anarchist. I asked her about this. She told me that she didn\u2019t call herself an anarchist because she didn\u2019t feel that she deserved to\u2014she didn\u2019t do enough. I asked her if it was OK for us to call her one. She said she\u2019d be honored.\n\nUrsula, I promise you, the honor is ours.\n\nWhen I think about anarchist fiction, the first story that comes into my head is a simple one, called \u201cIle Forest,\u201d which appeared in Le Guin\u2019s 1976 collection Orsinian Tales. The narrative is framed by two men discussing the nature of crime and law. One suggests that some crimes are simply unforgivable. The other refutes it. Murder, surely, argues the one, that isn\u2019t for self-defense, is unforgivable.\n\nThe chief narrator of the story then goes on to relate a story of a murder\u2014a vile one, a misogynist one\u2014that leaves you with both discomfort and with the awareness that no, in that particular case, there would be no justice in seeking vengeance or legal repercussions against the murderer.\n\nIn a few thousand words, without even trying, she undermines the reader\u2019s faith in both codified legal systems and vigilante justice.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Le Guin carried her politics into her work. It\u2019s that the same spirit animated both her writing and her politics. In her 2015 blog post \u201cUtopiyin, Utopiyang\u201d she writes:\n\nThat\u2019s the anarchist spirit that animated her work. Anarchism, as I see it, is about seeking a better world while accepting impermanence and imperfection.\n\nI spend a lot of my time thinking about, reading about, and learning from others about how fiction can engage with politics. I don\u2019t want to put Le Guin on a pedestal\u2014she herself, in perfect form, refused to let people call her or her work genius\u2014but no one wrote political fiction with the same flair for well-told book-length metaphor as she did.\n\nThe easiest book for me to talk about is The Dispossessed, because it\u2019s the most widely-read anarchist utopian novel in the English language. When an anarchist like Le Guin writes her utopia, it\u2019s explicitly \u201can ambiguous utopia.\u201d It says so, right on the cover. It\u2019s the story of an anarchist scientist at odds with his own anarchist society and the stifling social conventions that can grow up in the place of laws. It\u2019s a story of that anarchist society, far from perfect, favorably compared to both capitalism and state communism. It\u2019s also a story about how beautiful monogamous relationships can be once they\u2019re not compulsory. When the anarcho-curious ask me for a novel to read that explores anarchism, I don\u2019t always suggest it, since the anarchist world represented is so bleak (my go to, more often that not, is Starhawk\u2019s The Fifth Sacred Thing). It\u2019s too anarchist of a text to serve as propaganda.\n\nLe Guin was also a pacifist. I\u2019m not one myself, but I respect her position on the matter. I think it was that pacifism that helped her write about violent anti-colonial struggle with as much nuance as she did in The Word for World is Forest. There\u2019s an inherent kindness in the violence in that book, which pits an indigenous alien race (the inspiration for the Ewoks of Star Wars, incidentally, in case you needed more proof that anarchists invent everything) against human invaders. The glory of struggle is muted, rendered realistically. The glory of it is as dangerous as the actual violence, as it should be.\n\nLe Guin and other authors blew open the doors of what science fiction could be, presenting social sciences as equal to hard sciences. Her novel The Left Hand of Darkness is about people who alternate between male and female. As I understand it, it was an unprecedented work when it came out in 1969. I didn\u2019t love it the way that I\u2019ve loved some of her other books, but I\u2019m not sure I can imagine what the world would look like if it had never been written. I can\u2019t point to another work that has done more to seed the idea that gender can and should be fluid. It\u2019s possible that my life as a non-binary trans woman would be completely different had she not written that book.\n\nThe Lathe of Heaven is psychedelic fiction at its finest and a parable of the power held by artists and those who imagine other worlds. Presciently, it explores a society destroyed by global warming.\n\nFor the luckier kids of my generation, Le Guin\u2019s fantasy series, Earthsea, filled the role that Harry Potter has for people younger than me. I wish I\u2019d read it as a kid, though I don\u2019t regret how often I read The Hobbit. In the world of Earthsea, the villains who threaten the world are aspects of the heroes who have to save it.\n\nThe words Le Guin has written that have meant the most to me, though, are her short stories. If you want to understand why so many people cried to hear of her death, read \u201cThe Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas.\u201d It is, simply, and I don\u2019t say this hyperbolically, perfect. It\u2019s short, and beautiful, and it\u2019s exactly the kind of story that can change the world.\n\nI haven\u2019t read all of Le Guin\u2019s books, and I have to admit, I\u2019m glad about that today. I\u2019m glad that there are more of her stories waiting for me.\n\nWhen I was a baby anarchist, I wanted to know what anarchism had to do with fiction. I get most of my ideas by talking to smart people, so I set out to ask smart people my question. I wrote Ursula Le Guin a letter and sent it to her PO Box. She emailed me back and I interviewed her for what I thought would be a zine.\n\nThat zine became my first book, which started what has since become both my career and, presumably, my life\u2019s work. She had literally nothing to gain by helping me, encouraging me, and lending her tremendous social credibility to my project. I like to think she was excited to talk explicitly about anarchism in a way she didn\u2019t often get to, but frankly I might be projecting my hopes onto her.\n\nI think of her kindness to me as an act of solidarity between two people fighting the same fight.\n\nThat\u2019s a big part of why I\u2019ve cried so much since her death.\n\nLater into that same book project, I started to ask myself why I cared so much why this or that author identified as an anarchist or worked for anarchist projects. I\u2019ve always been less concerned with the boundaries of our ideology and more interested in words and deeds that encourage freethinking, autonomous individuals who act cooperatively. Whether or not Le Guin calls herself (or lets us call her) an anarchist doesn\u2019t change what she\u2019s written or how she\u2019s impacted the world. Many of the best and most beneficial writers, activists, and friends I know or know of don\u2019t call themselves anarchists, and that doesn\u2019t change the love I have for them. I\u2019ve also never been particularly excited about celebrity culture, idol worship, or really just fame as a concept.\n\nYet it mattered to me\u2014still matters to me\u2014that Le Guin was an anarchist.\n\nI finally came to terms with why I care so much. I care because it means that those stories that have meant so much to me were written by someone with whom I\u2019m aligned on a lot of very specific hopes and dreams. I care because I can use her own words to eviscerate anyone who attempts to recuperate her into some other camp\u2014say, liberal capitalist or state communist\u2014and use her celebrity to promote causes she did not support or actively opposed. I care because the accomplishments of anarchists have been written out of history time and time again, and Le Guin is famous for some very specific and undeniable achievements that will be very hard to erase. Maybe it\u2019s hero worship. Maybe it\u2019s basking in reflected light. I don\u2019t know. I just know that she makes me proud to be an anarchist.\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of heroes. Most of my favorite writers, I aspire to be their peers. Ursula Le Guin was a hero. She mentored me without knowing it. She encouraged my writing both directly, by telling me she was excited for what I would write, and indirectly, by telling me why writing is worthwhile and also with her book on writing Steering the Craft.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m thinking about her words on the importance of words. As I step back from most organizing, I think about what she told me a decade ago:\n\nBut she knew that words alone weren\u2019t enough. Art is part of social change, but it isn\u2019t anywhere near the whole of it. Le Guin did thankless work, too, attending demonstrations and stuffing envelopes for whatever organization could use her help. It\u2019s that dichotomy that makes her my hero. I want everyone to leave me to my writing and not expect me to organize, but I want to be useful in other ways too.\n\nLast night, three of us exchanged Signal messages about her passing. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us now,\u201d we said. \u201cWe have to work harder without her now,\u201d we said. Signal messages are like whispers sometimes. In the dead of night, we say the things that scare us.\n\nI don\u2019t feel ready, but no one ever does. The truth is: we are ready. There are writers who remember freedom. Maybe more now than there have ever been. There are stories that need to be told, and we are telling them. Walidah Imarisha will tell them. Adrienne Marie Brown will tell them. Laurie Penny will tell them. Nisi Shawl will tell them. Cory Doctorow, Jules Bentley, Mimi Mondal, Lewis Shiner, Rebecca Campbell, Nick Mamatas, Evan Peterson, Alba Roja, Simon Jacobs, and more people than I can know or count will tell them.\n\nAll of us will tell them, to each other, by whatever means. We\u2019ll remember freedom. Maybe we\u2019ll even get there."}, "http://gawker.com/5953097/reddit-troll-michael-brutsch-defends-himself-on-cnn-i-treated-reddit-as-a-game": {"title": "Reddit Troll Michael Brutsch Defends Himself on CNN: &#39;I Treated Reddit As a Game&#39;", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://gawker.com/5953097/reddit-troll-michael-brutsch-defends-himself-on-cnn-i-treated-reddit-as-a-game", "text": "[There was a video here]\n\nThere wasn't much anyone following the story of 49-year-old Texas programmer Michael Brutsch, whom we revealed to be behind the notorious Reddit troll Violentacrez, could realistically have hoped to learn about the man from his appearance on Anderson Cooper's CNN show tonight. We already knew he is an unabashed creep who has now lost his job thanks to his predilection for posting pictures of underage girls in their underwear and spouting virulent racism on the social news site Reddit. There was a near-zero percent chance of some emotional breakdown or heartfelt confession that might make Brutsch seem to be sorry for anything but being caught. He'd put too much into Violentacrez over too many years for that.\n\nAnd when asked if he was sorry for his long career of trolling by CNN reporter Drew Griffin (who conducted the entire interview with a disgusted grimace on his face like he wished he were encased in a biohazard suit) Brutsch admitted he'd \"made mistakes,\" but offered this non-apology:\n\nI am to some degree apologizing for what I did. I was playing to an audience of college kids. Two years ago when all of this was at its height, the audience was appreciative and supportive of the sort of gallows humor that I put out there. Honestly the biggest thrill I got were those meaningless internet points.\n\nWhat was most remarkable about the interview was Brutsch's calm detachment as he offered insight into why he trolled. He explained that he thought of the subreddits he created, like Jailbait, the popular section dedicated to sharing borderline child porn, \"Chokabitch\" and \"picsofdeadbabies\" as \"folders\" where he stored images as he came across them on the internet. He created them with the sole purpose of enraging other users. \"I treated Reddit as a game,\" he said.\n\nThroughout the interview, Brutsch pinned much of the blame on the staff and community of Reddit, many of whose most prominent users have leapt vigorously to his defense. He said that Reddit \"encouraged and enabled this sort of behavior and I shouldn't have been apart of that.\" On one hand this is an obvious deflection tactic; Brutsch clearly delighted in every outrage. \"It had a reward,\" he said of his trolling. \"It's addictive.\" He has since admitted, on Reddit, that he has nobody to blame for what's happened to him except himself. On the other hand, Brutsch proudly showed Griffin a gold-plated Reddit Alien bobblehead he was given by Reddit \"for making significant contributions to the site.\" Reddit told CNN in a statement that it \"regrets having sent the trophy.\"\n\nBut now, Brutsch told CNN, his life is ruined. \"I anticipate it will get much worse.

The strike at the telecommunications giant is just one of the latest in a string of strikes by workers in the industry that have all pushed back against attacks on wages, health care, job outsourcing, and corporate globalization.\n\nDespite tough talk from both major capitalist parties and Trump in particular, since the economic meltdown of 2008, the only thing that has changed is that billions of dollars have moved out of the hands of poor and working-class people and into the hands of the billionaires\u2013who are now running the government.\n\nIn his first 100 days in office, Trump has slashed regulations, cut working and environmental standards, and pushed for massive tax cuts on the wealthy while slashing health care and medicaid for the poor and working class. Trump has done what politicians do best: placed the blame for the problems of society on refugees, immigrants, people of color, and activists, while rolling back gains that working people have made over the decades. Trump hasn\u2019t made America great again for anyone\u2013except the billionaire class. Despite all his right-wing rhetoric on \u201cglobalism,\u201d Trump has just continued the system of neoliberalism that has pushed austerity, outsourcing, and financialization\u2013all of which have attacked workers, the environment, and the poor.\n\nBut the recent strikes by telecommunications workers, like the historic Verizon strike that lasted 49 days, shows that some people aren\u2019t willing to keep taking it lying down. During the Verizon strike, workers fought back, both against scabs trying to break the strike and through the sabotage of company property. In the end, the Obama administration had to come in to break the strike and force the workers back to work.\n\nGoing out on strike must feel terrifying for some workers. Losing pay, being attacked in the media or by management, unsure as to what is going to happen. But whatever does go down, know that people struggling across the US support you.

But going ahead with the pipelines would mark a bitter defeat for Native American tribes and climate activists, who successfully blocked the projects earlier and vowed to fight the decisions through legal action.\n\nTrump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy production. Before taking office he said the Dakota pipeline should be completed and that he would revive the C$8 billion ($6.1 billion) Keystone XL project, which was rejected in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama.\n\nU.S. crude imports have fallen dramatically in recent years as domestic production has boomed, but the world\u2019s largest oil consumer still relies heavily on imports.\n\nEven though Canada is already the biggest source of U.S. crude imports, boosting the flow from a close ally is seen in Washington as a way to improve U.S. energy security.\n\n\u201cIt goes to show we as a nation build infrastructure that is part of a comprehensive energy plan to make our energy secure,\u201d Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told Reuters.\n\nTransCanada Corp said it would resubmit an application for a permit for Keystone XL after Trump signed an order saying the company could re-apply. The application will be reviewed by the U.S. State Department, which has 60 days to reach a decision.\n\nThe orders look set to undo victories won by protesters in North Dakota against Energy Transfer Partners, which has nearly completed construction of the Dakota line. Despite the advanced phase of the project, the Obama administration in December denied the company a permit to tunnel under the Missouri River.\n\nProtesters rallied for months against plans to route the $3.8 billion pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it threatened water resources and sacred Native American sites.\n\nAt one point, nearly 10,000 people had flocked to federal land in North Dakota, including 4,000 veterans after protests turned violent at times. The main protest camp has dwindled to several hundred after the Standing Rock tribe asked activists to leave when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Standing Rock Sioux said they would fight the orders.\n\n\u201cAmericans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream,\u201d said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock tribe.\n\nThe North Dakota Petroleum Council, the trade group for state oil producers relying on Dakota Access to expand their crude transport options, cheered Trump\u2019s order. About 1 million barrels a day are currently produced in North Dakota.\n\n\u201cWe think this is a great step forward for energy security in America,\u201d said Ron Ness, the council\u2019s president.\n\nThe more than 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline would bring heavy crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The project was conceived nearly a decade ago, but since then the U.S. shale revolution has redefined oil flows, with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports.\n\nCanadian Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said in Calgary that Keystone XL has all the regulatory approvals it needs in Canada, and that the project would be \u201cvery positive for Canada.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental activists campaigned against the Keystone XL pipeline for more than seven years, eventually winning a victory when Obama rejected the project in 2015.\n\nTrip Van Noppen, president of nonprofit environmental law organization Earthjustice, said in a statement that Trump \u201cappears to be ignoring the law, public sentiment and ethical considerations\u201d with the decision.\n\nTransCanada shares closed up 2.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday in Washington that Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs, but that figure is at odds with a 2014 U.S. State Department environmental study that said the project would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs.\n\nShares of ETP, the company building the 450,000 barrel-a-day Dakota pipeline, ended the day up 3.5 percent in U.S. trading.\n\nTrump owned ETP stock through at least mid-2016, according to financial disclosure forms, and ETP\u2019s chief executive, Kelcy Warren, donated $100,000 to his campaign.\n\nThe protest against the 1,172-mile (1,885 km) Dakota pipeline was concentrated around blocking a permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that forms part of the Missouri River, adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation.\n\nThe Army Corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further. Tuesday\u2019s White House memoranda said the Army and the Army Corps of Engineers should review and quickly approve permits for Dakota Access.\n\nIn Cannon Ball, North Dakota, protesters, many of whom have stayed at the camp for months, said they would continue fighting to protect the environment.\n\nAt a protest in front of the White House, a few hundred demonstrators shouted slogans and carried signs, including one that read: \u201cNow environmental rapist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened today is an attack on our homes,\u201d said Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, which fights against mining and dumping on native lands. \u201cWe are going to continue to show up at your home, Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, about 300 protesters gathered outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower, chanting slogans such as \u201cIf all lives matter, then Native lives matter\u201d and \u201cYou can\u2019t drink oil, even in the soil.\u201d\n\nActress and activist Jane Fonda, speaking to protesters with a bullhorn, called Trump \u201cthe predator in chief\u201d and warned of the danger of oil spills."}, "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/357549-milo-yiannopoulos-no-longer-appearing-at-phoenix-event-after-62": {"title": "Milo Yiannopoulos no longer attending Phoenix event after venues decline to host him", "keywords": ["Milo Yiannopoulos", "", ""], "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/357549-milo-yiannopoulos-no-longer-appearing-at-phoenix-event-after-62", "text": "Conservative provocateur and former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos will no longer attend a planned event in Phoenix after dozens of venues denied hosting the event.\n\nThe Phoenix New Times reported that the United Liberty Coalition, a Phoenix-based constitutionalist group, had reached out to \u201cat least 65\u201d venues to host the event, 62 of which declined.

Others, like 46-year-old Shawn Birdo, experience it and try to work their way out, John 3:16 Mission President Steve Whitaker said.\n\nBirdo was struck and killed by a vehicle in the early morning hours of Labor Day, according to Tulsa police, who on Tuesday announced the arrest of Jeremy Thacker, 40, for Birdo\u2019s killing and another injury crash Thacker was allegedly responsible for that occurred later that day.\n\nWhitaker said Birdo, who occasionally would stay at the John 3:16 Mission shelter downtown, was only outside the night of his death because his girlfriend didn\u2019t have a place to stay that night. They were struck under the I-244 bridge near 500 North Cheyenne Avenue, police said.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t leave her, and that cost him his life,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice identified Birdo\u2019s girlfriend as Cynthia Wallace, 49. Whitaker said he had been told Wallace\u2019s hip was broken in the assault.\n\nA third victim from that crash, identified by police as James Russell, was not seriously injured.\n\nWhitaker told The Frontier he didn\u2019t know Birdo well, but said John 3:16 Mission staff and residents described him as \u201ca nice, respectful\u201d person who often attended chapel there.\n\nWhitaker said he\u2019s seen the video of Birdo being struck by the white pickup allegedly driven by Thacker \u201cmore times than I care to have,\u201d and said the crime \u201creally displays the decay of the human heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, I worry about the loss of innocence (in the homeless community) from these attacks,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cLiving life as a homeless person is a dangerous lifestyle, but this is a whole different level.\u201d\n\nWhitaker said the location where Birdo and his girlfriend were struck Monday was well lit and was close to the shelter, which is patrolled by a security guard.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not safe there, under the bridge where the lights are on, well, we\u2019ve just gone down that path of disillusionment even further,\u201d he said.\n\nSandra Lewis, who runs the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless, said on Tuesday she was shocked at the \u201cblatant, hateful\u201d nature of the crime.\n\n\u201cIt just concerns me how blatant it was, to circle around and make sure you\u2019re lined up just so you can kill someone who is already struggling; it\u2019s awful,\u201d she said.\n\nLewis said the Day Center had coordinated with other shelters downtown to ensure no one would be turned away while the attacks were ongoing.\n\n\u201cWe announced that here and the people we were serving applauded, so there was a definite sense of \u2018Thank God we have some place to go,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAside from the attack on Birdo, Wallace, and Russell, Thacker is accused of using his vehicle to attack another person later that same day near the QuikTrip at 15th Street and Denver Avenue, police said. In that attack, police said, Thacker again jumped a curb and this time ran over a woman\u2019s legs as she was seated on the sidewalk.\n\nFollowing the initial crash that killed Birdo, Tulsa Police Sgt. Stephen Florea told the media there was \u201cno way\u201d the crash was an accident, setting the stage for a murder charge to be filed against Thacker.\n\nIn 2007, Thacker pleaded guilty to public intoxication and assault with a dangerous weapon after he pulled a knife on a convenience store clerk in north Tulsa and threatened to \u201cget you bitches.\u201d Court records show he was given a two-year suspended sentence that mandated some form of treatment at the Choctaw Nation Recovery Center.\n\nThacker changed the profile picture on his personal Facebook page twice following the Monday assaults \u2014 first posting one of himself in a black shirt and black hat, then another of himself in a grey shirt with a black hat. He also posted a meme from the Facebook Page \u201cOccupy Libtards\u201d about President Donald Trump donating money to Hurricane Harvey victims. In the image, Trump is Photoshopped to be giving the middle finger.\n\nThe meme states that Trump donated $1 million while others, such as Barack Obama, Whoopi Goldberg and Hillary Clinton donated nothing to the survivors.\n\nTulsa Police Department spokeswoman Jeannie MacKenzie said Tuesday that officers were still conducting a search warrant on the home where Thacker\u2019s pickup was spotted earlier in the day. She said he gave no statements to police during his arrest.\n\nShe said Thacker would be booked into jail on one complaint of first-degree murder and five complaints of assault with a deadly weapon."}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/black-man-prison-serve-five-years-ramad-chatman-georgia-prison-not-guilty-probation-broke-terms-jail-a7744326.html": {"title": "Black man will spend six years in US prison despite jury finding him 'not guilty'", "keywords": ["Prisons", " Georgia", " Americas", " World", " News"], "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/black-man-prison-serve-five-years-ramad-chatman-georgia-prison-not-guilty-probation-broke-terms-jail-a7744326.html", "text": "A black man who was found not guilty of armed robbery will still serve up to seven years behind bars after a judge ruled he had breached the rules of his probation sentence for another crime.\n\nRamad Chatman handed himself in to police when he found out he was a suspect for an armed robbery at a convenience store in his hometown of Georgia in July 2014.\n\n\"He turned himself in because he knew he was not guilty,\" his grandmother Janice Chatman told US news channel 11Alive.\n\nThe 24-year-old was already was serving a five year probation term (a court order served outside prison through fines and community service) for his first ever offence, breaking and entering an apartment to steal a television worth $120 (\u00a392) in 2012.\n\nHe was identified as a suspect for the armed robbery in the winter of 2014 after the shop assistant spotted his picture on Facebook. She identified him again when police showed her his driving licence picture.\n\nQuite why it took police so long to catch up with Chatman is unclear, but after hearing officers were looking for him, he turned himself in in November 2015.\n\nThe following February, a judge decided it was likely he did commit the robbery and as a result Chatman was re-sentenced for the original crime of stealing a TV and ordered to serve 10-years behind bars, back dated to the day of the crime.\n\nCourt documents nonetheless showed he did everything asked of him during his probation, including checking in, paying restitution and finishing his community service. He was also holding down a job.\n\nBut when the armed robbery trial came to court in August, he was found not guilty.\n\nIt later emerged that ahead of the trial Chapman tried to enter an Alford plea on the charge of aggravated assault in exchange for the armed robbery charges being dropped.\n\nAn Alford plea means the defendant enters a guilty plea, but maintains his innocence. It is often used when a defendant feels like despite his innocence, he will lose at trial.\n\nThe judge refused to accept the deal, so the case was heard before a jury - who ruled he was innocent of the crime.\n\nPresiding Judge John Niedrach, disagreed with their verdict however.\n\nSo despite the fact police never recovered the weapon, stolen money, or any other evidence connecting him to the robbery, he declined to release Mr Chatman, who remains in prison for violating the terms of his first probation order.\n\nMr Chatman\u2019s grandmother told 11 Alive he had worked hard to meet the terms of his court order, including paying his mandated fines on time.\n\n\u201cHe made sure he did right on his probation. He never violated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Judge Niedrach has done to my grandson is an injustice,\u201d she told the Rome News Tribune. \u201cWhen my grandson was proven not guilty, he should\u2019ve been let out.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, 38 percent of US prison inmates were black, despite only comprising 13 per cent of the general population, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nOne in six black men had been incarcerated in a US prison, as of 2001. If current trends continue, one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)."}, "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Torrance-Newspaper-Delivery-Women-Shot-During-Christopher-Dorner-Manhunt-Truck-LAPD-197241021.html": {"title": "No New Truck for Women Shot During Dorner Manhunt", "keywords": ["los angeles", " la news", " la breaking news", " breaking news in la", " la local news", " la", " news la", " news in la", " news", " latest news", " southern california", " nbc"], "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Torrance-Newspaper-Delivery-Women-Shot-During-Christopher-Dorner-Manhunt-Truck-LAPD-197241021.html", "text": "The two newspaper delivery women who were shot at during the manhunt for Christopher Dorner will not be getting a new replacement truck as promised by the LAPD, according to their attorney Glen Jonas.\n\nIt has been more than a month since LAPD Chief Charlie Beck promised the truck to Emma Hernandez, 71, and her daughter, Margie Carranza, who had been working in Torrance, Calif. before dawn on Feb. 7.\n\nUPDATE: City Attorney Vows to Help Get Compensation for Delivery Women\n\nPolice said it was a \"case of mistaken identity\" that prompted officers to open fire on the women. Beck later apologized and promised to replace their truck, now riddled with bullet holes.\n\nAccording to Jonas, LAPD and Galpin Ford wanted his clients to pose for a photo opportunity and pay income tax on the truck. The women no longer want the truck after they were told they needed to fill out a 1099 form for the donation, Jonas said Monday.\n\n\"You tried to murder the woman, now you're telling her she can't have a four-wheel drive, you're telling her she can't sell it and you've got to be taxed on it?\" Jonas said. \"How would anyone react to that?\"\n\nJonas plans on filing a government claim, which is a precursor to any lawsuit filed against a government agency. He said he felt the truck was being touted as a \"reward or prize\" instead of a sincere gesture by the LAPD.\n\nGalpin Ford estimates the value of the truck \u2013 a 2013 Ford 150 SuperCrew \u2013 at $32,560. The dealership had planned on paying the sales tax, vehicle registration and title on the truck, according to a dealership spokesperson.\n\n\"It's really sad for us because we want to help these women move on with their lives, and help them move forward with that, we just can't get past the 1099 issue,\" LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. \"The government has to take their bite out of it, I guess.\"\n\nThe women's Toyota Tacoma was pierced with 102 bullet holes from the Feb. 7 shooting, according to Jonas. Emma Hernandez is still recovering from two bullet wounds to her neck, which are giving her life-threatening complications, according to Jonas, who described what his clients went through that morning.\n\n\"The grandmother, Emma, starts saying, \u2018God have mercy on us,\u2019 because she thinks for sure they're going to die,\" Jonas said. \"She then clutches around the back seat of her daughter to protect her from the gun shots because her daughter has children.\"\n\nThe pair was driving a dark-colored pickup truck when they slowly approached the home of an officer named in ex-officer Christopher Dorner\u2019s angry manifesto. Apparently thinking Dorner was inside, police opened fire on the truck.\n\nAfter the shooting, Jonas said he was shocked by the officers\u2019 actions. He said neither the size of the women nor the blue Toyota Tundra truck they were in matched the description of Dorner's Nissan Titan.\n\nEight officers were involved in the shooting. They were assigned to non-field assignments \"until the (police) chief decides otherwise.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/obituaries/ursula-k-le-guin-acclaimed-for-her-fantasy-fiction-is-dead-at-88.html?smid=tw-nytobits&smtyp=cur": {"title": "Ursula K.

Their imagination has to be trained into foresight and empathy.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s \u201cpleasant duty,\u201d she said, is to ply the reader\u2019s imagination with \u201cthe best and purest nourishment that it can absorb.\u201d\n\nShe was born Ursula Kroeber in Berkeley, Calif., on Oct. 21, 1929, the youngest of four children and the only daughter of two anthropologists, Alfred L. Kroeber and Theodora Kracaw Kroeber. Her father was an expert on the Native Americans of California, and her mother wrote an acclaimed book, \u201cIshi in Two Worlds\u201d (1960), about the life and death of California\u2019s \u201clast wild Indian.\u201d\n\nAt a young age, Ms. Le Guin immersed herself in books about mythology, among them James Frazer\u2019s \u201cThe Golden Bough,\u201d classic fantasies like Lord Dunsany\u2019s \u201cA Dreamer\u2019s Tales,\u201d and the science-fiction magazines of the day. But in early adolescence she lost interest in science fiction, because, she recalled, the stories \u201cseemed to be all about hardware and soldiers: White men go forth and conquer the universe.\u201d\n\nShe graduated from Radcliffe College in 1951, earned a master\u2019s degree in romance literature of the Middle Ages and Renaissance from Columbia University in 1952, and won a Fulbright fellowship to study in Paris. There she met and married another Fulbright scholar, Charles Le Guin, who survives her.\n\nOn their return to the United States, she abandoned her graduate studies to raise a family; the Le Guins eventually settled in Portland, where Mr. Le Guin taught history at Portland State University.\n\nBesides her husband and son, Ms. Le Guin is survived by two daughters, Caroline and Elisabeth Le Guin; two brothers, Theodore and Clifton Kroeber; and four grandchildren.\n\nBy the early 1960s Ms. Le Guin had written five unpublished novels, mostly set in an imaginary Central European country called Orsinia. Eager to find a more welcoming market, she decided to try her hand at genre fiction.\n\nHer first science-fiction novel, \u201cRocannon\u2019s World,\u201d came out in 1966. Two years later she published \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea,\u201d the first in a series about a made-up world where the practice of magic is as precise as any science, and as morally ambiguous.\n\nThe first three Earthsea books \u2014 the other two were \u201cThe Tombs of Atuan\u201d (1971) and \u201cThe Farthest Shore\u201d (1972) \u2014 were written, at the request of her publisher, for young adults. But their grand scale and elevated style betray no trace of writing down to an audience.\n\nThe magic of Earthsea is language-driven: Wizards gain power over people and things by knowing their \u201ctrue names.\u201d Ms. Le Guin took this discipline seriously in naming her own characters. \u201cI must find the right name or I cannot get on with the story,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot write the story if the name is wrong.\u201d\n\nThe Earthsea series was clearly influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy. But instead of a holy war between Good and Evil, Ms. Le Guin\u2019s stories are organized around a search for \u201cbalance\u201d among competing forces \u2014 a concept she adapted from her lifelong study of Taoist texts.\n\nShe returned to Earthsea later in her career, extending and deepening the trilogy with books like \u201cTehanu\u201d (1990) and \u201cThe Other Wind\u201d (2001), written for a general audience.\n\n\u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness,\u201d published in 1969, takes place on a planet called Gethen, where people are neither male nor female but assume the attributes of either sex during brief periods of reproductive fervor. Speaking with an anthropological dispassion, Ms. Le Guin later referred to her novel as a \u201cthought experiment\u201d designed to explore the nature of human societies.\n\n\u201cI eliminated gender to find out what was left,\u201d she told The Guardian.\n\nBut there is nothing dispassionate about the relationship at the core of the book, between an androgynous native of Gethen and a human male from Earth. The book won the two major prizes in science fiction, the Hugo and Nebula awards, and is widely taught in secondary schools and colleges.\n\nMuch of Ms. Le Guin\u2019s science fiction has a common background: a loosely knit confederation of worlds known as the Ekumen. This was founded by an ancient people who seeded humans on habitable planets throughout the galaxy \u2014 including Gethen, Earth and the twin worlds of her most ambitious novel, \u201cThe Dispossessed,\u201d subtitled \u201cAn Ambiguous Utopia\u201d (1974).\n\nAs the subtitle implies, \u201cThe Dispossessed\u201d contrasts two forms of social organization: a messy but vibrant capitalist society, which oppresses its underclass, and a classless \u201cutopia\u201d (partly based on the ideas of the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin), which turns out to be oppressive in its own conformist way. Ms. Le Guin leaves it up to the reader to find a comfortable balance between the two.\n\n\u201cThe Lathe of Heaven\u201d (1971) offers a very different take on utopian ambitions. A man whose dreams can alter reality falls under the sway of a psychiatrist, who usurps this power to conjure his own vision of a perfect world, with unfortunate results.\n\n\u201cThe Lathe of Heaven\u201d was among the few books by Ms. Le Guin that have been adapted for film or television. There were two made-for-television versions, one on PBS in 1980 and the other on the A&E cable channel in 2002.\n\nAmong the other adaptations of her work were the 2006 Japanese animated feature \u201cTales From Earthsea\u201d and a 2004 mini-series on the Sci Fi channel, \u201cLegend of Earthsea.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of the 1980 \u201cLathe of Heaven,\u201d she had little good to say about any of them.\n\nMs. Le Guin always considered herself a feminist, even when genre conventions led her to center her books on male heroes. Her later works, like the additions to the Earthsea series and such Ekumen tales as \u201cFour Ways to Forgiveness\u201d (1995) and \u201cThe Telling\u201d (2000), are mostly told from a female point of view.\n\nIn some of her later books, she gave in to a tendency toward didacticism, as if she were losing patience with humanity for not learning the hard lessons \u2014 about the need for balance and compassion \u2014 that her best work so astutely embodies.\n\nAt the 2014 National Book Awards, Ms. Le Guin was given the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. She accepted the medal on behalf of her fellow writers of fantasy and science fiction, who, she said, had been \u201cexcluded from literature for so long\u201d while literary honors went to the \u201cso-called realists.\u201d\n\nShe also urged publishers and writers not to put too much emphasis on profits.\n\n\u201cI have had a long career and a good one,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHere at the end of it, I really don\u2019t want to watch American literature get sold down the river.\u201d"}, "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/lapd-cops-kill-homeless-man/": {"title": "Cops Turn Off Body Cams Before Killing 50yo Homeless Man, But A Citizen Filmed It", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/lapd-cops-kill-homeless-man/", "text": "Those were the tragically unprophetic words of the person who filmed Los Angeles cops gunning down a 50-year-old homeless man on Saturday, March 4.\n\nThe local ABC7 station reports that an altercation broke out at midday at an intersection in downtown LA, with two \u201cgentlemen, angry and antagonizing each other down the street,\u201d according to a nearby business owner.\n\nThe homeless man was carrying a large pipe, and someone called 911. Two LAPD cops showed up, and, according to police reports, tried to subdue the man with a Taser, although the video shows no evidence of that. Perhaps they attempted to tase him before the video started.\n\nAs the video begins, the people recording see it as a comical situation. Indeed, the homeless man appears to be physically unfit and not much of a threat to the armed officers.

She was arrested in May 2010 outside a US army base on the outskirts of Baghdad, having leaked hundreds of thousands of documents and videos downloaded from intelligence databases to WikiLeaks.\n\nThe US military confirmed that Manning was released on Wednesday morning.\n\nA couple of hours after her release, Manning said in a statement: \u201cAfter another anxious four months of waiting, the day has finally arrived. I am looking forward to so much! Whatever is ahead of me, is far more important than the past. I\u2019m figuring things out right now\u2013which is exciting, awkward, fun, and all new for me.\u201d\n\n\n\nManning\u2019s disclosures included Collateral Murder, the footage of a US Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad in which two Reuters journalists and other civilians were killed.\n\nHer seven-year ordeal has seen her held captive in Iraq, Kuwait and the US, always in male-only detention facilities. In that time, she has waged a relentless legal battle to be respected as a transgender woman, winning the right to receive hormone treatment but still being subjected to male-standard hair length and dress codes.\n\nBarack Obama granted Manning clemency in his final days in office in January. In commuting to time served her 35-year sentence \u2013 the longest ever penalty dished out in the US to an official leaker \u2013 the outgoing commander in chief said that \u201cjustice had been served\u201d.\n\n\n\nSpeaking from her prison cell as she prepared for release last week, Manning said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to breathing the warm spring air again.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want that indescribable feeling of connection with people and nature again, without razor wire or a visitation booth. I want to be able to hug my family and friends again. And swimming \u2013 I want to go swimming!\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s decision to release the soldier early leaves her with legal challenges still hanging over her. Foremost of those is the fact that her sentence from 2013 under the Espionage Act remains in full force \u00ad\u2013 a fact that her lawyers regard as ominous given the current incumbent of the White House.\n\nAs a result, even in freedom Manning will continue to press vigorously for her sentence to be overturned. Her appeal, filed almost exactly a year ago in the US army court of criminal appeals, argued that her 35-year sentence was \u201cperhaps the most unjust sentence in the history of the military justice system\u201d.\n\nManning\u2019s appeal lawyer, Nancy Hollander, told the Guardian: \u201cPeople keep assuming that just because someone is released their appeal is over. The rest of her case is still out there and we want to clear her name. She was convicted of crimes that I don\u2019t believe she committed and her whole prosecution was unfair.\u201d\n\nA fundraising drive drive to help Manning raise the legal fees needed to keep going with the appeal has been launched by Courage Foundation together with the German branch of Reporters Without Borders and the Wau Holland Foundation.\n\nManning\u2019s mother, Susan Manning, who is Welsh, told the Press Association that she was rejoicing at news of the release. \u201cI am so proud of Chelsea and delighted she will finally be free again.\u201d\n\nManning moved to Haverfordwest in Wales in 2001 when she was 14 to live with her mother, but returned to the US where she was born and brought up after school ended.\n\nSusan Manning said: \u201cIt is going to be very hard for her to readjust after so long inside the prison\u2019s four walls and I\u2019m happy she will be staying in Maryland where she has family to look out for her. Chelsea is so intelligent and talented, I hope she now has the chance to go to college to complete her studies, and to do and be whatever she wants. My message to Chelsea? Two words: \u2018Go, girl!\u2019\u201d\n\nThough Manning\u2019s release was greeted with a chorus of rejoicing on social media, one voice struck a more somber tone. David Coombs, the soldier\u2019s trial lawyer, put out a statement in which he said that the 35-year sentence handed down to the Army private amounted to a \u201cgrievous wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe day that Manning is released from prison should be a day of unadulterated joy for me,\u201d Coombs wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. It is a day that I am reflecting on how the military justice system could veer so far off course.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer added that \u201cthe particular constellation of players involved in this case, the desire to make an example out of Manning, and the \u2018win at all costs\u2019 mentality of the prosecution created a powder keg where the ability to achieve a just result was impossible. So I don\u2019t see Manning\u2019s commutation as a victory. I see it as an unfortunate failure of military justice to do its job.\u201d"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/11/police-killings-counted-harvard-study?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other": {"title": "US police killings undercounted by half, study using Guardian data finds", "keywords": ["US policing", "US news"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/11/police-killings-counted-harvard-study?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other", "text": "Over half of all police killings in 2015 were wrongly classified as not having been the result of interactions with officers, a new Harvard study based on Guardian data has found.\n\nThe finding is just the latest to show government databases seriously undercounting the number of people killed by police.\n\n\u201cRight now the data quality is bad and unacceptable,\u201d said lead researcher Justin Feldman. \u201cTo effectively address the problem of law enforcement-related deaths, the public needs better data about who is being killed, where, and under what circumstances.\u201d\n\nFeldman used data from the Guardian\u2019s 2015 investigation into police killings, The Counted, and compared it with data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). That dataset, which is kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was found to have misclassified 55.2% of all police killings, with the errors occurring disproportionately in low-income jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cAs with any public health outcome or exposure, the only way to understand the magnitude of the problem, and whether it is getting better or worse, requires that data be uniformly, validly, and reliably obtained throughout the US,\u201d said Nancy Krieger, professor of social epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the study. \u201cOur results show our country is falling short of accurately monitoring deaths due to law enforcement and work is needed to remedy this problem.\u201d\n\nNVSS data has been collected since the late 1800s and today is responsible for, among other things, aggregating all annual US deaths. In 1949, the report added a category to capture \u201clegal intervention\u201d as a cause of death along with classifications like cancer, heart disease and accidents. Typically these determinations are made by local medical examiners and coroners, reported on death certificates, and submitted to the CDC.\n\nTo assess how accurately that classification was being used, the team took the 1,146 police-related deaths recorded by The Counted in 2015, removed 60 cases that did not fit the criteria of the CDC\u2019s \u201clegal intervention\u201d category and requested death certificate data for the remaining 1,086 individuals. They found that a majority, 599 deaths, were classified as resulting from something other than legal intervention \u2013 principally \u201cassault\u201d.\n\nResearchers found the accuracy varied wildly by state, with just 17.6% misclassification in Washington, but a startling 100% in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201c[Oklahoma] had more than 30 people were killed by police there in 2015 and none of them were counted on death certificates,\u201d Feldman said.\n\nAccording to the report, there were 36 cases of \u201clegal intervention\u201d captured in the NVSS which were not included in The Counted.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this paper is a call to action to improve public health reporting, whether that\u2019s following a method like the Guardian did by integrating media sources better, or by changing the policy around requiring clinicians [medical examiners and coroners] to report these deaths,\u201d Feldman said.\n\nFeldman also noted that this problem was law-enforcement specific. \u201cEvidence suggests that the accuracy of mortality classification for homicide \u2013 an outcome similar to law-enforcement-related mortality \u2026 is very high\u201d, the report reads. One 2014 study cited puts the figure at 99%.\n\nIn 2015 the Guardian launched The Counted, an interactive, crowdsourced database attempting to track police killings throughout the US. The project was intended to help remedy the lack of reliable data on police killings, a lack that became especially visible after the 2014 unrest in Ferguson put policing in the national spotlight.\n\nOther federal databases, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 (BJS) arrest-related death count and the FBI\u2019s supplementary homicide reports were similarly criticised for severely undercounting police-related deaths. Both programs have been dramatically reworked since The Counted and similar media/open source databases forced officials such as the former FBI director James Comey to admit that newspapers had more accurate data than the government on police violence."}, "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yvette-felarca-neo-nazi-fascism_us_59949dece4b0d0d2cc83d266?1l": {"title": "Teacher Accused Of Punching Neo-Nazi Says Standing Up To Fascism Isn't A Crime", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yvette-felarca-neo-nazi-fascism_us_59949dece4b0d0d2cc83d266?1l", "text": "A middle school teacher in Berkeley, California, accused of punching a neo-Nazi during a 2016 protest is arguing that standing up to fascism is not a crime.\n\nYvette Felarca, 47, was arrested last month for her involvement in a June 2016 anti-fascist demonstration held in Sacramento.\n\nFelarca, who is a member of an activist group called By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), has been charged with felony assault, as well as two misdemeanor counts of inciting and participating in a riot, according to KPIX TV.\n\nFootage of the demonstration appears to show Felarca repeatedly punching a member of the Traditionalist Worker Party, a white nationalist group described as \u201da front for neo-Nazi sympathizers\u201d by ABC 10.

Jenny Rellick and Keith Rosenthal report on the case of one woman struggling to navigate these choices--and the terrible toll the system has taken on her.\n\nMILLIONS OF people living with mental illness are trapped by a system that labels them as disabled while providing few, if any, real resources to help them navigate these disabilities. As a result, large numbers are consigned to poverty, incarceration and an endless struggle to get the care they need and deserve.\n\nThis is the story of one such woman, whom we'll call \"Amy.\"\n\nAmy has a mental illness called schizoaffective disorder. In her case, this means she hears voices, is predisposed to delusions (false beliefs), has difficulty troubleshooting problems, and is predisposed to depression and mania.\n\nAmy is very high functioning compared to most with her disorder. \"I have a system of checks and balances I think through every day to help me figure out what's real and rational and what's a symptom,\" she says.\n\nDespite this, the system labels Amy as \"disabled,\" but provides almost no resources for treatment, housing or any other basic things that she and others need. In fact, the process of applying for state assistance and medical care itself puts Amy and millions like her in desperate circumstances. Recently, Amy was swept into one of the capitalist state's largest programs for disabled people--mass incarceration--because she had no money for medication.\n\nOFTEN, WHEN people in the U.S. dial 911 in the event of a mental health emergency, the first responders are police who use handcuffs and force--even deadly force. An immediate question that arises in the aftermath of these encounters is why are the police dispatched to these calls, instead of mental health professionals?\n\nThe answer goes beyond just a lack of resources or ignorance.\n\n\"Disablement\"--a term used to describe the act of being disabled in our society and how it is an institutional, not individual, issue shaped by a series of economic, political and ideological forces--is a major form of oppression under capitalism, like racism, sexism or homophobia. The criminalization of mental illness and other mental impairments is one aspect of this oppression.\n\nIt's worth understanding how disablement began and how it oppresses today--and recognizing that disability is socially constructed and not just a result of individual impairment.\n\nIn feudal times, people were \"blind,\" \"lame\" or \"deaf,\" but these different impairments were not considered subtypes of \"disability\" or \"impairment\" any more than we think \"valleys\" and \"canyons\" are subtypes of \"hollowness.\" People with various impairments worked to the extent possible, and they shared in the material sustenance of their family and community. Extended families cared for members with physical and mental impairments in their homes.\n\nAt the start of the Industrial Revolution, however, capitalists began to categorize people as unfit for work based on their physical and mental impairments. With industrialization, capitalists held individual workers to new and more exploitative standards of productivity and behavior. If an impairment caused, or was assumed to cause, individuals to fall short of these standards, they were fired or never hired at all. In this way, capitalism turned physical or mental impairments into \"disabilities,\" which are oppressive limitations imposed by society\n\nFrom the standpoint of the capitalist economic system as a whole, such marginalized disabled people form a significant part of the \"surplus population\" and the reserve army of the unemployed.\n\nThe capitalist class has long used the state--and in particular, the police--to regulate the lives of and even make such \"superfluous people\" disappear. At times, this has meant mass segregation in asylums, institutions, hospitals and nursing homes at the hands of the state.\n\nIn today's neoliberal America, where public funding for such institutions has been shredded, instead of going to the asylum or being cared for in the community, people with mental illness are instead frequently swept up in prisons and jails, and are incarcerated at much higher rates than the rest of the population. According to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 15 percent of men and 30 percent of women booked in jail--some 2 million people per year--have a serious mental illness.\n\nIN AMY'S case, she experienced disablement long before she was arrested.\n\nAmy has been able to hide her condition well enough to be hired and work a series of service-sector jobs, but these jobs did not offer health insurance. Without treatment, her symptoms would eventually worsen and she could not go to work. She has been hospitalized many times. She often felt hospital staff mistreated the other patients and her, emotionally and physically.\n\nAmy eventually got Medicaid as a result of a psychiatric hospitalization followed by intensive outpatient community mental health services. She wanted very much to manage her condition long-term, and hospitals are eager to help uninsured patients qualify for Medicaid because it's often their only hope for getting paid. Medicaid paid for Amy's outpatient medications, including high doses of Haldol, a cheap but strong, fast-acting antipsychotic drug.\n\nHospitals like to use Haldol to stabilize and discharge patients quickly. Amy continued to take Haldol through the community mental health center, and her doctor kept increasing her dosage as she grew tolerant.\n\nHaldol, however, is an antipsychotic drug that is known for severe side effects, including tardive dyskinesia--an irreversible involuntary movement disorder. Tardive dyskinesia causes facial tics and tongue thrusting, which often causes those already struggling with mental illness to face social isolation and rejection from strangers who don't understand that they are suffering from medication side effects.\n\nAmy worries because she started having facial tics before she turned 30. Her tardive dyskinesia is thus another aspect--in this case a state-induced one--of the oppression that is forced on her.\n\nThe community mental health center she attended encouraged Amy to apply for Social Security Disability (SSD). Amy uses her intellect to compensate for her impairment and does not present as mentally ill to most people. These traits, combined with the diligent use of her prescribed medication, meant that she did not appear \"sufficiently disabled\" in the eyes of her SSD interviewer. Like roughly 65 percent of SSD applicants, she was denied.\n\nAmy then hired a lawyer to help her appeal for SSD. She learned she would have to wait almost two years for her SSD appeal to be heard. Even if her claim was approved on appeal, however, her lawyer would receive 40 percent of the back-benefits owed to her.\n\nTo remain eligible for SSD, Amy had to stay below an income limit of $1,100 per month, and her lawyers advised her to stay well below it. The $1,100 limit may sound like plenty of money, but a studio apartment in her area costs $1,300 per month, according to BestPlaces.net. Amy lived with friends because she could not afford anything else.\n\nMeanwhile, Amy responded very well to treatment and was discharged from the outpatient community mental health program. She then could not find a community psychiatrist who would care for her at the Medicaid reimbursement rate, and Amy feared she would relapse. She ultimately got a psychiatrist through Catholic Charities, and he transitioned her antipsychotic drug from Haldol to Geodon, which carries a lower risk of side effects like tardive dyskinesia. Medicaid continued to pay for her prescriptions.\n\nAMY'S CASE illustrates how disablement or disability oppression can in some cases be worse for those with \"hidden\" disabilities. Because capitalists divide the poor into \"deserving\" and \"undeserving,\" people with hidden disabilities often are accused of feigning a disability or of being lazy.\n\nAmy's Medicaid coverage was based on being poor and disabled. (Had her state accepted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, poverty alone would have sufficed.) When Amy went for her annual Medicaid review, however, her denial for SSD and her discharge from the community mental health program called her status as a disabled person into question. \"You look like an able-bodied woman who could get a job,\" a social services worker told her.\n\nAmy was given a chance to show medical evidence of disability, and she did so. In a sick Catch-22, the \"problem\" was that her psychiatric treatment relieved her schizoaffective disorder so much that, according to the regulations, she could now hold down a job. Her Medicaid coverage was canceled. She was due to refill her prescriptions just a week after her Medicaid coverage ended.\n\nCatholic Charities continued to pay for Amy's psychiatrist, but they were not able to pay for her psychiatric drugs, totaling over $300 per month. Amy told the lawyers handling her SSD appeal about her predicament, and they advised her not to apply for jobs. Her SSD hearing was over a year away. Amy knew that without her medicines, her symptoms would return quickly and put her in danger.\n\nFriends helped pay for her medications the first month she was uninsured, but she grew ashamed to ask for help more than once. She was desperate to hold on to her sanity--and desperation can cause people to resort to desperate measures.\n\nAmy caught pneumonia, in part, she believes, as a result of the stress of her predicament. She was forced to get treatment without insurance. Amy decided that she had to make money through an off-the-books job to pay for her medication and pneumonia care.\n\nA marijuana seller had asked her to sell for him before, and she did not feel any moral reservations about selling pot because she believed it should be legal. Unfortunately, government officials in the state she lives in thinks marijuana is dangerous and that stopping its sale and use should be a priority.\n\nIn the middle of an opioid epidemic affecting millions and causing untold suffering, the police devoted resources to conducting marijuana sting operations.\n\nDespite its growing legality and the immense profits made from it for a small minority of people, those like Amy at the bottom of the marijuana industry are the most at risk for arrest and facing criminal penalties. In an effort to earn a lot of money quickly, Amy sold a felony quantity of marijuana to an undercover cop and a confidential informant.\n\nAmy does not blame anyone but herself for her arrest. But the worst aspect of disablement is that it is a widely unrecognized oppression that affects the course of disabled people's lives.\n\nThe terrible irony is that Social Security Disability regulations mandate that any pending cases be canceled when a person is incarcerated more than 30 days. Once an inmate is released, a new disability claim can be made, but the claim cannot date back to a time before the incarceration. Because Amy would spend a year in jail, her voluntary impoverishment at the behest of her lawyer was all for nothing.\n\nPart of the reason police, not mental health professionals, are dispatched to mental health emergencies is that the state's priority is to remove mentally ill people from the community. Like Amy, mentally ill people often cannot get the medication and care they need. They often live in poverty.\n\nThe capitalist state sets up mentally ill people for failure and desperation. At this low point, the state removes people from society. A hospitalization removes a person for three days, but an arrest removes the person much longer.\n\nIn a future article, we will share Amy's experience in jail and show how police and prisons inflict further the oppression of those with disabilities."}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/i-am-on-the-us-kill-list-this-is-what-it-feels-like-to-be-hunted-by-drones-a6980141.html": {"title": "'I am on the Kill List.

I am extraordinarily fortunate to be alive.\n\nI don\u2019t want to end up a \u201cBugsplat\u201d \u2013 the ugly word that is used for what remains of a human being after being blown up by a Hellfire missile fired from a Predator drone. More importantly, I don\u2019t want my family to become victims, or even to live with the droning engines overhead, knowing that at any moment they could be vaporized.\n\nI am in England this week because I decided that if Westerners wanted to kill me without bothering to come to speak with me first, perhaps I should come to speak to them instead. I\u2019ll tell my story so that you can judge for yourselves whether I am the kind of person you want to be murdered.\n\nI am from Waziristan, the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I am one of the leaders of the North Waziristan Peace Committee (NWPC), which is a body of local Maliks (or community leaders) that is devoted to trying to keep the peace in our region. We are sanctioned by the Pakistan government, and our main mission is to try to prevent violence between the local Taliban and the authorities.\n\nIn January 2010, I lent my vehicle to my nephew, Salimullah, to drive to Deegan for an oil change and to have one of the tires checked. Rumours had surfaced that drones were targeting particular vehicles, and tracking particular phone signals. The sky was clear and there were drones circling overhead.\n\nAs Salimullah conversed with the mechanic, a second vehicle pulled up next to mine. There were four men inside, just local chromite miners. A missile destroyed both vehicles, killed all four men, and seriously injured Salimullah, who spent the next 31 days in hospital.\n\nUpon reflection, because the drones target the vehicles of people they want to kill in Waziristan, I was worried that they were aiming for me.\n\nThe next attack came on 3 September 2010. That day, I was driving a red Toyota Hilux Surf SUV to a \u2018Jirga\u2019, a community meeting of elders. Another red vehicle, almost identical to mine, was some 40 meters behind. When we reached Khader Khel, a missile blew up the other vehicle, killing all four occupants. I sped away, with flames and debris in my rear view mirror.\n\nInitially I thought the vehicle behind was perhaps being used by militants, and I just happened to be nearby. But I learned later the casualties were four local laborers from the Mada Khel tribe, none of whom had any ties to militant groups. Now it seemed more likely that I was the target.\n\nThe third drone strike came on 6 October 2010. My friend Salim Khan invited me to dinner. I used my phone to call Salim to announce my arrival, and just before I got there a missile struck, instantly killing three people, including my cousin, Kaleem Ullah, a married man with children, and a mentally handicapped man. Again, none of the casualties were involved in extremism.\n\nNow I knew for certain it was me they were after.\n\nFive months later, on 27 March 2011, an American missile targeted a Jirga, where local Maliks \u2013 all friends and associates of mine \u2013 were working to resolve a local dispute and bring peace. Some 40 civilians died that day, all innocent, and some of them fellow members of the NWPC. I was early to the scene of this horror.\n\nLike others that day, I said some things I regret. I was angry, and I said we would get our revenge. But, in truth, how would we ever do such a thing? Our true frustration was that we \u2013 the elders of our villages \u2013 are now powerless to protect our people.\n\nI have been warned that Americans and their allies had me and others from the Peace Committee on their Kill List. I cannot name my sources, as they would find themselves targeted for trying to save my life. But it leaves me in no doubt that I am one of the hunted.\n\nI soon began to park any vehicle far from my destination, to avoid making it a target. My friends began to decline my invitations, afraid that dinner might be interrupted by a missile.\n\nI took to the habit of sleeping under the trees, well above my home, to avoid acting as a magnet of death for my whole family. But one night my youngest son, Hilal (then aged six), followed me out to the mountainside. He said that he, too, feared the droning engines at night. I tried to comfort him. I said that drones wouldn\u2019t target children, but Hilal refused to believe me. He said that missiles had often killed children. It was then that I knew that I could not let them go on living like this.\n\nI know the Americans think me an opponent of their drone wars. They are right; I am. Singling out people to assassinate, and killing nine of our innocent children for each person they target, is a crime of unspeakable proportions. Their policy is as foolish as it is criminal, as it radicalises the very people we are trying to calm down.\n\nI am aware that the Americans and their allies think the Peace Committee is a front, and that we are merely creating a safe space for the Pakistan Taliban. To this I say: you are wrong. You have never been to Waziristan, so how would you know?\n\nThe mantra that the West should not negotiate with \u201cterrorists\u201d is naive. There has hardly ever been a time when terrorists have been brought back into the fold of society without negotiation. Remember the IRA; once they tried to blow up your prime minister, and now they are in parliament. It is always better to talk than to kill.\n\nI have travelled half way across the world because I want to resolve this dispute the way you teach: by using the law and the courts, not guns and explosives.\n\nAsk me any question you wish, but judge me fairly \u2013 and please stop terrorizing my wife and children. And take me off that Kill List.\n\nMalik Jalal is represented by the charity Reprieve"}, "https://www.wnyc.org/story/ny-inmates-can-no-longer-receive-donated-books-they-have-purchase-them": {"title": "Inmates Can't Receive Donated Books Anymore, They Have to Buy Them", "keywords": ["npr", " new york", " WNYC", " arts", " culture", " news", " public", " radio"], "url": "https://www.wnyc.org/story/ny-inmates-can-no-longer-receive-donated-books-they-have-purchase-them", "text": "For a better experience, we recommend that you enable JavaScript.

After his time in jail he started blogging about the centralization of power by the European Union; ran as a candidate for the Finnish Pirate Party during the elections to the European Parliament; and founded Flattr, a micro donation system for software developers.\n\nI wanted to speak with Sunde about the current state of the free and open internet, but this conversation quickly changed into an ideological exchange about society and capitalism\u2014which is, according to Sunde, the real problem.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nMOTHERBOARD: Hey Peter, I was planning on asking you if things are going well, but you made it pretty clear that that isn't the case.\n\nPeter Sunde: No, I don't see any good happening. People are too easy to content with things.\n\nTake the net neutrality law in Europe. It's terrible, but people are happy and go like \"it could be worse.\" That is absolutely not the right attitude. Facebook brings the internet to Africa and poor countries, but they're only giving limited access to their own services and make money off of poor people. And getting government grants to do that, because they do PR well.\n\nFinland actually made internet access a human right a while back. That was a clever thing of Finland. But that's like the only positive thing I have seen in any country anywhere in the world regarding the internet\n\nSo, how bad is the state of the open internet?\n\nWell, we don't have an open internet. We haven't had an open internet for a long time. So, we can't really talk about the open internet because it does not exist anymore. The problem is, nobody stops anything. We are losing privileges and rights all of the time. We are not gaining anything anywhere. The trend is just going in one direction: a more closed and more controlled internet. That has a big impact on our society. Because they are the same thing today. If you have a more oppressed internet, you have a more oppressed society. So that's something we should focus on.\n\nBut still we think of the internet like this new kind Wild West place, and things are not in chains yet, so we don't care because everything will be OK anyhow. But that is not really the case. We have never seen this amount of centralization, extreme inequality, extreme capitalism in any system before. But according to the marketing done by people like Mark Zuckerberg and companies like Google, it's all to help with the open network and to spread democracy, and so on. At the same time, they are capitalistic monopolies. So it's like trusting the enemy to do the good deeds. It is really bizarre.\n\nDo you think because a lot of people don't consider the internet to be real or a real place, they care less about its well-being?\n\nWell, one thing is, we have been growing up with an understanding of the importance of things like a telephone line or television. So if we would start to treat our telephone lines or TV channels like we treat the internet, people would get really upset. If someone would tell you, you can't call a friend, you would understand then that this is a very bad thing that is happening. You understand your rights. But people don't have that with the internet. If someone would tell you, you can't use Skype for that and that, you don't get the feeling it's about you personally. Just by being a virtual thing, it's suddenly not directed at you. You don't see someone spying on you, you don't see something censored, you don't see it when someone deletes stuff out of the search results out of Google. I think that's the biggest problem to get people's attention. You don't see the problems, so people don't feel connected to it.\n\nI would rather not care about it myself. Because it's very hard to do something about it, and not become a paranoid conspiracy person. And you don't want to be that. So rather just give up. That's kind of what people have been thinking, I think.\n\nWhat is it exactly that you have given up?\n\nWell, I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet.\n\nThe situation is not going to be any different, because apparently that is something people are not interested in fixing. Or we can't get people to care enough. Maybe it's a mixture, but this is kind of the situation we are in, so its useless to do anything about it.\n\nWe have become somehow the Black Knight from Monty Python's Holy Grail. We have maybe half of our head left and we are still fighting, we still think we have a chance of winning this battle.\n\nSo what can people do to change this?\n\nNo, I think we are at that point. I think it's really important people understand this. We lost this fight. Just admit defeat and make sure next time you understand why you lost this fight and make sure it doesn't happen again when we try and win the war.\n\nRight, so what is this war about and what should we do to win it?\n\nWell, I think, to win the war, we first of need to understand what the fight is and for me it's clear that we are dealing with ideological thing: extreme capitalism that's ruling, extreme lobbying that's ruling and the centralization of power. The internet is just a part of a bigger puzzle.\n\nAnd the other thing with activism is that you have to get momentum and attention and such. We have been really bad at that. So we stopped ACTA, but then it just came back with a different name. By that time, we had used all our resources and public attention on that.\n\nThe reason that the real world is the big target for me, is because the internet is emulating the real world. We are trying to recreate this capitalistic society we have on top of the internet. So the internet has been mostly fuel on the capitalistic fire, by kind of pretending to be something which will connect the whole world, but actually having a capitalistic agenda.\n\nLook at all the biggest companies in the world, they are all based on the internet. Look at what they are selling: nothing. Facebook has no product. Airbnb, the biggest hotel chain in the world, has no hotels. Uber, the biggest taxi company in the world, has no taxis whatsoever.\n\n\"I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet.\"\n\n\n\nThe amount of employees in these companies are smaller than ever before and the profits are, in turn, larger. Apple and Google are passing oil companies by far. Minecraft got sold for $2.6 billion and WhatsApp for like $19 billion. These are insane amounts of money for nothing. That is why the internet and capitalism are so in love with each other.\n\nYou told me the internet is broken, that it was always broken. What do you mean by that and do we have extreme capitalism to blame for it?\n\nWell, the thing is the internet is really stupid. It works really simply in a simple manner and it doesn't take any adjustments for censorship. Like, if one cable is gone, you take the traffic through some other place. But thanks to the centralization of the internet, (possible) censorship or surveillance tech is a whole lot harder to get around. Also, because the internet was an American invention, they also still have control of it and ICANN can actually force any country top level domain to be censored or disconnected. For me that's, a really broken design.\n\nBut it has always been broken, we just never really cared about it, because there always have been a few good people that made sure that nothing bad happened before. But I think that's the wrong idea. Rather let bad thing happen as quick as possible so we can fix them and make sure it does not happen in the future. We are prolonging this inevitable total failure, which is not helping us at all.\n\nSo, we should just let it crash and burn down, pick up the pieces and start over?\n\nYes, with the focus on the big war on this extreme capitalism. I couldn't vote, but I was hoping Sarah Palin won last time in the US elections. I'm hoping Donald Trump wins this year's election. For the reason that it will fuck up that country so much faster then if a less bad President wins. Our whole world is just so focused on money, money, money. That's the biggest problem. That's why everything fucks up. That's the target we have to fix. We need to make sure that we are going to get a different focus in life.\n\n\"We don't have an open internet. We haven't had an open internet for a long time.\"\n\n\n\nHopefully technology will give us robots that will take away all the jobs, which will cause like a massive worldwide unemployment; somewhat like 60 percent. People will be so unhappy. That would be great, because then you can finally see capitalism crashing so hard. There is going to be a lot of fear, lost blood, and lost lives to get to that point, but I think that's the only positive thing I see, that we are going to have a total system collapse in the future. Hopefully as quick as possible. I would rather be 50 then be like 85 when the system is crashing.\n\nThis all sounds quite like some sort of Marxist revolution: a total crash of the capitalist system.\n\nWell, yeah, I totally agree with that. I'm a socialist. I know Marx and communism did not work before, but I think in the future you have the possibility of having total communism and equal access to everything for everybody. Most people I meet, no matter if they are a communist or a capitalist, agree with me on this, because they understand the potential.\n\nSo, is there like a concrete thing we should focus on? Or do we need to aim for a new way of thinking? A new ideology?\n\nWell, I think the focus needs to be that the internet is exactly the same as society. People might realize that it's not a really good idea to have all of our data and files on Google, Facebook and company servers. All of these things need to be communicated al the way to the political top, of course. But stop treating internet like it's a different thing and start focusing on what you actually want your society to look like. We have to fix society, before we can fix the internet. That's the only thing."}, "http://www.rawstory.com/2016/02/utah-man-dies-in-police-custody-after-being-jailed-for-2400-unpaid-medical-bill": {"title": "Utah man dies in police custody after being jailed for $2,400 unpaid medical bill", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.rawstory.com/2016/02/utah-man-dies-in-police-custody-after-being-jailed-for-2400-unpaid-medical-bill", "text": "Rex Iverson was put in the Box Elder County Jail when he didn\u2019t pay an ambulance bill.

Manning, the transgender former Army private who was convicted of passing sensitive government documents to WikiLeaks, is seeking to run for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, according to federal election filings.\n\nManning would be challenging Democrat Benjamin L. Cardin, who is in his second term in the Senate and is up for reelection in November. Cardin is Maryland's senior senator and is considered an overwhelming favorite to win a third term.\n\nManning declined to speak about her filing or to say why she might be running when reached at her home in Bethesda on Saturday.\n\nShe said she might release a statement in the coming days.\n\n\"Our only statement on the record is 'No statement,' \" Manning said.\n\nManning, 30, was convicted in 2013 of the largest leak of classified documents in U.S. history and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Last year, as President Barack Obama was nearing the end of his term in office, he commuted Manning's sentence to time served, and she was released from a military prison in Kansas.\n\nThe news of Manning's filing caught Maryland's political class by surprise Saturday afternoon. It was first reported in a tweet by the conservative media outlet Red Maryland.\n\nCardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has an extensive fundraising base in Maryland and is not considered particularly vulnerable to a challenge from any known figures within the state. However, a candidate with national name recognition, such as Manning, who comes in from the outside could tap a network of donors interested in elevating a progressive agenda.\n\nWithout mentioning Manning, Sue Walitsky, Cardin's spokeswoman, said: \"Senator Cardin is looking forward to a vigorous debate of the issues and a robust conversation with Maryland voters.\"\n\nManning would also have to file with the Maryland State Board of Elections to get her name on the ballot.\n\nManning moved to Maryland after her release from prison. Since then, she has written for the Guardian and Medium on issues of transparency, free speech and civil liberties, transgender rights and computer security, according to her website.\n\nManning's statement of candidacy was filed with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday.\n\nShe is running as a Democrat and refers to Maryland as her \"home state\" on her website. The Democratic primary is scheduled for the end of June.\n\nManning's first column for the Guardian said Obama's election in 2008 was a political awakening for her.\n\nManning wrote that Obama left behind \"hints of a progressive legacy\" but very few permanent accomplishments.\n\n\"This vulnerable legacy should remind us that what we really need is a strong and unapologetic progressive to lead us,\" Manning wrote. \"What we need as well is a relentless grassroots movement to hold that leadership accountable.\"\n\nEvan Greer, campaign director of the nonprofit organization Fight for the Future and a close supporter of Manning's while she was imprisoned, said the news is exciting.\n\n\"Chelsea Manning has fought for freedom and sacrificed for it in ways that few others have,\" Greer wrote in an email. \"The world is a better place with her as a free woman, and this latest news makes it clear she is only beginning to make her mark on it.\"\n\nTodd Eberly, a political-science professor at St. Mary's College in Maryland, said Donald Trump's unexpected rise to the presidency opened the door for political neophytes such as Manning.\n\n\"My initial thought quite literally was, 'Donald Trump is president, Oprah Winfrey is the leading contender for Democrats in 2020, why the hell not Chelsea Manning in the U.S. Senate?' \" he said.\n\nJudging from her past statements, Manning's brand could be one of \"unapologetic progressivism, no compromise, take no prisoners,\" he said.\n\nManning enlisted in the military in 2007 and was deployed to Iraq two years later as an intelligence analyst, according to her website.\n\nIn 2010, Manning was arrested after she provided a trove of nearly 750,000 documents to WikiLeaks that included information about the U.S. war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables and information about prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nManning's high-profile leak drew media coverage around the world. U.S. officials said the material placed the lives of U.S. soldiers and Afghan informants at risk, but Manning said she had a duty to inform the public about how the United States was conducting its wars.\n\nThree years later, Manning was convicted on multiple charges, including violating the Espionage Act, and received a lengthy sentence. While serving time at Fort Leavenworth, Manning attempted suicide and went on a hunger strike, before the Army approved her for gender reassignment surgery.\n\nHer case remains politically divisive. She has been lauded as a hero by some on the left but also decried as a traitor by many, including President Trump.\n\nHer felony convictions do not appear to bar her from running for the Senate. The Constitution simply requires that a senator be at least 30 years old, have been a citizen of the United States for nine years and be a resident of the state from which the person is seeking office.\n\nJenna Portnoy covers Virginia, Maryland and D.C. politics for The Washington Post.

A CIA strike on a madrassa or religious school in 2006 killed up to 69 children, among 80 civilians.\n\nThe attack was on a religious seminary in Chenegai, in Bajaur Agency.\n\nCIA drones attacked on October 30, flattening much of the school. Their target was reportedly the headmaster, a known militant. According to some reports, there was also a token late contribution to the assault by Pakistani military helicopters. But dozens of children were also killed, the youngest aged seven.\n\nVeteran journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, speaking to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism from Peshawar, recalls visiting the village just after the strike: \u201cPeople were devastated. I met with a father who had lost two children. He was very patient, talking of how God must have willed this, but he was clearly traumatised.\u201d\n\nInitially the Pakistan Army claimed that it had carried out the bombardment, even as shops and offices closed across the region and protests spread.

It's pretty easy to see why.\n\nFausset spends much of the profile \"humanizing\" Hovater and his wife, presenting them as a perfectly normal couple...except, oh yeah, for the fact that Hovater's a Hitler-loving neo-Nazi who in 2015 co-founded the Traditionalist Worker Party.\n\nMembers of this fascist organization have repeatedly engaged in violence and provocative actions, including during the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where numerous anti-racist activists were injured and Heather Heyer was killed earlier this year.\n\nLines from the Times piece--like \"Weddings are hard enough to plan for when your fianc\u00e9 is not an avowed white nationalist\"--along with references to Hovater's cats, his wedding registry and his \"polite and low-key\" demeanor angered many readers.\n\nFausset wrote that Hovater is a big Seinfeld fan who supposedly \"prefers to spread the gospel of white nationalism with satire.\" The article compares his embrace of fascism to a \"hipster's\" love of heavy metal and remarks on Hovater's \"Midwestern manners\" that would \"please anyone's mother\" (as long as your mother isn't Jewish or Black or any other group targeted by Hovater and his neo-Nazi buddies).\n\nAFTER THE outcry that greeted the story, the New York Times took the unusual step of having its National Editor Marc Lacey as well as the reporter Fausset respond in print. The Times also removed a link in the original story to swastika armbands for sale on the Traditionalist Worker Party website.\n\nLacey and Fausset \"regretted\" that the story offended so many people--but said that, especially after the violence in Charlottesville, the issue of the growth of the far right in America is a complex one, with no simple answers.\n\n\"Sometimes all we can bring you is the words of the police spokesman, the suspect's picture from a high school yearbook, the acrid stench of the burned woods,\" Fausset noted in poetic prose--while misusing a reference to a song by the punk band the Minutemen. \"Sometimes a soul, and its shape, remain obscure to both writer and reader.\"\n\nExcept there's not a lot that's \"obscure\" about the Traditionalist Worker Party--whose stock-in-trade is scapegoating Jews, minorities, liberals and anti-racists.\n\nIts members are open admirers of Hitler. In Hovater's case, he claims the Holocaust was \"overblown.\" Proof? None--Hovater simply claims in the Times profile that \"Heinrich Himmler wanted to exterminate groups like Slavs and homosexuals, [while] Hitler 'was a lot more kind of chill on those subjects.'\" The murder of 6 million Jews doesn't come up.\n\nHovater never comes out and says he's for gassing Jews or lynching Blacks. He just claims that it's common sense that white people are suffering because Blacks and other minorities receive special treatment and Jews control the media and financial system.\n\nFausset writes that Hovater is \"adamant that the races are probably better off separated, but he insists he is not racist.\" Neither he nor his editor bother to ask how both things can be true. In fact, the Times profile is striking for how derelict it is in compelling Hovater to answer any serious follow-up questions or even noting where he ducks them.\n\nFAUSSET NOTES that Hovater was on the scene during the far right's rampage in Charlottesville in August, but he never talks to anyone who witnessed the deadly violence of the Traditionalist Worker Party and their neo-Nazi brethren.\n\nMembers of the group have not been shy about their role. After the killing of Heather Heyer, Matt Parrot, a member of the affiliated Traditionalist Youth Network, proudly talked about how the group helped escalate the violence at the city's Emancipation Park: \"With a full-throated rebel yell, the League [of the South] broke through the wall of degenerates [anti-racist protesters] and TradWorker managed to enter the Lee Park venue itself while they were largely still reeling.\"\n\nMatthew Heimbach, another co-founder of the party, is also quoted in the profile of Hovater about the need for the group to recruit \"more families. We need to be able to just be normal.\"\n\nHeimbach was also in Charlottesville, where, dressed in a black shirt and German-style military helmet, he repeatedly urged the group's supporters to push through the ranks of the anti-racists.\n\nAfter Heyer's death, Heimbach told the New York Times that the day was a rousing success: \"We achieved all of our objectives...We asserted ourselves as the voice of white America.\" Fausset noted that, on social media, Hovater's takaway from Charlottesville was similar: \"We made history. Hail victory.\"\n\n\"Our reporter and his editors agonized over the tone and content of the article,\" Times editor Marc Lacey wrote in his defense of the piece. But they didn't agonize the way Heather Heyer's mother has.\n\nOn the same day that Heyer was killed, an African American protester named DeAndre Harris was brutally beaten in a parking garage by a mob of white supremacists, leaving him with a spinal injury and a head laceration that required 10 stitches. Video of the attack showed at least one man, Jacob Scott Goodwin, was wearing a Traditionalist Worker Party pin.\n\nIt's a safe bet that DeAndre Harris has a different view of the Hovater's \"Midwestern manners.\"\n\nIN ONE especially thorough takedown of the profile of Hovater that circulated online, one commenter pointed out how the Times gave \"a racist an unchallenged platform,\" while failing to talk to civil rights organizations or even ask follow-up questions, like about the ideology of the Traditionalist Worker Party.\n\nEven a cursory Internet search would have turned up reams of information about the party, its Holocaust denial and connections to other neo-fascist groups and the violence and bigotry of its leading figures.\n\nThus, the Times didn't see fit to mention that Heimbach advocates an America in which homosexuality and interracial marriage are illegal. Those who are gay or in favor of interracial marriage should be sent to re-education camps, he has said. \"In any healthy society [gays] would be dragged off to therapy to help you cope with your mental illness, not given glitter and assless chaps to parade down the street.\"\n\nThe group uses language calculated to appeal to the political polarization in the U.S. and economically struggling white workers in particular. This includes ostensibly anti-capitalist and pro-environment rhetoric.\n\nWhile the Times noted that the party is attempting to recruit on campuses, it didn't say what that means. How do the students at Murray State University feel, for example, after the Traditionalist Worker Party reserved a table in September and posted flyers that talked about \"fighting to take back our communities\"?\n\nAnd what about the multiracial residents of Sacramento, where last year some 30 members of the Traditionalist Worker Party engaged in a violent confrontation with anti-fascist counterprotesters that left 10 people injured, some seriously? After the violence, one neo-Nazi bragged that anti-fascists \"got one of our[s] but we got six of theirs.\"\n\nDESPITE CLAIMING to seek an understanding of Hovater's motives, the Times article doesn't attempt to show the impact of a fascist group on the people who suffer real abuse and injury as a result of its organizing.\n\nNot DeAndre Harris, injured in Charlottesville; not the members of Congregation Beth Israel, the city's sole synagogue, who were forced to flee when the neo-Nazis marched in front, chanting \"Sieg heil\" (\"Hail victory\"); not the many more people beyond Charlottsville who today feel unsafe on their campuses and in their communities because of the Traditionalist Worker Party.\n\nPresenting a Nazi as the mild-mannered \"boy next door\" who cares deeply about his community is nothing new. Racism is American as apple pie in a country built on the enslavement of Blacks, and the attempt by white supremacists to normalize their hate is a longstanding tradition of America's far right.\n\nParticularly in its modern incarnation, the Klan has mixed racist terrorism with more benign activities in an attempt to gain a larger foothold in political and social life. David Duke, a former Grand Dragon of the KKK in Louisiana, built a political career on trying to get the Klan \"out of the cow pasture and into the hotel meeting rooms.\"\n\nAfter Charlottesville, a series of anti-racist mobilizations against planned far-right rallies from Boston to Berkeley, California, helped drain some of the wind from the sails of the fascists. Even so, they have been given a boost by the current occupant of the White House who, as Matthew Heimbach noted back in 2015, \"is blowing the dog whistle for white racial interests harder than any other candidate.\"\n\nJust last week, Trump re-tweeted false and virulently racist and Islamophobic videos from a far-right group, Britain First--an action that various administration officials then defended.\n\nWith this kind of racist \"fake news\" being circulated by the current occupant of the White House, it puts a premium on journalists doing a better job of exposing the far right--and on all of us building opposition in our workplaces, campuses and communities."}, "https://socialistworker.org/2009/11/25/day-to-give-thanks": {"title": "A day to give thanks?", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://socialistworker.org/2009/11/25/day-to-give-thanks", "text": "Paul D'Amato tells the real story of the \"first Thanksgiving\"--and the history of conquest and resistance that followed after it.\n\nTHE THANKSGIVING myth is intertwined with this country's origin myth.\n\nPuritans fleeing religious persecution in England landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620 in search of freedom. Indians helped them plant corn and survive. They made a compact that is the basis of our first constitution, and they held a feast, together with some Indians, to celebrate and give thanks to God for their first bounteous harvest.\n\nThe story has elements of truth, but not much more than elements. What children learn is the overarching message--that Pilgrims were everything good about America: European, Christian, sober, democratic, generous, God-fearing, and so on and so forth.\n\nTrue, an Indian named Squanto did teach the Pilgrims how to plant corn and saved the invaders from total starvation. What we aren't told is that Squanto learned English because he had been abducted and made a slave in Europe some years before, and the place where he taught the new settlers to plant corn was the village he had grown up in, Patuxet, now depopulated by the impact of European diseases.\n\nThe colonists planted their first crops in an abandoned field cleared by Indians, and found the area strewn with the bleached bones of dead Indians, which the surviving ones, having fled elsewhere, were unable to bury.\n\nThere are other problems with the story. The Pilgrims' relations with the first Indians they encountered were not initially friendly; short of provisions, the Pilgrims stole corn from a granary of the Nauset Indians, and later robbed a grave and some Indian houses they stumbled across.\n\nWhat has in hindsight been described as the \"first\" Thanksgiving was a typical English harvest feast. It took place almost a year into the existence of the settlement, whose numbers had dwindled by half because of disease and starvation to only 50 people. According to the account of William Bradford, 90 Indians, led by Massassoit, the Wampanoag chief or Sachem, attended the feast, bringing five deer with them.\n\nIn all the Thanksgiving stories and plays, the Indians are really a kind of sideshow to the Pilgrim \"fathers\"--even though all the foods were Indian foods; the Indians outnumbered the Pilgrims; and without the Indians, the Pilgrims would not have survived. Yet the thanks are never to the Indians, but to God, to the Pilgrims themselves--anything but to Native Americans.\n\nTHIS IMAGE of Indians as props for the occasion still persists. It reflects a not uncommon view of the \"New World,\" peddled from the beginning by Europeans who aimed to conquer and settle it--that it was a sparsely populated place, inhabited by nomadic people.\n\nCapt. John Smith, who had helped settle Jamestown in 1609, argued that Englishmen could rightfully seize Indian land because God intended land to be cultivated, and this land was \"unmanned wild country\" that Indians \"range rather than inhabit.\" (Did the Zionist leaders who founded Israel read Smith?)\n\nThe truth was very different. On the Eastern seaboard, Indians did \"tame\" the land. They grew three types of corn, with at least two growing seasons, as well as squash and beans, and they supplemented their diet with fish, shellfish, deer and birds. They cleared land not only for farming, but also set controlled brush fires in forests in order to create better hunting conditions. They made extensive systems of trails and roads for trade and travel, and more. The English settlers found wooded areas that looked like parks and large open fields that reminded them of home.\n\nIn New England, what may have been bubonic plague, brought to coastal Maine a few years before the arrival of the Mayflower, had reduced Massasoit's Pokanokets from 12,000 people, with 3,000 warriors, to a tribe able to deploy only a few hundred fighters. Indeed, the reason Massasoit was so friendly to the Pilgrims was because he felt too weak to fend off his rivals, the larger Naragansetts, and hoped to form an alliance with the newcomers to strengthen his position.\n\nThe myth also obscures the purpose of the colony. While it was true that some of the Mayflower passengers were English Puritans attempting to find a place to practice their religion without persecution, more than half of the colonists were not Puritans. Moreover, in order to be able to travel to this \"New World,\" the colonists had to secure the backing of a joint-stock company whose investors expected a return on their investment.\n\nPlymouth was both a profit-making venture and an outpost of English imperialism. There had been a spate of colonizing efforts by England in the region, in competition with other European powers Spain, France and Holland. England, like its competitors, aimed to claim this \"New World\" and its riches by any means necessary, including the outright extermination of entire peoples.\n\nThe historian Francis Jennings outlines the policy adopted by English conquerors that had already been established in Ireland:\n\nListen to this Jamestown colonist, writing after the Powhatans had risen to drive out the English settlers in 1622:\n\nThe Indians were not prepared for the level of savagery meted out against them.\n\nIn 1621, the Plymouth colonies' military commander, Captain Miles Standish, ambushed and massacred a group of eight Massachusetts Indians north of Plymouth in order to set an example to those who might consider challenging the Plymouth settlement. \"This sudden and unexpected execution,\" wrote colonist Edward Winslow, \"hath so terrified and amazed them...they forsook their houses...living in swamps...and so brought manifold diseases amongst themselves, whereof very many are dead.\"\n\nAfter this incident, the invaders acquired a new name among the indigenous people: \"Wotowquenange,\" meaning stabbers or cutthroats.\n\nIT SHOULD be clear, then, that the first Thanksgiving was not the end of the story. The Indians very quickly discovered they had little to celebrate.\n\nAs the European settlements grew and began to outnumber the Indians, the invaders became more arrogant, more land-hungry and more powerful. The increasing encroachment on Indian lands built to a tension that eventually provoked some Indians into decisive and desperate action.\n\nSome 64 years after the colonists feasted with Massassoit, in 1675, Massasoit's son, Metacomet, known by the Pilgrims as \"King Philip,\" fought a war of resistance against the New England colonists. At the war's end, 600 were killed and 1,200 houses burned in the English side; 3,000 Indians were killed, many of them victims of outright massacres by the colonists. Survivors were sold into slavery.\n\nPhilip was finally hunted down and eventually murdered. The colonists displayed Philip's head on a pole in Plymouth, where it remained for 25 years.\n\nThis story of conquest and resistance is not part of the \"Thanksgiving\" myth because the myth is meant to sanitize history and make the invasion of the Americas by European conquerors a benign and sublime national origin story.\n\nIndeed, in 1970, the Massachusetts Department of Commerce asked the Wampanoags to select a speaker to mark the 350th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing. Before Wamsutta Frank James could read his speech, though, it had to be approved by the people in charge of the ceremony. Here is what they decided not to allow him to read:\n\nToday is a time of celebrating for you...but it is not a time of celebrating for me. It is with heavy heart that I look back upon what happened to my people...The Pilgrims had hardly explored the shores of Cape Cod four days before they had robbed the graves of my ancestors and stolen their corn... Massassoit, the great leader of the Wampanoag, knew these facts; yet he and his people welcomed and befriended the settlers...[B]efore 50 years were to pass, the Wampanoags...and other Indians living near the settlers would be killed by their guns or dead from diseases that we caught from them...Although our way of life is almost gone and our language is almost extinct, we the Wampanoags still walk the lands of Massachusetts... What has happened cannot change, but today we work toward a better America, a more Indian America where people and nature are once again more important.\n\nIn response to the censorship, a group calling itself the United American Indians of New England declared the Thanksgiving holiday to be a National Day of Mourning.\n\nOn that day in 1970, protesters boarded the Mayflower II (a replica of the Pilgrims' original ship, built in 1957) and tore the Union Jack from the mast. It was replaced with the flag that had flown the year before over liberated Alcatraz Island when Indian activists in California had occupied it, and offered to buy Alcatraz from the government for $24, the same price the Dutch paid for Manhattan.\n\nTHE UNITED American Indians of New England have held a Day of Mourning every year since in Plymouth.\n\nThirty-two years later, at the Day of Mourning in 2001, Moonanum James drew the connection between the resistance of Native Americans in the past and the struggles they face today:\n\nBack in 1970, those who started Day of Mourning spoke of terrible racism and poverty. Racism is still alive and well. Our people still are mired in the deepest poverty. We still lack decent health care, education and housing. Every winter, thousands of our people have to make a bitter choice between heating and eating. Our youth suicide rates, our rates of alcoholism continue to be the highest in the nation. As the economy crumbles around us, these conditions will only worsen. Today, we mourn the loss of millions of our ancestors and the devastation of our beautiful land and water and air. We pray for our people who have died during this past year. We join America in grieving for those who lost their lives at the World Trade Center. And I hope that you will join me in grieving, too, for the immense suffering of our sisters and brothers in Afghanistan, in Palestine, in Iraq--human beings who are referred to by this government as \"collateral damage.\" We remember all too well that our people throughout the Americas have for centuries been the \"collateral damage\" of the European invasion. The events of this past September were tragic and have affected all of us. Many innocent people lost their lives. We condemn all acts of violence and terrorism perpetrated by all governments and organizations against innocent civilians worldwide. And we condemn the racial profiling and detentions that are being directed against our Arab, South Asian and Muslim brothers and sisters in this country. But the events of September 11 were certainly not the first acts of terrorism to have occurred in this country. Since Columbus and the rest of the Europeans invaded our lands, Native people have been virtually nonstop victims of terrorism. I think of the slaughter of the Pequots at Mystic, Connecticut, in 1637. I think of U.S. military massacres of peaceful Native people at Wounded Knee and Sand Creek, and so many, many other places. I think of the armed assault by the FBI on a peaceful encampment at Pine Ridge in the 1970s. In fact, the very foundations of this powerful and wealthy country are the theft of our lands and slaughter of Native peoples and the kidnapping and enslavement of our African-American sisters and brothers. And the U.S.-assisted terrorism against Native peoples continues to this day in all too many countries in Central and South America... These are indeed difficult times. But our ancestors and our traditions will give us the strength that we need. Always we must remember that we shall endure. A handful of us somehow managed to survive Columbus and the conquistadors and the Pilgrims and the French and all the other invaders. Beautiful Native youth: Remember what your ancestors went through to bring you here. We are like the dirt, like the sand, like the tides. We shall endure. The struggle will continue. In the spirit of Crazy Horse, in the spirit of Zapata, in the spirit of Metacom, in the spirit of Anna Mae Aquash, in the spirit of Geronimo: We are not vanishing. We are not conquered. We are as strong as ever."}, "http://www.theonion.com/article/insecure-frustrated-bully-with-something-to-prove--33427": {"title": "Insecure, Frustrated Bully With Something To Prove Considering Career In Law Enforcement", "keywords": ["Local", " Our Annual Year 2013", " police", " News", " Vol 49 Issue 32", " Local"], "url": "http://www.theonion.com/article/insecure-frustrated-bully-with-something-to-prove--33427", "text": "RALEIGH, NC\u2014Calling it his lifelong dream, local man Brendan Lockhart, an insecure and perpetually frustrated bully who believes he has something to prove to the world, told reporters Thursday that he is seriously considering a career in law enforcement.\n\nLockhart, a recent high-school graduate who sources confirmed is plagued by resentment, self-doubt, unexpected fits of rage, and has always had a penchant for tormenting those who are smaller and weaker than him, explained that he feels he is well suited to serve as a police officer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a cop,\u201d said Lockhart, whose paranoia and inferiority complex constantly haunt him, leading him to lash out at others in order to convince them he is in control. \u201cI know it\u2019s a tough line of work, but I think I\u2019ve got what it takes to earn my shield and get out there and keep the peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the job I was born to do,\u201d continued the man whose main goal in life is to prove to others that he is strong, confident, and not afraid.\n\nFriends and family confirmed that Lockhart, an unpredictable, petty individual who frequently loses his temper when he feels he is being threatened or disrespected, has in recent months been inquiring into joining the ranks of the Raleigh Police Department. In this role, the man with a massive chip on his shoulder and no visible sense of empathy would be tasked with peacefully resolving disputes and evenhandedly administering justice to members of the community over whom he would have official power.\n\nSpecifically, sources speculated that should Lockhart successfully complete the 17-week officer training program and cursory psychological examination necessary to become a cop, the 18-year-old, who suffers from feelings of inadequacy and frequently explodes in emotional outbursts against people he perceives to be mocking him, would on a daily basis be placed in delicate situations requiring extreme patience and sound judgment.\n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s encouraging me to go to the academy, and he says that once I graduate I can probably get a job around here,\u201d said Lockhart, referring to the man whose own lack of compassion and propensity for inexplicable violence is largely to blame for similar patterns in his son, and who is himself a veteran police officer. \u201cOnce I\u2019m a cop, I\u2019m going to do what I have to do to make sure these neighborhoods stay safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet a lot of people don\u2019t think I can do it, but I\u2019ll show them,\u201d continued the man who could in six months\u2019 time possess both a standard-issue firearm and the city-sanctioned authority to unholster and fire the weapon.\n\nWhen pressed for further comment, sources close to the man who hopes to play an active role in protecting his community confirmed that Lockhart constantly goes out of his way to intimidate and belittle those people he knows are too submissive to fight back. The 18-year-old often fantasizes at length about getting revenge on those he believes have wronged him. When frustrated or enraged with his own general powerlessness in the world, he reportedly has a tendency to take out these emotions on the first person he comes across, with little or no provocation. Lockhart routinely gets in screaming arguments with others and must be physically restrained as his anger reaches a white-hot pitch, frightening all around him. A devoted fan of mixed martial arts, Lockhart is capable of watching YouTube videos of people being pummeled senselessly for hours at a time.\n\nSources also felt it bears mentioning that Lockhart is an impassioned and unapologetic racist.\n\nWhen asked to outline his motivations for entering the field of law enforcement, the perpetually infuriated bully who could very soon be responsible for the security and well-being of thousands of innocent people explained that he feels a personal obligation to do whatever necessary to safeguard society.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bad people out there who think they can get away with doing whatever they want, and someone has to stop them,\u201d said Lockhart, his hands unconsciously closing into tight fists. \u201cSo if I don\u2019t step up and show everyone who\u2019s boss, who will?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlus, I\u2019ve been talking to my buddies at the gym, and a bunch of them are gonna be cops too,\u201d Lockhart continued. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great.\u201d"}, "https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/the-white-houses-lgbt-rights-page-has-disappeared/": {"title": "The White House\u2019s LGBT rights page has disappeared", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/the-white-houses-lgbt-rights-page-has-disappeared/", "text": "And so the transition of power begins.

In doing so, they offer a glimpse into this darkness.\n\nTogether, these releases tell us a lot about the wealthy few who run the world.\n\nWe now know that the British royal family has been less than open with the people they rule, who preserve their dubious privilege to monarchy. And we have learned that, by investing in a Lithuanian shopping center as an end run around taxes, U2\u2019s Bono may have finally found what he\u2019s looking for.\n\nBut these reports also help us see how much we still don\u2019t know about the powerful few. In an era when, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, only three Americans \u2014 Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett \u2014 own more wealth than half of our entire population, we need to do more to understand \u2014 and confront \u2014 the super-concentration of resources.\n\nThe Swiss bank UBS and the American accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers weren\u2019t looking to write an expos\u00e9 when they prepared their annual \u201cBillionaires Insights\u201d report for 2017. On the contrary. So-called \u201cvery high net worth individuals\u201d are the financial industry\u2019s most sought-after clients. The report is entitled, without any apparent irony, \u201cNew value creators gain momentum.\u201d\n\nAnd gain momentum these billionaires did. As the report notes, \u201cGlobally, the total wealth of billionaires rose by +17 percent in 2016, up from USD $5.1 trillion to USD6.0 trillion.\u201d\n\nDid your net worth grow by 17 percent last year? Unless you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s 1,542 billionaires, chances are it didn\u2019t.\n\nIn the United States, wealth for most households grew at a much slower rate, while racial disparities in wealth persist in middle-class households.\n\nAnalyses from economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman show a dramatic gain in income for the very wealthy \u2014 and no one else \u2014 in recent decades. In a useful explainer, David Leonhardt of The New York Times concluded:\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve reports that millions of Americans continue to struggle. Thirty percent of adults, roughly 73 million people, are finding it difficult to make ends meet or are barely getting by. Just under one-fourth of all adults said they could not pay all their bills for the current month. Forty-four percent said they could not cover an emergency expense of $400, and one-fourth of all adults reported that they had to forgo medical treatment during the past year because of the cost.\n\nAs of last report, America\u2019s 10 wealthiest men \u2014 they are all men \u2014 are collectively worth more than $633 billion. The combined wealth of these 10 men has risen by nearly $116 billion since the start of this year alone.\n\nThe explosive growth of billionaire wealth, at a time when the middle class is dying and millions of Americans are struggling, has implications for democracy as well as the economy.\n\nThe work of political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page has shown that the preferences of the majority have very little effect on government policy, while the political wishes of the wealthy few are far more likely to become reality.\n\nAs history teaches us, centralized wealth often leads to political oligarchy. Our country is no exception. Expand this oligarchical effect across the globe, and you get a sense of the global reach of the billionaire class. As Oxfam international reported earlier this year, just eight men possesses as much of the world\u2019s wealth as half the global population.\n\nThe author of the UBS/PwC report commented that \u201cWe are now two years into the peak of the second Gilded Age,\u201d with levels of inequality not seen since 1905. He also says that \u201cthis is something billionaires are concerned about,\u201d leading to fears that the world\u2019s population could \u201cstrike back.\u201d\n\nThe report lists some of the ways the billionaire class spends its money. Art collections, sports clubs and philanthropy all rate a mention. Recent political events in the US demonstrate that they\u2019re also using their power to further enrich themselves and keep the majority from \u201cstriking back.\u201d\n\nOne thing the wealthy are apparently not doing with their money is paying much in taxes. The ICIJ\u2019s Panama Papers revealed that many people are using illegal means to avoiding taxation.\n\nThe Paradise Papers reveal something equally important: how billionaires and corporations can evade taxation \u2014 and public scrutiny of their wealth \u2014 through legal means. These documents were obtained from Appleby, one of the world\u2019s leading law firms specializing in offshore accounts.\n\nThe New York Times recently profiled two billionaire political donors, one Democratic and one Republican, in an article about the papers that also cited an Appleby publication on the ultrawealthy\u2019s problem of \u201cmotivating children with means.\u201d\n\nThe Appleby brochure includes the picture of a small boy in a three-piece suit; apparently that counts as cute to the super-rich. Another handout shows \u201ca handsome couple\u201d rushing to board a private jet, while another is captioned \u201cwealth seeks out safe harbours.\u201d\n\nAppleby clients include prominent Democrats like Penny Pritzker, commerce secretary under President Obama, George Soros and the aforementioned donor, James Simons. They also include prominent Republicans like Sheldon Adelson, Carl Icahn and billionaire Robert Mercer, who used some of the money he saved avoiding taxes to set Steve Bannon up with a media empire.\n\nWhen it comes to disseminating their ideas, it\u2019s striking how many hard-core conservatives don\u2019t trust the \u201cfree market\u201d to get the job done.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders has called for an investigation into the papers, noting that corporations such as Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Apple and Nike are implicated in the documents.\n\nOffshore havens do more than just help clients evade taxes. They also help them avoid responsibility. As The Times reports, \u201canother offshore firm\u2026 advertises that it helps clients \u2018preserve wealth from the ravages of litigation, political tumult and divorce.\u2019\u201d\n\nPop stars also availed themselves of Appleby\u2019s services, including the aforementioned Bono, who took advantage of Malta\u2019s generous tax rates for foreign investors when he funneled money into that Lithuanian shopping center.\n\nBut then, the self-satisfied singer has a long history of giving high-minded speeches while failing to deliver for the poor, either personally or politically.\n\nIn his book The Frontman, author Harry Browne writes that Bono\u2019s politics are \u201cbroadly \u2026 conservative\u201d and can be seen as \u201cfundamentally nonthreatening to the elites that have wreaked havoc on the world.\u201d To Browne, Bono is \u201ca slick mix of traditional missionary and commercial colonialism, in which the poor world exists as a task for the rich world to complete.\u201d\n\nIn an oligarchical world, figures like Bono matter. They provide the singer\u2019s \u201cfriends,\u201d who range from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Jesse Helms, with a veneer of conscience. They inoculate members of the global elite from the guilt that is rightfully theirs.\n\nSpeaking of \u201cfrontmen\u201d: the papers also show that Britain\u2019s Prince Charles invested millions of pounds offshore. His estate insisted that the investment, which may have indirectly benefited from the prince\u2019s environmental campaigns, be kept secret. The Queen also invested heavily in offshore companies, including one that has been criticized for exploiting poor families.\n\nThe Royals insisted that they obtain no tax advantage from these investments, which suggests that the public face of Britain\u2019s government may well have been trying to hide its wealth from Britain\u2019s people.\n\nThe authors of the UBS report probably didn\u2019t intend these words to sound as ominous as they do:\n\nThey are undoubtedly correct. Americans need look no further then Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet and circle of advisers, where billionaires gather to plot everyone else\u2019s future while the rest of the Republican Party dutifully falls in line. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn were among those implicated by the Paradise Papers.\n\nThe effect of billionaire \u201cnetworks\u201d may also be found in the Democratic Party\u2019s struggle to develop a platform that reflects the needs of working Americans without alienating very many high-net-worth donors. Hint: It can\u2019t be done.\n\nConcentrated wealth tends to be amoral, and the ultrawealthy are growing more powerful all the time. And since small businesses usually can\u2019t afford the services of firms like Appleby, legalized tax evasion increases inequality among both individuals and businesses.\n\nHow can the United States and the world respond before it\u2019s too late? Economists like Piketty and Zucman have called for a global wealth tax, although that would be difficult to enforce.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) argued that taxes on the Western world\u2019s 1 percent should be \u201csignificantly higher.\u201d The Paradise Papers illustrate the importance of ending legalized tax evasion, and Zucman wrote an op-ed on the topic for The New York Times.\n\nBut it is hard to pass such measures in today\u2019s political world. Here in the United States, there\u2019s a strong chance Trump and Congress will cut taxes on billionaires and corporations instead. That\u2019s what that happens when wealth becomes too concentrated and political power follows suit.\n\n\n\n What We\u2019re Looking For\n\nThe undemocratic and unequal state of our own country can no longer be hidden.

It\u2019s an op-ed we collaborated with him on.\u201d\n\nForbes removed the story from its website on Wednesday and said that it ended its relationship with Mr. Miller amid the revelations.\n\n\u201cAll contributors to Forbes.com sign a contract requiring them to disclose any potential conflicts of interest and only publish content that is their own original writing,\u201d Mia Carbonell, a Forbes spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWhen it came to our attention that Mr. Miller violated these terms, we removed his blog from Forbes.com and ended our relationship with him.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller\u2019s work has also appeared in the opinion pages of The New York Times.\n\n\u201cWe have never paid Dr. Miller,\u201d said Sam Murphey, a spokesman for Monsanto. \u201cOur scientists have never collaborated with Dr. Miller on his submissions to The New York Times.

Wallace Hayes, the former editor of a journal, Food and Chemical Toxicology, has had a contractual relationship with Monsanto. In 2013, while he was still editor, Mr. Hayes retracted a key study damaging to Monsanto that found that Roundup, and genetically modified corn, could cause cancer and early death in rats.\n\nMr. Hayes said in an interview that he had not been under contract with Monsanto at the time of the retraction and was paid only after he left the journal.\n\n\u201cMonsanto played no role whatsoever in the decision that was made to retract,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was based on input that I got from some very well-respected people, and also my own evaluation.\u201d"}, "http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/trump-crosses-the-nazi-line-maybe-muslims-should-wear-special-id-badges/": {"title": "Trump crosses the Nazi line: Maybe Muslims should wear special ID badges", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/trump-crosses-the-nazi-line-maybe-muslims-should-wear-special-id-badges/", "text": "Five year old Avram Rosenthal and two year old brother Emanuel of the Kovno ghetto in Lithuania are shown.

When you speak with these survivors, you'll most likely hear the story of what it feels like to have an atomic bomb dropped on you as a 6-year-old child.\n\nExperts say six is the age kids first begin to process the concept of time. Time, the impact it has on our memories, our priorities, and our sense of responsibility for the crimes of our governments, is something I've been thinking about a lot.\n\nVeterans for Peace sponsored Marine Force Recon veteran Michael Hanes, our translator Rachel Clark, and myself on a goodwill trip to Japan. I'm a two-tour veteran of the U.S. war and occupation of Afghanistan with the Seventy-Fifth Ranger Regiment.\n\nFor the second year in a row, I traveled there to apologize, especially to the Hibakusha and their families. As insignificant as an apology feels 72 years after the bombing, it also seems like one of the most substantive things we can do to prevent such an attack from happening again.\n\nMike and I did not give the order to drop the bombs. We did not fight as soldiers in the war that dropped those bombs. However, we were pawns of the U.S. war machine in its latest, longest war.\n\nWe both partook in wars that have killed over a million people, the majority of them civilians. We signed up to fight terrorism but soon realized we were the ones doing the terrorizing.\n\nWe believe our role in the war on terror connects us in some way the 140,000 civilians who were killed within days of the atomic blasts. We believe that the deaths of so many civilians in both of these wars should never have happened.\n\nTHE CONSENSUS argument holds that the United States dropped those bombs on so many civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war and save millions of lives. This claim cannot be justified.\n\nThe war in the Pacific had ended by January of 1945. The Japanese were starving and the country could no longer manufacture what it needed to continue the fight. The United States had the ultra-secret purple and red Japanese cyphers transmitting this information. High-level government officials offered surrender terms to Douglas MacArthur a full seven months prior to the bombing, terms nearly identical to those accepted in Japan Bay on September 2, 1945.\n\nThis history remains largely untaught, just as the fact that the Taliban surrendered within months of the initial American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 remains untaught--to say nothing of the lies that led us into the Iraq War. Seventy years separates the Second World War and the global war on terror, but the cliched line nevertheless applies to both: \"Truth is the first casualty of war.\" This sense of being lied to, of being manipulated into participating in so much death and destruction, drove us to Japan.\n\nAs we uncovered the lies of the war we fought, we soon wanted to uncover the lies of other wars, especially the \"Good War,\" the one that is so often used to justify others. Learning the truth can only provide so much closure; stopping the lies that lead to war became our priority.\n\nWe hoped the trip would remind ourselves, those we met, and even those fighting in the United States' endless wars around the world that ordinary Americans, Japanese, Iraqis, Afghans, North Koreans, Syrians, Nigerians, Chinese--the list of countries the United States occupies and fights is lengthy, so take your pick--have infinitely more in common with each other than with our nations' leaders. This message seems especially relevant in President Trump's world of nationalism, white supremacy, and nuclear threats.\n\nSO OFTEN, we're asked to remember the few times the United States has been attacked on its own soil. Never forget 9/11. Never forget Pearl Harbor.\n\nRarely are we asked to remember when we dropped two atomic bombs on civilian populations. Maybe every American should visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Time makes people forget or at least take things less seriously, and that should never be the case with nuclear weapons.\n\nWhen the Hibakusha found out two American veterans were visiting the country on a peace tour, scores of them greeted us warmly. Seventy-two years have passed since the bombing, but many survivors still feel unheard.\n\n\"This is one of the reasons your visit is important. We can never have another atomic bomb detonate, under any circumstances. Maybe, as veterans, your government will listen to you. We know American service members are treated with great respect in the United States,\" Junji Maki, an 86-year-old survivor of the blast told me at a cafe in Hiroshima.\n\n\"Not that well, but if you follow U.S. sports, I can see why you'd think that,\" I replied.\n\n\"We want you to take our stories back home with you. Our government does anything your government tells them to do. Our government, relative to the United States, has no real power. We feel like a colony,\" another survivor and friend of Mr. Maki said. Given that the United States has as many as fifty thousand troops across scores of military bases in Japan, it was hard to disagree.\n\nWe stopped at Nagasaki, where the U.S. dropped the second atomic bomb on August 9, 1945, and spoke before Hibakusha at ground zero, where you can look up into the sky and see where the bomb detonated--something nearly impossible to imagine.\n\nA large and haunting statue of a woman, wearing a dress of roses and holding a dead child, looms over every visitor. August 9, 1945, 11:02 a.m.--the moment the bomb detonated--is the statue's only inscription. Some clocks around Nagasaki are frozen at 11:02 a.m., regular reminders of this anniversary.\n\nWe apologized from our knees to scores of survivors at ground zero:\n\nWe looked up and saw tears in the eyes of people old enough to be our grandparents.\n\nWE GAVE a short talk alongside two survivors, who accepted our apology, urged worldwide nuclear disarmament and even apologized for what the Japanese government did to the Chinese during that time. Though not our intent, our apology seemed to trigger reflections on the Japanese government's crimes as well.\n\nFollowing the event, we met with members of the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Survivors Council. One told us:\n\nIn aerial pictures from immediately after the blast, Mike and I could make out the remnants of churches. Then, Mr. Moriuchi, another survivor, handed me a postcard with an image of the severed marble head of the Virgin Mary, her eyes blown out. \"Wow, horrifying,\" was all I could muster, as a pit firmly lodged itself in my throat.\n\nMs. Fumie Kakita, only three at the time of the blast, said:\n\nMike and I listened solemnly, shaking our head in disgust. I felt like I should say more, but whatever I said would have felt meaningless--possibly disrespectful--in the wake of such stories.\n\nWe left the office and walked the grounds of the Peace Park to a monthly ceremony in front of an arched memorial for the American and Allied POWs who died during the blast. I asked why it existed. \"Soldiers were humans, too. Besides, few people talk about the Americans killed by the bomb. These stories need to be shared.\"\n\nI KNEW racism played a big part in the decision to drop the bombs. How could it not? These ceremonies, and the many reminders Mike and I received that Nagasaki was a Catholic town reflected an understanding that Americans might pay more attention to what happened if they felt like their people were slaughtered too.\n\nAnother survivor, Mitsushige Tanaka, began to tell his story:\n\nIt's not just those who lived through the blast who are affected. \"My daughter has a disease called microcephaly, which means she has an abnormally small head. Many of the children who were born after the blast have mental difficulties,\" said Ms. Fumie Kakita, a survivor. She went on:\n\nAfter the final ceremony of the day, we walked back to the hotel, exhausted. We had many more talks and ceremonies ahead of us. Each story made our apologies feel more urgent.\n\nAs we walked home I noticed large and powerful-looking trees lining our path. They were turning bright orange and red in the early December chill. I asked Rachel what they were. \"Those are camphor trees. Despite being scorched and defoliated during the blast, somehow they survived. They still stand in large numbers throughout Nagasaki. Aren't they beautiful?\""}, "https://web.archive.org/web/20160127055650/http://fresnopeoplesmedia.com/2016/01/2829/": {"title": "Activist Predicts Death, Says The Cops Killed Him", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160127055650/http://fresnopeoplesmedia.com/2016/01/2829/", "text": "The man who was found stabbed inside a burning home in Fresno last week is confirmed to be John Lang, a frequent poster in the Fresno People\u2019s Media group on Facebook and acquaintance to many in the Fresno activist community.\n\nMac McCauley \u00b7 Granite Bay, California What occured in your life to bring you to the attention of the cops, both city and county, that you believe you are being stalked?

End quote..\n\nThe next day, Jan. 14, John\u2019s Facebook posts became increasingly alarmist (or so we thought).\n\nOn the 15th, he reached out to reporter Corin Hoggard and claimed that Fresno cops would try to kill him in the next few days.\n\nOn the 16th, he posted a video showing people he believed meant him imminent harm.\n\nHe also asked people to stay at his house with him, with guns, to protect him from \u201cthe bad guys\u201d in the van.\n\nJan. 17, he wrote this open letter to the DOJ and FBI.\n\nOpen Letter the the USDOJ and the FBI I am fairly certain that Fresno Law Enforcement is trying to set me up on some type a charge related to child pornography. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out why they would send Child Molester George Adams Ramirez my way when I was renting the property next to me for Don Green. Also I was at a loss as to how Fresno LE was able to turn so many people against me so quickly. The only thing that makes sense coupled with George Ramirez situation is if Fresno LE told these folks I was a child porn suspect. Imagine a police officer dressed in his official uniform pulling up in a police cruiser. Imagine the same police officer or detective telling a group of coworkers of the accused or other folks that said person is a bad guy who is under investigation for the crimes of child pornography, and cops would like their help in putting a really bad guy away. This would be a no brainier for most reasonable people. There is no more heinous, hideous, and inhuman crime than that of a child porn person. This crime evokes more human emotion than any other. And it is to that effect that Fresno Law Enforcement uses to suit their purpose in my situation. It\u2019s Fresno Law Enforcement\u2019s \u201cweapon of mass destruction\u201d. This would also explain why the FBI shows little interest in my pleas for help. There has long been a believe in Law Enforcement circles that if someone is guilty of something, then helping that process along by fabricating evidence is completely acceptable. This rational can provide a loophole for truth and justice to be ignored when an innocent person is charged or suspected of crimes, as it is with my situation. Let this example serve as a warning to all my activist and blogger friends. We are by no means free. If and when the Government targets us, we are completely and utterly done, and there is really nothing we can do about it. Through my example the Government is trying to drive home the point that they want obidient, submisive, and loyal subjects. And they will settle for nothing less.. I\u2019m also fairly certain I\u2019ve figured out how Fresno Law Enforcement handled the actual access and internet distribution of the offensive material. Let\u2019s just say that the FEDS should re-investigate all Child porn cases in Fresno where ATT Internet Services provided the Internet service. Especially cases where the accused had a conflict with the City Of Fresno or high ranking City of Fresno personnel. Other elements are simply handled by planting various elements of false evidence here and there once they enter a residence. That is why Fresno LE was so determined to get a search warrant for an official home entry in my case. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past Fresno LE had already illegally and secretly entered by home, copied my hard drives in order to get a good game plan for the eventual false arrest. There also appears to be a pattern here. Anyone who has ever talked publicly about, accused, or discussed Jerry Dyer\u2019s suposed sex scandle with that 16 year old girl has found themselfs in some type of legal peril within a few short years.. And with this letter I have for certain signed my death warrant with Fresno LE. Kind Regards, John Lang Fresno Ca 93728\n\nJohn first reached out to us in May of 2015. Like many, we thought he was paranoid. Shortly after the initial contact, he registered several domain names for a website that served as an online diary of his experiences. He also had a YouTube channel with 17 videos, all from his home surveillance system. The videos, he says, show police intimidation and suspicious characters who are part of a conspiracy to destroy him.\n\nThe content below is unedited and uncut from John\u2019s diary.\n\nJohn says his story starts in 2009.\n\nI was having trouble in my marriage. Then I was ticketed two blocks away from the Home Depot on West Shaw in Fresno, where I had just visited. I later learned that Fresno Law Enforcement had a \u201cpattern of practice\u201d of unethically scanning license plates on private retail parking lots. They then pull the unsuspecting drivers over a block or two away from said parking lots. This was meant to optimize ticket revenue at a very minimal expense. Millions of dollars of revenue has been generated in this questionable manner by Fresno area Law Enforcement agencies. A \u201cpattern of practice\u201d that is still in use today by Fresno area Law Enforcement agencies. The added financial stress related to this incident crippled what was left of my marriage. I was devastated, angry, and upset. I thought the parking lot license plate scanning was abusive and simply designed as a revenue generating scheme for the City of Fresno. So, as an expression of peaceful protest I voiced my opinion on the Fresno Bee, which I now realize was a mistake. I thought I was anonymous, but an employee at the Fresno Bee, \u201cJody Murray\u201d was \u201cfeeding\u201d a known Sheriff Sergeant who used the alias hikerdude67 or hikerdude1967 website log data containing identifiable ip address information that Fresno LE used to track down Fresno Citizens who were posting comments critical of Fresno LE and the City of Fresno. Preliminary identification identifies hikerdude1967 as Jared L McCormick, a Fresno County Sheriff Sergeant. Within weeks I was vehicle \u201ctailed\u201d by undercover Sheriff officers who were routinely waiting on the street near my home. One individual I recognized by his very unique hair and facial features was the same Sheriff personnel who a few years later followed me into a Save Mart grocery store located at Clinton and Blackstone. The details of this later incident are listed in the 12/01/14 \u201cTime Line / Notes section\u201d, which can be found below. Fresno PD was also occasionally following me as well, although their harassment participation was exponentially growing. In 2013 and 2014 I was being followed very frequently by Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel. The frequency was so high that both agencies had obviously gps\u2019d my car or my phone, they seemed to be \u201cpopping up everywhere\u201d. I also believe that Fresno LE (both PD and Sheriff) was also \u201ctapping\u201d my phone and my ex-wife\u2019s phone, either illegally, or by obtaining a warrant under false premise and or claims. I later learned from other commenters on the Bee, that other posters who were known to be critical Fresno LE and the City of Fresno were also targeted by Fresno LE. I learned Fresno LE including Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel had a pattern of \u201charassment and intimidation\u201d against citizens who criticized Fresno Law Enforcement, Fresno Government, or Fresno Public employees. There were many posters discussing this problem of Fresno LE retaliation for speaking out about Fresno Police abuses.\n\nHe says police harassment peaked in 2013 during the Measure G campaign.\n\nThe surveillance and harassment peaked about a year and a half ago or so when Measure G was on the ballot. I was a fairly well known commenter on the Fresno Bee and had over 2500 comments and over 3000 likes (up votes). I was a fierce opponent against Mayor Ashley Swearengin\u2019s Measure G campaign. I was also critical of Fresno Law Enforcement and other City of Fresno departments. I now realize this was not a good idea. I had debated Fire Chief Brown regarding fire budgets a few days before his well publicized incident. I was an overt poster, and unwittingly and naively, I was also becoming a target. Based on my experience of being followed by Fresno LE personnel (PD and Sheriff) I had publicly stated on the Bee that \u201cFresno PD and the Fresno Sheriff\u2019s department had a \u201cFile\u201d and \u201cData\u201d on anyone who was even remotely critical of Fresno LE. And, for what purpose the \u201cFile\u201d had, I had no idea, but I knew it wasn\u2019t anything good. But, after my experience with Fresno PD and the Fresno Sheriff\u2019s personnel I clearly understood what the \u201cFile\u201d meant. I had a target on my back and Fresno PD and the Sheriff\u2019s Department we going to stop at nothing to get me, even if it meant breaking the law and violating my civil rights. Months later the Fresno Bee switched their comment system to a FaceBook only set up and 90 percent of the commenters left. After this transition I terminated my posting on the Bee and sent an email to the Bee Editor Jim Borden on 9/13/13 and 9/17/13 explaining that a Bee employee named \u201cJody Murray\u201d was sharing the ip log data of Bee commenters with Fresno Sheriff personnel and Sheriff personnel were subsequently harassing these folks who were posting comments on the Bee website. I also sent an email to a Sacramento Bee reporter phecht@sacbee.com on 3/24/14 regarding the same allegation, neither of the two replied back to me. After I sent those emails, simple vehicle \u201ctailing\u201d harassment escalated into something more serious. I believe that during the last year and a half or so, and post 9/13/13 and 9/17/13 a small group of Fresno Sheriff personnel and Fresno Police officers, as retaliation and punishment, has initiated a multitude of investigations on me, through a multitude of agencies, in an effort to discredit and destroy me. They also instituted an aggressive campaign of harassment and intimidation that consisted of, by not limited to: covert and overt vehicle \u201ctailing\u201d on numerous occasions, illegally wire tapping of my phone line and my ex-wife\u2019s phone line, and my 10 year old daughters phone line. With the information gained through these illegal wire taps they have contacted my professional business customers insinuating that I am a bad guy who is currently under various investigations and that it might be best if they didn\u2019t do business with me.\n\nHe mentions illegal emissions stickers, a reoccurring topic in his story.\n\nApproximately in April or May of 2014 I received a call from a person to look at a Jet Ski that I placed for sale on Craig\u2019s List. Three people showed up for this appointment. One had all the mannerisms and personality of a LE person. He was tall with an average build and short cropped blond hair and based on his mannerism I believe this person was Fresno Sheriff personnel. The other one, surprisingly, was Jody Murray. However at the time I did not realize he was Jody Murray. The third person was a younger male, slightly heavy set, riding a newer modern motorcycle. Following this appointment, which was also after my email to Jim Borden and the Sacramento bee reporter, the harassment significantly spiked. More recently, during the last three months I have been followed much more frequently. Since Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel seems to always appear as I was out at some location doing my daily routine, I assumed they had GPS\u2019ed my phone or car. This, I believe was how they are tracking and following me. On 12/01/14 I was followed to the Save Mart at Blackstone and Clinton (see date notes for Dec 1, 2014). I was also followed into the store. The person following me was continuously talking on the phone with someone. I believe this person in the store was giving a second party my activities and precise time estimates of my shopping progress. I believe this second party was then using these time estimates to illegally enter my residence and property. And, I believe it\u2019s happened more than once. I had been noticing odd events on certain occasions when I would return home from shopping or picking up my daughter from school. I have more detail on these events in the time line section of this letter. Based on what I\u2019ve described above I believe these individuals have planted something in my residence and are planning to arrest me on some false charge or perhaps worse. I operate a small marine repair shop and recently I have received numerous calls regarding fake emission stickers which allow boaters bypass gross polluter laws on Personal Water Craft vessels. I had never heard of these fake stickers before and I\u2019ve never before had phone calls from new customers discussing illegal activities with me. I had nearly five of these calls in a 3 day period. One of these calls was a referral from a newer customer of mine, Tim Tompsett, who works for the City of Fresno\u2019s Wastewater division. See the notes dated: 3/09/2015 7:18 PM. As mentioned earlier I also believe Fresno LE has also contacted my customers from my part time businesses (property management and webhosting), this information, they would only have access to by accessing my home computer or illegally wiretapping my phone. One such incident was in March of 2015. I had just had a conservation on the phone with Bryan Andre of Aquatic Pets (http://www.aquaticpets.net) in Clovis California, 559-298-4549. For over 10 years he has been a web customer of mine and always has good follow up with invoices and questions. He had asked me to rebuild his website and called to check on the progress of the website. I told him it would be done in a couple of days. He said \u201cgreat\u201d and asked me to follow up with him in a couple of days. Following up a couple of days later I called him back but suddenly he stopped returning my calls and emails. In one email to which I sent over 15 he said he really liked the new site design and told me to send him an invoice. I have sent multiple invoices and emails to which he never responds. This is extremely uncharacteristic of Bryan, and as stated, I have known him for over 10 years. I believe Fresno Sheriff\u2019s personnel listening in on my phone conversations made contact with Bryan and told him I was a \u201cbad\u201d guy who was under various investigations. Bryan eventually did email me and claimed he canceled his services with me because he thought I charged too much. After 10 years and an agreement on this particular price for a new website he thought I charged too much? Fresno Law Enforcement were using their illegal wiretaps or \u201cStingRay Devices\u201d to determine who my customers were so they could meddle and create conflict with my customers. This is part of the Fresno LE conspiracy with the Fresno Sheriff Department in the lead to financially and legally ruin me for my past comments on the Fresno Bee, and emailing Jim Borden the Fresno Bee Editor details of the scheme between Jody Murray and Fresno Sheriff personnel. Prior to Dec 1st 2014 I hadn\u2019t kept a log of harassment activities, but I did post pre 2014 incidents on the Fresno Bee\u2019s old comment system using the handle \u201cJohn21\u201d. The Bee has since migrated to a facebook only system so I\u2019m not sure where this old comment data would be. But Jody Murray, the Bee Content and Web manager who was providing commenters ip address\u2019s to Fresno Sheriff Personnel would likely have access to this old data. Again, a known Fresno Sheriff who used the handle hikerdude67 or hikerdude1967 on the Fresno Bee was accused publicly in the Bee comment section by other commenters of posting, and having \u201cknowledge\u201d of other commenters personal information. A few days after this public accusation the commenter hickerdude1967 no longer appeared in any of the Bee\u2019s comment sections. The \u201cword\u201d on the Bee was that Fresno County Sheriff administrators had gotten \u201cword\u201d of the activities of hikerdude1967 and requested he terminate his activities on the Fresno Bee. 12/01/14 \u2013 I was followed to the Save Mart Shopping center at Blackstone and Clinton by what I believe to be Fresno Sheriff personnel. As I was at the meat counter, a fast walking person talking on a cell phone came into the store and abruptly stopped at the main opening of the grocery store. He did a complete 360 as if he was searching for someone. I noticed him right away because of his behavior. He didn\u2019t appear to be a typical shopper. As we made eye contact, he appeared startled that I had noticed him. I was at the meat counter which is near the entrance of the store. As I left the store with my groceries I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. But, as I made my way to the parking lot and started to unlock my trunk, he came out of the store, still talking on the phone. He walked past me without making eye contact and entered a late model green Chevy or GMC Step-Side truck with custom chrome rims. As I entered my car and pulled out, I drove slowly past the rear of his vehicle in an attempt to read his license plate. However I couldn\u2019t remember the license plate number, because, as I left the store I was interrupted by a phone call. About two blocks away from the store I received a call from a person who sarcastically said my full name, then proceeded to ask me questions about a boat repair. The Number was: 559-392-5087. I\u2019ve never had a customer address me by my first and last name before, especially someone I hadn\u2019t talked to before. I\u2019m confident this number and caller is connected to this SaveMart incident. I believe this person and others is related to something more complicated and devious than simple harassment. This type of \u201cclose proximity\u201d tracking can only mean one thing. I believe this person and others are tacking and monitoring my minute by minute incremental movements so they can direct another party to illegally enter my residence for the purpose of gaining \u201cintel\u201d or planting evidence. I had suspected that someone was entering my home in the past. For example, on August 1st or 2nd, 2014, I returned from Home Depot to find my inner back door locked. In 10 years I have never locked this inner door, because there is no key to open it, I simply use it as a pull handle. I simply lock the outer metal security door. I was so alarmed by this event that I grabbed a pipe and kicked in the inner door thinking a burglar was inside my residence. The only person who would lock this inner door would be someone who is unfamiliar with this residence. My Daughter witnessed this event as did my periodic helper and friend Juan Ramirez (559-213-7860). 12/13/2014 \u2013 Silver Quad Cab Ford 4\u00d74 truck continually driving past my house as I did lawn and yard work in my front yard. After making \u201ceye contact\u201d with the driver of vehicle, and as he passed by, I immediately received a hang-up call from 559-389-0357.\n\nHe elaborates about Eli Rodriguez in the description of the video:\n\nEli Rodriguez is the Fresno Sheriff personnel who was going to set me up on the Jet Ski emission scam. He dropped of a 2 stroke Evinrude motor on at my shop on 3-02-2015. His plan was to drop off the motor, then at a later time enter my property with the assistance of George and Maxine Ramirez my neighbors who were placed there by Fresno Law Enforcement personnel, plant evidence, then pick up the engine at a later time and lie and say I was trying to sell him fake emission stickers, then he would falsely arrest me. I knew something was amiss on these \u201cemission stickers\u201d because I was receiving a ridiculous amount of calls on them. And curiously Tim Tompsett of the Fresno Waste Water division who has numerous close relationships with Fresno Law Enforcement personnel had sent me a boat repair referral who, without warning, sent me an illegal \u201cemission sticker\u201d directly to my cell phone during a discussion about a boat repair. Eli Rodriguez is one of the main players in this Fresno Law Enforcement conspiracy to enter my property to set me up and plant false evidence while I was away from my home. He either directly participated in entering my property via Law Enforcement grade \u201cJiggler keys or lock pics\u201d, or he knows the other Fresno LE personnel who entered my home. This explains the extreme surveillance I was under, including but not limited to moving George and Maxine Ramirez into the property right next to me. This would give them very accurate \u201cwindows of opportunity\u201d and \u201ctime frames\u201d so they could comfortably access my property without being detected. However, they made some mistakes. Eli Rodriguez may be an alias but the guy in this video with the pictured vehicle and canine in the back of the vehicle is the person who dropped off the engine and provided information on the repair tag as Eli Rodriguez with the phone number 559-458-6774. The phone number is accurate because he contacted me numerous times via that number after dropping off his motor. This one guy \u201cEli Rodriguez\u201d knows all the details of every crime Fresno PD and the Fresno Sheriff\u2019s office have committed regarding my harassment and conspiracy case. When this guys cracks, and I\u2019m sure he will because this guy is a risk taker, and as a result he is already on the radar of Federal Law Enforcement. He is one of \u201cmajor players\u201d of a rogue underground crew of local corrupt and criminal Fresno Law Enforcement Officers similar to the recent \u201cbusted\u201d Oakland Crew of bad Cops called the \u201cRough Riders\u201d. This entire case will then blow wide open when the Feds get him in for a proper interrogation. He is the keystone piece who can bring 20 to 30 other corrupt Fresno Cops down with him.. 4/11/2015 \u2013 At approximately 8:30 Pm on 4/11/2015 George and Maxine Ramirez, my neighbors at 656 N. Van Ness Ave, invite me over to their house. After an hour and a half or so I start to get uncomfortable. I stand up from sitting on the couch and explain I need to leave because I believe I\u2019ve lost my wallet. As I walk toward the door Maxine Ramirez immediately blocks my path to the door and puts her hands up and says \u201cno you can\u2019t leave, just sit down\u201d. I replied \u201cMaxine, please don\u2019t block me.\u201d As I move past her out the front door Maxine yells \u201cGeorge\u201d! At this point my \u201cflight or fight\u201d response starts to kick in. As I made my way out the front door toward the front yard gate, George, who heard Maxine\u2019s call rushed toward the front yard gate. You can clearly see me in the video trying to find a way over the fence and back into my yard, as George, a larger man who was a Vietnam Vet blocks access to the front gate. He pretends to be unlocking the gate but he\u2019s really blocking my access. I finally hop the fence to the left of the gate and George then quickly comes through the gate and follows me. Again, in the supplied video (Video Footnotes 5A) you can clearly see me hopping the fence in order to escape George and Maxine\u2019s property. As I move to unlock my driveway gate George and Maxine hover over me. I have to keep telling them to get back and give me some room. They would not step back and they kept telling me to get back in their house. To get away from them I move to my small front yard gate where George continues to follow me. George kept yelling my name very loudly numerous times, which at the time really seemed to served no purpose, it was quite bizarre. Later I realized he must have been trying to signal someone who was in my house, likely his associate Eli Rodriguez. My unexpected departure from their house may have messed up their time schedule of illegal entry into my house. George continued to come closer and I finally yelled at him and told him the get the \u201chell\u201d back. I finally made it onto my property. The only motive for George and Maxine Ramirez to \u201cmaintain\u201d and \u201chold\u201d me against my will would be because they were coordinating with a second party who was currently in my house planting evidence for a future search warrant they were planning to execute once they set me up for the previously defined 2-stroke \u201cemission sticker\u201d setup. Near the end of 2013 I was and still am the the property manager for 656 N. Van Ness, Fresno California, 93728. At that time the property was still vacant. A neighbor had called me to tell me someone was trespassing at the 656 Van Ness address and that she was calling the Police to report it. I live next door at 648 N. Van Ness so I looked out my window and sure enough there was some drugged out looking guy who was on the property checking out the windows and doors. At this point I also called Fresno PD to report the crime in progress. I explained to the police operator or dispatcher that I was the property manager, gave them my name and address and told the operator / dispatcher I wanted the trespasser arrested. From these recorded 911 call records Fresno PD and the Fresno Sheriff\u2019s office gleaned an idea and hatched a plan to send George and Maxine Ramirez dubiously my way as prospective tenants for the purposes of monitoring my detailed movements and reporting this information back to Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel. This \u201cintel\u201d gained from the Ramirez\u2019s would enable Fresno Cops to know exactly when I left my property so they could then gain access to my property for the purposes of illegal entry in order to plant evidence for a future false arrest. I have laid all this out including phone numbers, names, dates, and videos which Fresno PD then buried and falied to further investigate all the evidence I provided in my May of 2015 Fresno PD Interal affairs complaint. The Ramirez\u2019s initially passed my income and rental history checks. Unaware of any criminal record of the Ramirez\u2019s I approved their application and they moved in on 5/31/14. However in mid April of 2015 I discovered the Ramirez\u2019s were police informants who were tasked with watching when I enter and exit my property. Someone had been illegally entering my home, property, and vehicles and I suspected the Ramirez\u2019s along with Fresno Law Enforcement had something to do with it. On the night of 4/11/2015 I confirmed this fact for myself. I have a video documenting this incident on Youtube.\n\n3/05/15 \u2013 A person named Fred calls regarding a repair on a couple of Polaris Jet Ski\u2019s. One ski, the DI (Direct Injection), he states is not legal at Millerton Lake (a state lake here in California that requires and emission sticker for some Jet ski\u2019s that are 2-strokes) but, he states he has fake California emission stickers he found from the Internet that make the ski appear to be smog legal. It\u2019s very strange for someone to volunteer such information about something illegal to a complete stranger. He made an appointment for 3/07/15 to bring in his skis for a repair. After thinking about my discussion with this guy the previous day I decide to call him back to tell him I can\u2019t work on his ski\u2019s because it may be illegal for me to work on Jet Ski\u2019s that have bogus stickers on them. He then said he would remove the stickers. I really didn\u2019t want to work on this persons Jet Ski\u2019s because something was very odd with this situation. I called him early on 3/07/15 to inform him I couldn\u2019t work on his ski\u2019s that day. He called from number 559-289-4263, Voice mail states Crystal Creamery. 3/09/2015 12:54 PM \u2013 559-261-9176. Another suspicious call on a set of 2001 2-stroke Jet Skis. This is an unusual amount of calls on these ski\u2019s. Told him we are no longer working on the 2-strokes because there are bogus emission stickers floating around. I know however these were bogus calls from Fresno Sheriff personnel or associates trying to entrap me into something. After the \u201cFred\u201d incident I started telling callers that requested repairs on 2-stroke Jet Ski\u2019s, that we no longer repair 2-stroke Jet Ski\u2019s. 3/09/2015 4:51 PM \u2013 559-394-3982. Another suspicious 2 stroke Jet ski repair. Told them we no longer work on 2-strokes. 3/09/2015 5:24 PM \u2013 From 559-647-5530. Yet another suspicious 2 stroke Jet ski repair. Told them we no longer work on 2-strokes. Guy called, then passed phone to a Lady. 3/09/2015 7:18 PM \u2013 559-385-3969. This guy initially called on 3/6/15 about a repair on a blown cylinder on a 2-stroke Force outboard motor. I was then contacted via text on 3/09/15 by this same person. He wanted to make arrangements to install his new motor he just purchased and without warning he posted an emission sticker and an engine serial number to my phone. I immediately protested and asked why he posted those items to my phone and I told him not to post that kind of stuff to my phone. This guy was referred to me by Tim Tompsett, a City of Fresno Wastewater division supervisor who became a customer of mine approximately a year earlier. By this time I\u2019d had enough of the emission sticker \u201cstuff\u201d and I immediately confronted Tim with this text message: \u201cTim, I\u2019m not sure why you guys are targeting me. I apologize for the things I commented on in the Fresno Bee. Back in 2009 when this all started I was having trouble in my marriage. Then I was ticketed while at the Home Depot on West Shaw. I later learned that Fresno Law Enforcement was unethically scanning license plates on private parking lots. The added financial stress related to this incident crippled what was left of my marriage. I was devastated, angry, and upset. I thought the parking lot scanning was unfair and simply designed as a Revenue tool for the city of Fresno. So I voiced my opinion on the Fresno Bee, which I now regret. I thought I was anonymous, but an employee at the Bee was feeding Fresno Sheriff personnel chat log data containing ip address information that they used to track down Fresno Citizens who were posting comments critical of Fresno LE and the City of Fresno. Within weeks I was followed by undercover officers who were routinely right down the street from my house. I then commented on the Bee about being followed as well. Then I was starting to get followed by Fresno PD as well. I later learned that other posters were being harassed by Fresno LE as well for their commenting on the Bee. I deeply regret some of the things I said but I never insulted anyone. Everything I stated was true even though it may have been embarrassing for some. Other commenters were rude and directed personal attacks toward the chief and sheriff. I admonished those posters and defended the chief and sheriff on many occasions. Doesn\u2019t this count for anything? Recently I tried to atone by attempting to volunteer some of my free time by signing up for the Citizens on Patrol program but no one called me back. I have a lot of respect for our Chief and I\u2019ve stated this many times. Fresno LE is harassing me daily and I fear Fresno LE folks are trying to set me up for some crime simply because of my opinions. This situation is not just and the impact is very difficult to deal with.\u201d All these \u201cJet Ski folks\u201d were recruited and ready to lie and perjure themselves at the request of the Fresno Sheriff\u2019s Department and the Fresno Police Department. Some are likely criminals who are facing current criminal cases who were willing to trade lies for less Jail time. As was cerntainly the case with George Adams Ramirez who was listed in the Fresno County Megan\u2019s Law website and appeared to be yet unsentanced. And clearly Tim Tompsett had made my acquaintance by no accident. He was part of a larger conspiracy starting over a year earlier involving George and Maxine Rameriz, Fresno PD, Fresno Sheriff\u2019s Department, and one or more City of Fresno employees, and others. The goal? To target one man; John Lang, for his unflattering opinionated views of local government, including Fresno LE activities. The scope, depth, and breadth, of this conspiracy, I believe is unparalleled in recent Fresno history. 3/25/2015 I filled out the \u201cInternal Affairs Bureau Complaint Form\u201d which essentially is a duplicate of what\u2019s described below and sent it via email to Richard Rasmussen of the Office of Independent Review. For a month I hadn\u2019t heard anything back so I followed up with Richard Rasmussen and asked him if there was any progress on my complaint. Two days later I received a phone call from a Sergeant Sean Biggs who in his voice mail stated he was with the Fresno Police Internal Affairs department. He stated he had a few questions for me. I researched Sergeant Biggs on the internet and found he was coming up as a Sergeant in the \u201cregular\u201d police department, not in Internal Affairs. I asked Richard Rasmussen about this situation and he explained to me in an email that \u201cbefore\u201d Internal Affairs received complaints, a designated field person in the \u201cregular\u201d police department \u201cscreens\u201d all complaints, then forwards the complaints onto the Internal Affairs department. I replied back to Richard Rasmussen stating that I thought this was a serious conflict of interest and found it difficult to believe this was the actual process approved by the City Council and the Mayor. I was starting to become very uncomfortable with this \u201ccomplaint\u201d process, but nonetheless, at Richard Rasmussen urging I proceeded to contact Sergeant Biggs. I communicated via email with Sergeant Biggs and asked Sergeant Biggs about the \u201cscreening\u201d as described by Richard Rasmussen. Sergeant Biggs stated that not only was he \u201cscreening\u201d my complaint, but he would also be the one who investigates my complaint for Internal Affairs. I was stunned. I now have my doubts as to weather or not my complaint ever reached the official Fresno Police Internal Affairs department. 4/02/2015 \u2013 Fresno Sheriff personnel or associate checking my driveway then texting a second party, then leaves in a vehicle. These guys monitor and harass me continuously."}, "https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/miss-trans-america-founder-beaten-stabbed-to-death-in-her-home/#click=https://t.co/a8HwD6USue": {"title": "Miss Trans America founder beaten, stabbed to death in her home", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/miss-trans-america-founder-beaten-stabbed-to-death-in-her-home/#click=https://t.co/a8HwD6USue", "text": "NORTH ADAMS, Mass. \u2014 A transgender rights advocate who started a pageant for transgender women in New England was found dead in her home Friday.

Attorneys say the law thwarts accountability.\n\nAfter Graham Dyer died in the custody of Mesquite police in 2013, his parents asked to see their records.\n\nKathy and Robert Dyer received the phone call out of every parent\u2019s nightmares at 3 a.m. on Aug. 14, 2013. A Mesquite police officer was telling them their 18-year-old son, Graham, was in the hospital with a serious head injury. They should come as quickly as possible.\n\nThey sped in the dark south to Dallas from their home on a dirt road outside of Paris, in Northeast Texas, arriving at Baylor University Medical Center at dawn. Graham lay unresponsive in the intensive care unit beneath a bristle of medical tubes and instrumentation.\n\nOutside his room, Kathy recalled, a group of police officers prevented them from entering: \u201cThey said he was in serious trouble \u2014 that he had felony charges for assaulting an officer.\u201d The police told her Graham had been out of his mind on LSD and had bitten one of the officers while they were taking him into custody. He\u2019d seriously injured himself inside the police cruiser as they drove to the jail.\n\nIt seemed improbable the five officers who\u2019d brought him in couldn\u2019t safely subdue Graham. The youngest of the Dyers\u2019 three children was small and slight \u2014 5-foot-4, 110 pounds. He was a skateboarder, not a linebacker.\n\nAs the morning passed, a series of scans showed Graham\u2019s brain activity slowing to a stop. \u201cThe worst day ever,\u201d Kathy said. Their son\u2019s autopsy said he died of self-inflicted head injuries \u2014 an accident, the medical examiner concluded.\n\nEven in the dark days following their son\u2019s death, the Dyers tended to believe the police. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Kathy, a civil engineer, and Robert, a teacher, were solid citizens.\n\nAnd yet, they wondered: What were those marks on his arms \u2014 \u201cchicken feet\u201d scratches, Robert called them. Or what to make of the emergency room doctor\u2019s notes saying it appeared Graham had been the victim of an assault? Seeking answers, the couple asked the Mesquite Police Department for their records of what happened that night.\n\nBut the department refused to release them \u2014 because, its lawyers explained, Texas law said it didn\u2019t have to.\n\nState law says a police agency isn\u2019t required to turn over records for incidents that don\u2019t result in a conviction. Graham, who\u2019d been charged with assaulting a police officer after the confrontation, had died before his case could be litigated. So, the department reasoned, his records were confidential. Asked to weigh in on the dispute, then-Attorney General Greg Abbott agreed the Mesquite police could refuse the Dyers\u2019 request.\n\nOver the next two years, the Dyers would wage an emotionally draining war to pry loose information that might shed light on what had happened to their son that summer evening. And when, thanks only to their persistence and creativity, they finally managed to obtain it, they would discover Graham\u2019s final hours were very different from what the police said had happened.\n\nAt one time, most police records in Texas were considered open to public inspection. Between the writing of the state\u2019s open records act, in 1973, and the mid-1990s, the attorney general issued a string of opinions concluding that, except for an ongoing prosecution in which releasing details might compromise a case, most law enforcement documents were considered public.\n\nIn 1994, however, the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office sued the state to keep private its closed investigative files. In 1996 the Texas Supreme Court agreed with the prosecutors.\n\nWith the status of the law murky, in 1997 Texas lawmakers wrote a new statute. It specifically excluded from public view \u201cinformation that deals with the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime only in relation to an investigation that did not result in conviction or deferred adjudication.\u201d One stated reason was citizen privacy.\n\n\u201cIf there is an investigation about potential criminal wrong-doing and the decision is made that no charges will be filed, the person has some privacy right not to be characterized as a person under investigation,\u201d explained James Hemphill, an Austin lawyer with the firm of Graves Dougherty who represents the American-Statesman on media law and open-records issues.\n\nAnother reason was simply \u201cto try to withhold as many records as possible,\u201d said Joe Larsen, a Houston open records attorney. Added Laura Prather, an Austin attorney who specializes in First Amendment protections: \u201cLaw enforcement has a very powerful lobby.\u201d\n\nSince then, the clause has been used to summarily deny police and prosecution closed-case records from reporters and attorneys. Yet it has also thwarted families such as the Dyers seeking information and, occasionally, legal recourse.\n\nIn March Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso, filed a bill to compel release of police records if, like Graham, the suspect had died; or, even if not, gave his consent to their release. \u201cThe intent of the law was to not interfere with a pending investigation,\u201d said Prather, who promoted the measure for the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t apply if the suspect is dead.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Parents of teen who died in police custody testify for change in law\n\nMoody, a former prosecutor, said he was persuaded to change the law simply because government records should be considered open to public scrutiny unless there is a compelling reason to withhold them. With police reports of deceased subjects, \u201cI don\u2019t see the interest it serves by withholding that,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham\u2019s funeral was attended by 300 people. Afterwards, 100 of his friends went to the Dyers\u2019 house, where they shot off donated fireworks. But the nagging questions returned. \u201cPeople asked us, What killed Graham?\u201d Robert said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t tell them.\u201d\n\nIn written responses to questions, Mesquite spokesman Wayne Larson explained that Texas law allowed the city to withhold records of Graham\u2019s arrest because \u201cthe incident involved another suspect and release of all the information pertaining to this case would have impacted the investigation and prosecution of that other person.\u201d\n\nYet that suspect, one of Graham\u2019s friends who was with him that night, was charged only with public intoxication, a minor case. Larson said Mesquite also was within its rights to withhold the records as it \u201cinvestigated the circumstances resulting in the death of Mr. Dyer while in police custody.\u201d\n\nNeeding another year to fully vest in his pension, Robert returned to his middle school classroom a week later. The school helped by scheduling a planning period at the start of his day, which he used to meet with the school counselor. Robert spent most mornings crying.\n\nKathy had recently retired from a career with the Texas Department of Transportation. When Graham died, she began windsurfing daily in the nearby lakes, even when the temperatures plunged, seeking distraction and moments of tranquility to ease the unrelenting ache of grief.\n\nA problem-solver by nature, she also started contacting lawyers who might be able to help them learn what had happened to Graham. A Paris attorney tried to wrestle the police reports from Mesquite. But he, too, was rebuffed.\n\nWith her hopes dissolving, Kathy was reading online one night when she landed on the FBI\u2019s site. She was surprised to learn the agency would investigate citizen complaints of civil rights abuses. In October 2014 she typed up a letter with what little she knew about Graham\u2019s death and mailed it to the FBI\u2019s Dallas office.\n\nThe agency\u2019s disappointing response arrived three months later. Based on its review, agents said they could not bring a civil rights lawsuit against the Mesquite Police Department on the Dyers\u2019 behalf.\n\nWith the police department still refusing to turn over its records, the couple contacted Fort Worth attorney Susan Hutchison to cobble together a civil rights complaint. Filed in federal district court in Dallas in August 2015, it was based primarily on Graham\u2019s medical records and his friend\u2019s recollections of the night\u2019s events.\n\nIn low moments, Kathy wondered why she bothered: \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get up and go every day, and I was like, What\u2019s the point of that? It\u2019s not going to bring Graham back.\u201d But then she\u2019d remember: \u201cThey\u2019ve got records that tell what happened. They have videos that showed what happened. And we as the parents don\u2019t have a right to see them?\u201d\n\nCivil rights attorneys say that Texas\u2019s unfriendly law enforcement open records law, when combined with recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, create a potent legal Catch-22 that can thwart police accountability.\n\nIn the past, civilians like the Dyer family pursuing excessive force claims filed lawsuits to shake loose documents from law enforcement agencies that might prove their case. Yet a pair of high court opinions handed down over the past decade have required civil rights lawsuits to contain ever-more detailed facts about the alleged violations.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court in recent cases has made it clear that a civil rights claim has to be fairly precise in laying out specific facts outlining cause of action,\u201d said Ranjana Natarajan, director the University of Texas Law School\u2019s civil rights clinic. \u201cYou have to say what happened, who did what.\u201d\n\nThose can be the very same details that Texas\u2019s records laws currently allow police to withhold. The result: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for plaintiffs in civil rights lawsuits, especially when the victim has died, to put together a case,\u201d Natarajan said.\n\nWith Texas law exempting basic police records from release, families and their lawyers often must conduct their own costly investigations into what happened before they even know if a case is worthy of a lawsuit. \u201cA lot of families never even bother filing civil rights lawsuits because they know they\u2019ll never get enough information,\u201d Natarajan said. \u201cSo the courts never hear them.\u201d\n\nAs a result, added Hutchison, police departments \u201cIn effect, have complete immunity and no accountability\u2014at least in Texas.\u201d\n\nLacking specifics from Graham\u2019s police report, U.S. District Judge Jane Boyle dismissed Kathy and Robert\u2019s claims against Mesquite as too vague. \u201cThe Dyers simply have not alleged enough facts to state an excessive force claim,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhich is where the matter might have ended \u2014 if the Dyers themselves hadn\u2019t stumbled across a backdoor way to uncover the details of their son\u2019s death.\n\nAlthough the couple had been disheartened to learn the FBI wouldn\u2019t investigate Graham\u2019s death, it occurred to Kathy: If the federal agency really had looked into the incident, it must have reviewed the Mesquite Police Department\u2019s records. What if she asked the FBI for the information instead of the Texas law enforcement agency?\n\nUsing the federal Freedom of Information Act, in early 2015 Kathy asked the FBI to turn over any records it had accumulated in its investigation of Graham\u2019s death in Mesquite. That fall, police videos of the fatal evening started arriving.\n\nThe FBI had manipulated the digital tapes slightly; the faces of the individual police officers were obscured, and the federal agency had muted the sound. But the images were startlingly clear.\n\nThere was, for example, the image of a Mesquite police officer standing with his foot on Graham\u2019s head.\n\nThere was the image of Graham in the backseat of the police cruiser, his hands and feet bound \u2014 yet also unseatbelted or otherwise restricted \u2014 in obvious distress, hurling himself about the car. And then the ghostly image of a police officer\u2019s hand with a Taser stun gun appearing in the camera frame, shocking Graham on the leg.\n\nAnd then, pushing him on his back and shocking him again \u2014 this time directly, and apparently deliberately, in his testicles. And Graham screaming silently as the electric shock to his genitals appeared to be repeated.\n\n\u201cA Taser was deployed in an effort to control decedent, prevent escape and prevent him from injuring himself,\u201d the city stated in court documents, adding the officer had been aiming for Graham\u2019s leg and it was dark.\n\nBut \u201cIt makes no sense to hurt someone who\u2019s already hurting himself,\u201d said Jerry Staton, a former Austin police officer who trains police departments in use of force and who is consulting on the Dyers\u2019s behalf. Police should have been better protecting Graham, not inflicting pain, he said.\n\nThe videos of Graham as he was delivered to the jail also seemed at odds with the police department\u2019s explanation of what occurred. According to the agency\u2019s in-custody death report, upon arriving at the jail Graham had still needed to be placed in a special restraint chair \u201cuntil the jail personnel noticed he was having labored breathing.\u201d\n\nYet the video the Dyers received from the FBI depicts Graham lying limp on the sally-port floor after being lifted out of the cruiser. As he tries to raise his head, one of the officers pushes it back to the ground.\n\nRecords show it would be more than two hours before an ambulance was called. Larson said the case was never presented to a grand jury, and no officers were disciplined for their conduct.\n\nAt Hutchison\u2019s advice, the Dyers have decided not to view the tapes. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to see that,\u201d Kathy said.\n\nArmed with the new images, however, Hutchison filed a revised complaint in May 2016 alleging the Mesquite police had mistreated Graham. \u201cThe Dyers have made numerous attempts to obtain sufficient information to identify the specific actions of specific Defendants, which the Defendants have thwarted at every turn, refusing to turn over detailed reports, statements and camera footage,\u201d it stated. \u201cHowever, through a Freedom of Information request to the FBI, the Dyers have obtained redacted camera footage and a redacted police report which supply quite a bit of information.\u201d\n\nAs before, the Mesquite Police Department asked to have the lawsuit dismissed. This time, the federal judge reached a different conclusion.\n\nIn January, Boyle wrote: \u201cNow Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, taken as true, allow the Court to plausibly infer that the force used on Graham was objectively unreasonable given his alleged relatively non-threatening behavior.\u201d A month later, she ordered the Mesquite Police Department to turn over its records.\n\nHutchison said the additional information contained more troubling details about Graham\u2019s interaction with the police. Taser records indicated four officers shocked him multiple times, she said. As Graham is being stunned with a Taser in the back seat of the cruiser, one can be heard saying: \u201cMother[expletive], I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d\n\nRobert said his goal for the lawsuit is modest: \u201cI just want them to say they [expletive] up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying doing LSD wasn\u2019t stupid,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cAnd things happen. But this should have never happened.\u201d"}, "http://countercurrentnews.com/2015/10/more-americans-by-police/": {"title": "Police Killed More Americans In 2014 Than All U.S. Mass Shootings Combined", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://countercurrentnews.com/2015/10/more-americans-by-police/", "text": "With another recent mass shooting having taken place last week in Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 such a crisis is the perfect opportunity for the President to yet again stop just short of using the \u201cC-word\u201d \u2013 confiscation. Or \u201cC\u201d for the gun Control he promoted.\n\nBefore any victims were even in the ground, he exploited the tragedy for politicized gun control agendas.\n\nObama is tired of making speeches about mass killings. He\u2019s tired of them. He doesn\u2019t want killings to be the \u201cnew normal.\u201d I agree with the President. Random, mass murder whether by guns, caused by mental illness, or by hatred needs to stop.\n\nTherefore, I took the liberty of finding its biggest source\u2026\n\nIf it\u2019s really true that you\u2019re 9 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than a terrorist \u2013 then we need to have a talk. But where is our speech to address the thousands of Americans executed by police in the last 15 years? Is it not as speech worthy when the number of dead Americans is only 3 per day and is spattered across the country? Victims one by one?\n\nAlthough we aren\u2019t allowed to know the actual number of American citizens killed by police each year, a database has been tracking news stories since 2013.\n\nIn 2014, at least 1,104 Americans were executed on site by law enforcement. No trial \u2013 just violent death. A quick scan of the headlines shows an inordinate amount of shooting deaths. So, the media reports on them, but without the outrage reserved for lone shooters who walk into public places spraying bullets at random people.\n\nNot only do some sources average the deaths out to 3 per day, but also one American every 7.6 hours. That means if you saw this headline before work, and then read the story after you got home from work \u2013 two Americans have likely died at the hands of law enforcement in the meantime.\n\nThe media supports the agenda to remove gun ownership from law abiding citizens because of conveniently timed and fishy looking mass shootings by deranged males \u2013 but not from deranged, gun-wielding males with badges. The ones who may gravitate to such positions, who don\u2019t get screened. Who can simply move to another state or nearby department and restart their law enforcement career after they have killed.\n\nBack to the numbers comparison \u2013 how does the amount of Americans murdered by police in 2014 (and on average every day) compare to the amount of Americans killed in all U.S. mass shootings? (A mass shooting is typically one person, who has randomly killed at least 4 people in a public place within 24 hours. Not to be confused with sprees, serial murders or mass genocide)\n\nIn 2014 police killed about twice the amount of Americans as those killed in all U.S. mass shootings combined, starting in 1982.\n\nThe amount of people killed in all U.S. mass shootings \u2013\n\nThat\u2019s 567 people in 157 shootings starting in the 1980s. In 2014 alone \u2013 in one year flat \u2013 police nearly killed double that amount.\n\nAgain, where are the speeches? Where are the calls for mental health screenings and strict regulations for the authorities? Officers who kill don\u2019t have their three-part name plastered on front pages \u2013 no calls for their guns removed. And when they happen to use one of their \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d weapons \u2013 they kill. When they have only their fists, boots or their arms \u2013 they kill.\n\nThis is precisely why you never, ever give up your Second Amendment \u2013 or your guns. The tragedy argument must always be flipped back to the authorities who want you to be without any defense, against deranged authorities with all the force. Turn. The. Tables.\n\nThe trouble with malleable media statistics and their tunnel vision is \u2013 it\u2019s all pretty, framed lies. Recall when school shootings first took place \u2013 it was reported on daily for what seemed like years until the word \u201cschool\u201d was now associated with \u201cshooting\u201d or gun violence. Of course it has has taken place and is horribly tragic. Nothing discounts that. But it\u2019s a focus redirect for a reaction and controlled outcome. Just think about what now continues to mow down Americans in violence at a most startling rate. Think about how different it would be if the media framed police involved shootings in the same light\u2026they should! It should always be a national tragedy.\n\nAn inordinate amount of shootings took place between 2010-2013. Obama doesn\u2019t even wait for burials anymore before he calls for the removal of guns before hitting the greens again. And if people don\u2019t pay attention and sift through the truth they will find themselves stuttering and speechless when authoritarians \u2013 law enforcement perhaps \u2013 yank guns from their warm, living hands.\n\nTake for instance, the new federal crime unit Chicago called for in the \u201cwake of the 2014 Chicago Easter weekend shootings.\u201d Guns were the boogeymen man in Obama\u2019s old stomping grounds despite the fact that Chicago boasted the strictest gun control laws in the country \u2013 and also surpassed New York City in murder crimes in 2011.\n\nThe media rode the choppy waves of pointing to crime in Chicago as a reason to rid its citizens of guns, but also wanting to showcase a drop in crime to show that strict gun control works. The problem is \u2013 there was no drop in murder. Just a drastic change in how homicides were reported. It\u2019s amazing how much a homicide looks like \u201cdeath from natural causes\u201d when law enforcement deliberately record it that way. Additionally, operations for this federal unit began April 1 \u2013 before Easter. How then could the unit be formed in \u201cthe wake of a shooting\u201d when it happened before the shooting took place? I think you know the answer to that\u2026\n\nAdditionally, the mainstream media is still purse-lipped on the \u201cmass shooting that never was.\u201d The one that was prevented by one responsible person with a gun. In fact, the \u201cnon-event\u201d was lumped in with other shooting stories to showcase \u201cmore gun violence.\u201d (That\u2019s also known as deception.) An off-duty female officer saves the world from another Aurora-type shooting? Normally, that holds all the media-trappings of a heroic cause for celebration. Except when that last slot on the machine doesn\u2019t match the greater agenda of gun control \u2013 then it doesn\u2019t make it past the cutting room floor.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m going to have to side with Obama on this one. Too many killings are taking place \u2013 it cannot be the \u201cnew normal\u201d \u2013 but where, O where, shall we look?\n\nThe Second Amendment is non-negotiable. It has to be, unless the world wants to witness an En Masse shooting here in America like never before. Which is why it was written of course \u2013 the only reason why it was written."}, "https://medium.com/aclu/cia-torture-psychologists-compare-themselves-to-nazi-poison-gas-manufacturer-as-defense-21d64de4f803": {"title": "CIA Torture Psychologists Compare Themselves to Nazi Poison Gas Manufacturer as Defense", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://medium.com/aclu/cia-torture-psychologists-compare-themselves-to-nazi-poison-gas-manufacturer-as-defense-21d64de4f803", "text": "A s the recently departed White House press secretary demonstrated earlier this year, making comparisons to the Nazi regime\u2019s murderous use of poison gas is rarely a good idea. That\u2019s one reason it was so surprising that ahead of a crucial court hearing this week, defense lawyers for the two psychologists behind the CIA\u2019s torture program compared their clients to the contractors who supplied the Nazis with Zyklon B, the poison gas used at Auschwitz and other concentration camps to murder millions of Jews and other prisoners in the Holocaust.\n\nPsychologists James Mitchell and John \u201cBruce\u201d Jessen were the architects of the CIA\u2019s torture program. Now, in a groundbreaking lawsuit, three survivors and victims of the torture program are seeking to hold Mitchell and Jessen accountable.\n\nThis Friday in federal court in Spokane, Washington, Mitchell and Jessen\u2019s lawyers will argue that they can\u2019t be held responsible for their actions. In an extraordinary legal filing, Mitchell and Jessen claim they aren\u2019t legally responsible to the people hurt by their methods because they \u201csimply did business with the CIA pursuant to their contracts.\u201d\n\nA key part of Mitchell and Jessen\u2019s argument hinges on the claim that poison gas manufacturers weren\u2019t held responsible by a British military tribunal for providing the Nazis with the gas because the Nazi government, not contractors, had final say on whether to use it. They argue that they are like a corporate gassing technician who was charged with and acquitted of assisting the Nazis because \u201ceven if [Mitchell and Jessen] played an integral part of the supply and use of\u201d torture methods, they had no \u201cinfluence\u201d over the CIA\u2019s decision to use them and can\u2019t be accountable.\n\nIn fact, the Nuremberg tribunals that judged the Nazis and their enablers after World War II established the opposite rule: Private contractors are accountable when they choose to provide unlawful means and profit from war crimes. In the same case that Mitchell and Jessen cite, the military tribunal found the owner of a chemical company that sold Zyklon B to the Nazis guilty \u2014 even though only the Nazis had final say on which prisoners would be gassed.\n\nThe military tribunal made clear that \u201cknowingly to supply a commodity to a branch of the State which was using that commodity for the mass extermination of Allied civilian nationals was a war crime, and that the people who did it were war criminals for putting the means to commit the crime into the hands of those who actually carried it out.\u201d\n\nThis conclusion applies in our clients\u2019 case, as we explained in a court filing. Mitchell and Jessen came up with the torture methods used at secret CIA prisons, personally tested their methods on the CIA\u2019s first prisoner, and formed a company that took in $81 million in taxpayer money to run the torture program. Making money by choosing to supply the tools for torture isn\u2019t \u201csimply doing business.\u201d It\u2019s illegal.\n\nOur clients Suleiman Abdullah Salim, Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, and the family of Gul Rahman will be taking a historic step to seek justice from the psychologists. It\u2019s the first time victims of CIA torture have ever made it this far past the many obstacles that doomed previous lawsuits even before they got underway.\n\nHaving failed in two previous attempts to shut down the lawsuit against them, Mitchell and Jessen are now also making one last effort to avoid a trial \u2014 presently scheduled for early September \u2014 for their actions. The two psychologists will argue again that no court has the power to judge them, and that they\u2019re immune from having to account for the profits they made.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve previously pointed out, torture isn\u2019t a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a war crime. And it is a legal and moral imperative to hold accountable those responsible for torturing in our name."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/california-police-white-supremacists-counter-protest?CMP=share_btn_tw": {"title": "California police worked with neo-Nazis to pursue 'anti-racist' activists, documents show", "keywords": ["The far right", "California", "Activism", "US news", "Protest", "US policing"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/california-police-white-supremacists-counter-protest?CMP=share_btn_tw", "text": "California police investigating a violent white nationalist event worked with white supremacists in an effort to identify counter-protesters and sought the prosecution of activists with \u201canti-racist\u201d beliefs, court documents show.\n\nThe records, which also showed officers expressing sympathy with white supremacists and trying to protect a neo-Nazi organizer\u2019s identity, were included in a court briefing from three anti-fascist activists who were charged with felonies after protesting at a Sacramento rally. The defendants were urging a judge to dismiss their case and accused California police and prosecutors of a \u201ccover-up and collusion with the fascists\u201d.\n\nDefense lawyers said the case at the state capital offers the latest example of US law enforcement appearing to align with neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups while targeting anti-fascist activists and Donald Trump protesters after violent clashes.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking and really angering to see the level of collusion and the amount to which the police covered up for the Nazis,\u201d said Yvette Felarca, a Berkeley teacher and anti-fascist organizer charged with assault and rioting after participating in the June 2016 Sacramento rally, where she said she was stabbed and bludgeoned in the head. \u201cThe people who were victimized by the Nazis were then victimized by the police and the district attorneys.\u201d\n\nSteve Grippi, chief deputy district attorney prosecuting the case in Sacramento, vehemently denied the claims of bias in an email to the Guardian, alleging that anti-fascist stabbing victims have been uncooperative and noting that his office has filed charges against one member of the Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP), the neo-Nazi group that organized the rally.\n\nSome California highway patrol (CHP) investigation records, however, raise questions about the police\u2019s investigative tactics and communication with the TWP.\n\nFelarca\u2019s attorneys obtained numerous examples of CHP officers working directly with the TWP, often treating the white nationalist group as victims and the anti-fascists as suspects.\n\nThe TWP is \u201cintimately allied with neo-Nazi and other hardline racist organizations\u201d and \u201cadvocates for racially pure nations\u201d, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Its leaders have praised Trump, and the group claimed to bring more than 100 people to the Charlottesville white supremacist rally, where a counter-protester was killed.\n\nIn one phone call with Doug McCormack, identified by police as the TWP affiliate who acquired the permit for the Sacramento rally, CHP investigator Donovan Ayres warned him that police might have to release his name in response to a public records requests. The officer said he would try to protect McCormack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna suggest that we hold that or redact your name or something until this gets resolved,\u201d Ayres told McCormack, adding that he didn\u2019t know who had requested records of the permit and noting, \u201cIf I did, I would tell you.\u201d\n\nAyres\u2019s reports noted that McCormack was armed at the rally with a knife.\n\nThe officer\u2019s write-up about an African American anti-fascist activist included a photo of him at the hospital after the rally and noted that he had been stabbed in the abdomen, chest and hand.\n\nAyres, however, treated the protester like a suspect in the investigation. The police investigator recommended the man be charged with 11 offenses, including disturbing the peace, conspiracy, assault, unlawful assembly and wearing a mask to evade police.\n\nAs evidence, Ayres provided Facebook photos of the man holding up his fist. The officer wrote that the man\u2019s \u201cBlack Power salute\u201d and his \u201csupport for anti-racist activism\u201d demonstrated his \u201cintent and motivation to violate the civil rights\u201d of the neo-Nazi group. He was ultimately not charged.\n\nAyres\u2019s report also noted Felarca\u2019s political activism in great detail, referencing her activism on behalf of students of color and women\u2019s rights protests.\n\n\u201cThis is a textbook case of a political witch-hunt and selective prosecution,\u201d Shanta Driver, one of Felarca\u2019s attorneys, said in an interview.\n\nOfficers also worked with TWP member Derik Punneo to try to identify anti-fascist activists, recordings revealed. Officers interviewed Punneo in jail after he was arrested for an unrelated domestic violence charge. Audio recordings captured investigators saying they brought photos to show him, hoping he could help them identify anti-fascist activists.\n\nThe officers said, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much going after them,\u201d and assured him: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at you as a victim.\u201d\n\nAyres\u2019s report noted that Punneo was armed with a knife at the neo-Nazi rally and that one stabbing victim told officers he believed Punneo was responsible. Using video footage, Ayres also noted that Punneo was \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of another victim at the time he was injured, but the officer said the evidence ultimately wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nPunneo and McCormack, who could not be reached for comment, were not charged. Ayres\u2019s report included images and names of three other TWP-affiliated men who he said were armed with knives, but who also have faced no charges.\n\nIn a response filed on Thursday, prosecutors said \u201cevery assertion\u201d in the motion to dismiss is \u201cinaccurate or fabricated\u201d and accused Felarca\u2019s lawyers of using the filing to \u201cmake a political statement\u201d. The response also repeatedly blamed the stabbing victims for ignoring the district attorney\u2019s inquiries: \u201cDespite the fact that we have not gained the cooperation of these victims, the investigation to hold their attackers responsible continues forward.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also said the charges were based on video evidence and argued that \u201cno one is beneath the protection of the law, no matter how repugnant his or her rhetoric or misguided his or her ideals\u201d.\n\nAllegations of police bias and collusion with neo-Nazis have emerged in similar cases across the US. Last year, US prosecutors targeting anti-Trump protesters in Washington DC relied on video evidence from a far-right group with a record of deceptive tactics.\n\nAt an Oregon \u201calt-right\u201d event, police allowed a member of a rightwing militia-style group to help officers arrest an anti-fascist activist.\n\nPolice in Charlottesville were widely accused of standing by as Nazis attacked protesters, and a black man who was badly beaten by white supremacists was later charged with a felony.\n\nSam Menefee-Libey, an activist who advocated for protesters charged for Inauguration Day rallies last year, said the government has repeatedly gone to great lengths to target anti-fascists: \u201cWe have patterns of acknowledged and unacknowledged overlaps between the interest of ultra-right nationalist organizations and the police and prosecutors\u2019 offices.\u201d"}, "http://thoughtcatalog.com/jacob-geers/2015/07/new-york-paramedic-who-makes-15-an-hour-tells-the-world-exactly-what-he-thinks-about-fast-food-workers-earning-the-same/": {"title": "Paramedic Who Makes $15 An Hour Tells The World EXACTLY What He Thinks About Fast Food Workers Earning The Same", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://thoughtcatalog.com/jacob-geers/2015/07/new-york-paramedic-who-makes-15-an-hour-tells-the-world-exactly-what-he-thinks-about-fast-food-workers-earning-the-same/", "text": "New York is planning to incrementally raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for all fast food employees.

Among the concerns are his repeated assertions that he would have won the popular vote had 3 to 5 million \u201cillegals\u201d not voted in the 2016 election, a claim echoed by the head of a White House advisory committee on voter fraud.\n\nClaims of large-scale voter fraud are not true, but that has not stopped a substantial number of Republicans from believing them. But how far would Republicans be willing to follow the president to stop what they perceive as rampant fraud? Our recent survey suggests that the answer is quite far: About half of Republicans say they would support postponing the 2020 presidential election until the country can fix this problem.\n\n[Here\u2019s a voter fraud myth: Richard Daley \u2018stole\u2019 Illinois for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 election]\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research:\n\nThe survey interviewed a sample of 1,325 Americans from June 5 through 20. Respondents were recruited from the Qualtrics online panel who had previously reported identifying with or leaning toward one of the two major parties. We focus on the 650 respondents who identify with or lean toward the Republican Party. The sample has been weighted to match the population in terms of sex, age, race and education.\n\nAfter a series of initial questions, respondents were asked whether Trump won the popular vote, whether millions of illegal immigrants voted, and how often voter fraud occurs. These questions evoke arguments frequently made by Trump and others about the integrity of the 2016 election.\n\nThen the survey asked two questions about postponing the 2020 election.\n\nRoughly half of Republicans believe Trump won the popular vote \u2014 and would support postponing the 2020 election.\n\nNearly half of Republicans (47 percent) believe that Trump won the popular vote, which is similar to this finding. Larger fractions believe that millions of illegal immigrants voted (68 percent) and that voter fraud happens somewhat or very often (73 percent). Again, this is similar to previous polls.\n\nMoreover, 52 percent said that they would support postponing the 2020 election, and 56 percent said they would do so if both Trump and Republicans in Congress proposed this.\n\n[What if Pence\u2019s voter fraud commission \u2018finds\u2019 thousands of duplicate registrations? They will. Here\u2019s why.]\n\nNot surprisingly, beliefs about the 2016 election and voter fraud were correlated with support for postponement. People who believed that Trump won the popular vote, that there were millions of illegal votes in 2016, or that voter fraud is not rare were more likely to support postponing the election. This support was also more prevalent among Republicans who were younger, were less educated, had less factual knowledge of politics and strongly identified with the party.\n\nOf course, this is still hypothetical.\n\nOf course, our survey is only measuring reactions to a hypothetical situation. Were Trump to seriously propose postponing the election, there would be a torrent of opposition, which would most likely include prominent Republicans. Financial markets would presumably react negatively to the potential for political instability. And this is to say nothing of the various legal and constitutional complications that would immediately become clear. Citizens would almost certainly form their opinions amid such tumult, which does not at all resemble the context in which our survey was conducted.\n\n[Is democracy on the decline? Not as much as some pundits want you to believe]\n\nNevertheless, we do not believe that these findings can be dismissed out of hand. At a minimum, they show that a substantial number of Republicans are amenable to violations of democratic norms that are more flagrant than what is typically proposed (or studied). And although the ensuing chaos could turn more Republicans against this kind of proposal, it is also conceivable that a high-stakes and polarized debate would do the exact opposite.\n\nPostponing the 2020 presidential election is not something that Trump or anyone in his administration has even hinted at, but for many in his constituency, floating such an idea may not be a step too far.\n\nAriel Malka is an associate professor of psychology at Yeshiva University.\n\nYphtach Lelkes is an assistant professor in the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania."}, "http://evonomics.com/why-garbage-men-should-earn-more-than-bankers/": {"title": "Why Garbagemen Should Earn More Than Bankers", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://evonomics.com/why-garbage-men-should-earn-more-than-bankers/", "text": "Thick fog envelops City Hall Park at daybreak on February 2, 1968. Seven thousand New York City sanitation workers stand crowded together, their mood rebellious. Union spokesman John DeLury addresses the multitude from the roof of a truck. When he announces that the mayor has refused further concessions, the crowd\u2019s anger threatens to boil over. As the first rotten eggs sail overhead, DeLury realizes the time for compromise is over. It\u2019s time to take the illegal route, the path prohibited to sanitation workers for the simple reason that the job they do is too important.\n\nThe next day, trash goes uncollected throughout the Big Apple. Nearly all the city\u2019s garbage crews have stayed home. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had prestige, and it never bothered me before,\u201d one garbageman is quoted in a local newspaper. \u201cBut it does now. People treat us like dirt.\u201d\n\nGet Evonomics in your inbox\n\nWhen the mayor goes out to survey the situation two days later, the city is already knee-deep in refuse, with another 10,000 tons added every day. A rank stench begins to percolate through the city\u2019s streets, and rats have been sighted in even the swankiest parts of town. In the space of just a few days, one of the world\u2019s most iconic cities has started to look like a slum. And for the first time since the polio epidemic of 1931, city authorities declare a state of emergency.\n\nStill the mayor refuses to budge. He has the local press on his side, which portrays the strikers as greedy narcissists. It takes a week before the realization begins to kick in: The garbagemen are actually going to win. \u201cNew York is helpless before them,\u201d the editors of The New York Times despair. \u201cThis greatest of cities must surrender or see itself sink in filth.\u201d Nine days into the strike, when the trash has piled up to 100,000 tons, the sanitation workers get their way. \u201cThe moral of the story,\u201d Time Magazine later reported, \u201cis that it pays to strike.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, but not in every profession.\n\nImagine, for instance, that all of Washington\u2019s 100,000 lobbyists were to go on strike tomorrow. Or that every tax accountant in Manhattan decided to stay home. It seems unlikely the mayor would announce a state of emergency. In fact, it\u2019s unlikely that either of these scenarios would do much damage. A strike by, say, social media consultants, telemarketers, or high-frequency traders might never even make the news at all.\n\nWhen it comes to garbage collectors, though, it\u2019s different. Any way you look at it, they do a job we can\u2019t do without. And the harsh truth is that an increasing number of people do jobs that we can do just fine without. Were they to suddenly stop working the world wouldn\u2019t get any poorer, uglier, or in any way worse. Take the slick Wall Street traders who line their pockets at the expense of another retirement fund. Take the shrewd lawyers who can draw a corporate lawsuit out until the end of days. Or take the brilliant ad writer who pens the slogan of the year and puts the competition right out of business.\n\nInstead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no clear line between who creates wealth and who shifts it. Lots of jobs do both. There\u2019s no denying that the financial sector can contribute to our wealth and grease the wheels of other sectors in the process. Banks can help to spread risks and back people with bright ideas. And yet, these days, banks have become so big that much of what they do is merely shuffle wealth around, or even destroy it. Instead of growing the pie, the explosive expansion of the banking sector has increased the share it serves itself.\n\nOr take the legal profession. It goes without saying that the rule of law is necessary for a country to prosper. But now that the U.S. has 17 times the number of lawyers per capita as Japan, does that make American rule of law 17 times as effective? Or Americans 17 times as protected? Far from it. Some law firms even make a practice of buying up patents for products they have no intention of producing, purely to enable them to sue people for copyright infringement.\n\nBizarrely, it\u2019s precisely the jobs that shift money around \u2013 creating next to nothing of tangible value \u2013 that net the best salaries. It\u2019s a fascinating, paradoxical state of affairs. How is it possible that all those agents of prosperity \u2013 the teachers, the police officers, the nurses \u2013 are paid so poorly, while the unimportant, superfluous, and even destructive shifters do so well?\n\nWhen Idleness was Still a Birthright\n\nMaybe history can shed some light on this conundrum.\n\nUp until a few centuries ago, almost everybody worked in agriculture. That left an affluent upper class free to loaf around, live off their private assets, and wage war \u2013 all hobbies that don\u2019t create wealth but at best shift it about, or at worst destroy it. Any blue-blooded noble was proud of this lifestyle, which gave the happy few the hereditary right to line their pockets at the expense of others. Work? That was for peasants.\n\nIn those days, before the Industrial Revolution, a farmers\u2019 strike would have paralyzed the entire economy. These days, all the graphs, diagrams, and pie charts suggest that everything has changed. As a portion of the economy, agriculture seems marginal. Indeed, the U.S. financial sector is seven times as large as its agricultural sector.\n\nSo, does this mean that if farmers were to stage a strike, it would put us in less of a bind than a boycott by bankers? (No, quite the reverse.) And, besides, hasn\u2019t agricultural production actually soared in recent decades? (Certainly.) Well then, aren\u2019t farmers earning more than ever? (Sadly, no.)\n\nYou see, in a market economy, things work precisely the other way around. The larger the supply, the lower the price. And there\u2019s the rub. Over the last few decades, the supply of food has skyrocketed. In 2010, American cows produced twice as much milk as they did in 1970. Over that same period, the productivity of wheat has also doubled, and that of tomatoes has tripled. The better agriculture has become, the less we\u2019re willing to pay for it. These days, the food on our plates has become dirt cheap.\n\nThis is what economic progress is all about. As our farms and factories grew more efficient, they accounted for a shrinking share of our economy. And the more productive agriculture and manufacturing became, the fewer people they employed. At the same time, this shift generated more work in the service sector. Yet before we could get ourselves a job in this new world of consultants, chefs, accountants, programmers, advisors, brokers, doctors, and lawyers, we first had to earn the proper credentials.\n\nIronically, however, it has also created a system in which an increasing number of people can earn money without contributing anything of tangible value to society. Call it the paradox of progress: Here in the Land of Plenty, the richer and the smarter we get, the more expendable we become.\n\nOn May 4, 1970, this notice ran in the Irish Independent. After lengthy but fruitless negotiations over wages that had failed to keep pace with inflation, Ireland\u2019s bank employees decided to go on strike.\n\nOvernight, 85% of the country\u2019s reserves were locked down. With all indications suggesting that the strike could last a while, businesses across Ireland began to hoard cash. Two weeks into the strike, The Irish Times reported that half of the country\u2019s 7,000 bankers had already booked flights to London in search of other work.\n\nAt the outset, pundits predicted that life in Ireland would come to a standstill. First, cash supplies would dry up, then trade would stagnate, and finally unemployment would explode. \u201cImagine all the veins in your body suddenly shrinking and collapsing,\u201d one economist described the prevailing fear, \u201cand you might begin to see how economists conceive of banking shutdowns.\u201d Heading into the summer of 1970, Ireland braced itself for the worst.\n\nAnd then something odd happened. Or more accurately, nothing much happened at all.\n\nIn July, the The Times of England reported that the \u201cfigures and trends which are available indicate that the dispute has not had an adverse effect on the economy so far.\u201d A few months later, the Central Bank of Ireland drew up the final balance. \u201cThe Irish economy continued to function for a reasonably long period of time with its main clearing banks closed for business,\u201d it concluded. Not only that, the economy had continued to grow.\n\nIn the end, the strike would last a whole six months \u2013 20 times as long as the New York City sanitation workers\u2019 strike. But whereas across the pond a state of emergency had been declared after just six days, Ireland was still going strong after six months without bankers. \u201cThe main reason I cannot recollect much about the bank strike,\u201d an Irish journalist reflected in 2013, \u201cwas because it did not have a debilitating impact on daily life.\u201d\n\nBut without bankers, what did they do for money?\n\nSomething quite simple: The Irish started issuing their own cash. After the bank closures, they continued writing checks to one another as usual, the only difference being that they could no longer be cashed at the bank. Instead, that other dealer in liquid assets \u2013 the Irish pub \u2013 stepped in to fill the void. At a time when the Irish still stopped for a pint at their local pub at least three times a week, everyone \u2013 and especially the bartender \u2013 had a pretty good idea who could be trusted. \u201cThe managers of these retail outlets and public houses had a high degree of information about their customers,\u201d explains the economist Antoin Murphy. \u201cOne does not after all serve drink to someone for years without discovering something of his liquid resources.\u201d\n\nIn no time, people forged a radically decentralized monetary system with the country\u2019s 11,000 pubs as its key nodes and basic trust as its underlying mechanism. By the time the banks finally reopened in November, the Irish had printed an incredible \u00a35 billion in homemade currency. Some checks had been issued by companies, others were scribbled on the backs of cigar boxes, or even on toilet paper. According to historians, the reason the Irish were able to manage so well without banks was all down to social cohesion.\n\nSo were there no problems at all?\n\nNo, of course there were problems. Take the guy who bought a racehorse on credit and then paid the debt with money he won when his horse came in first \u2013 basically, gambling with another person\u2019s cash. It sounds an awful lot like what banks do now, but then on a smaller scale. And, during the strike, Irish companies had a harder time acquiring capital for big investments. Indeed, the very fact that people began do-it-yourself banking makes it patently clear that they couldn\u2019t do without some kind of financial sector.\n\nBut what they could do perfectly well without was all the smoke and mirrors, all the risky speculation, the glittering skyscrapers, and the towering bonuses paid out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets. \u201cMaybe, just maybe,\u201d the author and economist Umair Haque conjectures, \u201cbanks need people a lot more than people need banks.\u201d\n\nWhat a contrast with that other strike two years earlier and 3,000 miles away. Where New Yorkers had looked on in desperation as their city deteriorated into a garbage dump, the Irish became their own bankers. Where New York was staring into the abyss after just six days, in Ireland things were still going swimmingly even after six months.\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight, however. Making money without creating anything of value is anything but easy. It takes talent, ambition, and brains. And the banking world is brimming with clever minds. \u201cThe genius of the great speculative investors is to see what others do not, or to see it earlier,\u201d explains the economist Roger Bootle. \u201cThis is a skill. But so is the ability to stand on tiptoe, balancing on one leg, while holding a pot of tea above your head, without spillage.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the fact that something is difficult does not automatically make it valuable.\n\nIn recent decades those clever minds have concocted all manner of complex financial products that don\u2019t create wealth, but destroy it. These products are, essentially, like a tax on the rest of the population. Who do you think is paying for all those custom-tailored suits, mansions, and luxury yachts? If bankers aren\u2019t generating the underlying value themselves, then it has to come from somewhere \u2013 or someone \u2013 else. The government isn\u2019t the only one redistributing wealth. The financial sector does it, too, but without a democratic mandate.\n\nThe bottom line is that wealth can be concentrated somewhere, but that doesn\u2019t also mean that\u2019s where it\u2019s being created. This is just as true for your former feudal landowner as it is for the current CEO of Goldman Sachs. The only difference is that bankers sometimes have a momentary lapse and imagine themselves the great creators of all this wealth. The lord who was proud to live off his peasants\u2019 labor suffered no such delusions.\n\nAnd to think that things could have been so different.\n\nNearly a century ago, economist John Maynard Keynes famously predicted that we would work fifteen-hour weeks by the year 2030. He thought that our wealth and prosperity would increase dramatically and that we would convert much of that wealth into leisure. Keynes was certainly not the only one to believe that it was just a matter of time before we solved the \u201ceconomic problem.\u201d Well into the 1970s, economists and sociologists forecasted that \u201cthe End of Work\u201d was near.\n\nIn reality, that\u2019s not at all what has happened. We\u2019re plenty more prosperous, but we\u2019re not exactly swimming in a sea of free time. Quite the reverse. We\u2019re all working harder than ever. Many people explain these circumstances by assuming we use money we don\u2019t have to buy stuff we don\u2019t need to impress people we don\u2019t like. In other words: we sacrificed our free time on the altar of consumerism.\n\nBut there\u2019s one puzzle piece that doesn\u2019t fit. Most people play no part in the production of iPhone cases in their panoply of colors, exotic shampoos containing botanical extracts, or Mocha Cookie Crumble Frappuccinos. Our addiction to consumption is enabled mostly by robots and Third World wage slaves. And although agricultural and manufacturing production capacity have grown exponentially over the past decades, employment in these industries has dropped. So is it really true that our overworked lifestyle all comes down to out-of-control consumerism?\n\nDavid Graeber, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, believes there\u2019s something else going on. A few years ago he wrote a fascinating piece that pinned the blame not on the stuff we buy but on the work we do. It is titled, aptly, \u201cOn the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs.\u201d\n\nIn Graeber\u2019s analysis, innumerable people spend their entire working lives doing jobs they consider to be pointless, jobs like telemarketer, HR manager, social media strategist, PR advisor, and a whole host of administrative positions at hospitals, universities, and government offices. \u201cBullshit jobs,\u201d Graeber calls them. They\u2019re the jobs that even the people doing them admit are, in essence, superfluous.\n\nWhen I first wrote an article about this phenomenon, it unleashed a small flood of confessions. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d prefer to do something that\u2019s genuinely useful,\u201d responded one stockbroker, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t handle the pay cut.\u201d He also described his \u201camazingly talented former classmate with a Ph.D. in physics\u201d who develops cancer detection technologies, and \u201cearns so much less than me it\u2019s depressing.\u201d But of course, that your work happens to serve a weighty public interest and requires lots of talent, intelligence, and perseverance doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019re raking in the cash.\n\nOr vice versa. Is it any coincidence that the proliferation of well-paid bullshit jobs has coincided with a huge boom in higher education and an economy that revolves around knowledge? Remember, making money without creating anything of value isn\u2019t easy. For starters, you have to memorize some very important-sounding but meaningless jargon. (Crucial when attending strategic trans-sector peer-to-peer meetings to brainstorm the value add-on co-creation in the network society.) Almost anybody can collect trash, but a career in banking is reserved for a select few.\n\nIn a world that\u2019s getting ever richer, where cows produce more milk and robots produce more stuff, there\u2019s more room for friends, family, community service, science, art, sports, and all the other things that make life worthwhile. But there\u2019s also more room for bullshit. As long as we continue to be obsessed with work, work, and more work (even as useful activities are further automated or outsourced), the number of superfluous jobs will only continue to grow. Much like the number of managers in the developed world, which has grown over the last 30 years without making us a dime richer. On the contrary, studies show that countries with more managers are actually less productive and innovative. In a survey of 12,000 professionals by the Harvard Business Review, half said they felt their job had no \u201cmeaning and significance,\u201d and an equal number were unable to relate to their company\u2019s mission. Another recent poll revealed that as many as 37% of British workers think they have a bullshit job.\n\nBy no means are all these new service sector jobs pointless \u2013 far from it. Look at healthcare, education, fire services, and the police and you\u2019ll find lots of people who go home every day knowing, despite their modest paychecks, they\u2019ve made the world a better place. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they are being told,\u201d Graeber writes, \u201cYou get to have real jobs! And on top of that you have the nerve to also expect middle-class pensions and health care?\u201d\n\nThere is Another Way\n\nWhat makes all this especially shocking is that it\u2019s happening in a capitalist system, a system founded on capitalist values like efficiency and productivity. While politicians endlessly stress the need to downsize government, they remain largely silent as the number of bullshit jobs goes right on growing. This results in scenarios where, on the one hand, governments cut back on useful jobs in sectors like healthcare, education, and infrastructure \u2013 resulting in unemployment \u2013 while on the other investing millions in the unemployment industry of training and surveillance whose effectiveness has long been disproven.\n\nThe modern marketplace is equally uninterested in usefulness, quality, and innovation. All that really matters is profit. Sometimes that leads to marvelous contributions, sometimes not. From telemarketers to tax consultants, there\u2019s a rock-solid rationale for creating one bullshit job after another: You can net a fortune without ever producing a thing.\n\nIn this situation, inequality only exacerbates the problem. The more wealth is concentrated at the top, the greater the demand for corporate attorneys, lobbyists, and high-frequency traders. Demand doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, after all; it\u2019s the product of a constant negotiation, determined by a country\u2019s laws and institutions, and, of course, by the people who control the purse strings.\n\nMaybe this is also a clue as to why the innovations of the past 30 years \u2013 a time of spiraling inequality \u2013 haven\u2019t quite lived up to our expectations. \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,\u201d mocks Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley\u2019s resident intellectual. If the postwar era gave us fabulous inventions like the washing machine, the refrigerator, the space shuttle, and the pill, lately it\u2019s been slightly improved iterations of the same phone we bought a couple years ago.\n\nIn fact, it has become increasingly profitable not to innovate. Imagine just how much progress we\u2019ve missed out on because thousands of bright minds have frittered away their time dreaming up hypercomplex financial products that are ultimately only destructive. Or spent the best years of their lives duplicating existing pharmaceuticals in a way that\u2019s infinitesimally different enough to warrant a new patent application by a brainy lawyer so a brilliant PR department can launch a brand-new marketing campaign for the not-so-brand-new drug.\n\nImagine that all this talent were to be invested not in shifting wealth around, but in creating it. Who knows, we might already have had jetpacks, built submarine cities, or cured cancer.\n\nFriedrich Engels, a close friend of Karl Marx, described the \u201cfalse consciousness\u201d to which the working classes of his day \u2013 the \u201cproletariat\u201d \u2013 had fallen victim. According to Engels, the 19th-century factory worker didn\u2019t rise up against the landed elite because his worldview was clouded by religion and nationalism. Maybe society is stuck in a comparable rut today, except this time at the very top of the pyramid. Maybe some of those people have had their vision clouded by all the zeros on their paychecks, the hefty bonuses, and the cushy retirement plans. Maybe a fat billfold triggers a similar false consciousness: the conviction that you\u2019re producing something of great value because you earn so much.\n\nWhatever the case, the way things are is not the way they have to be. Our economy, our taxes, and our universities can all be reinvented to make real innovation and creativity pay off. \u201cWe do not have to wait patiently for slow cultural change,\u201d the maverick economist William Baumol challenged more than 20 years ago. We don\u2019t have to wait until gambling with other people\u2019s money is no longer profitable; until sanitation workers, police agents, and nurses earn a decent wage; and until math whizzes once again start dreaming of building colonies on Mars instead of starting their own hedge funds.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s not the market or technology that decides what has real value, but society. If we want this century to be one in which all of us get richer, then we\u2019ll need to free ourselves of the dogma that all work is meaningful. And, while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s also get rid of the fallacy that a higher salary is automatically a reflection of societal value.\n\nThen we might realize that in terms of value creation, it just doesn\u2019t pay to be a banker.\n\nHalf a century after the strike, the Big Apple seems to have learned its lesson. \u201cEveryone in NYC wants to be garbage collector,\u201d read a recent newspaper headline. These days, the people who pick up after the megacity earn an enviable salary. After five years on the payroll, they can take home as much as $70,000 plus overtime and perks. \u201cThey keep the city running,\u201d a Sanitation Department spokesperson explained in the article. \u201cIf they were to stop working, however briefly, all of New York City would come to a standstill.\u201d\n\nThe paper also interviewed a city sanitation worker. In 2006, Joseph Lerman, then 20, got a call from the city informing him he could report for duty as a collector. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d won the jackpot,\u201d he recounts. Nowadays, Lerman gets up at 4 a.m. every morning to haul garbage bags for shifts of up to 12 hours. To his fellow New Yorkers, it\u2019s only logical that he is well paid for his labors. \u201cHonest,\u201d the city spokesperson smiles, \u201cthese men and women aren\u2019t known as the heroes of New York City for nothing.\u201d\n\nThis essay is adapted from Utopia for Realists: The Case for a Universal Basic Income, Open Borders, and a 15-Hour Workweek by Rutger Bregman.

As Maria McFarland S\u00e1nchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said:\n\nJeff Sessions' obsession with marijuana prohibition defies logic, threatens successful state-level reforms and flies in the face of widespread public support for legalization. Rescinding the Cole memo is not just an attack on sensible marijuana polices--it's an attack on civil and human rights. Police have long relied on the suspicion of minor marijuana offenses to profile, harass, arrest and even lock up massive numbers of people, especially in communities of color. We can't stand by and let the drug war be used as a tool to harm vulnerable communities or to deport and destroy families.\n\nTHE \"PRINCIPLES\" alluded to by Sessions include the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, a product of the \"war on drugs\" initiated by Richard Nixon. In 1994, Nixon's domestic policy advisor John Ehrlichman candidly admitted the racist roots of Nixon's crusade to Dan Baum of Harper's Magazine:\n\nYou want to know what this was really all about? The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\n\nArrests for small-scale possession and distribution of pot have been the leading edge of drug enforcement ever since, which, in combination with the mandatory minimum sentencing laws created by Bill Clinton's two crime bills, created the system of mass incarceration under which people of color and the poor have been disproportionately pushed into an overpopulated prison system.\n\nThe U.S. still has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and 57 percent of those in prison for drug offenses are Black or Latino--even though white people use and sell drugs at similar rates.\n\nAll of this has come at a tremendous cost, not only in lives ruined, but in taking money away from social programs that can help people live stable and healthy lives. The U.S. spends more than $50 billion a year on the drug war--far more than the entire $38.8 billion budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBut the tide has been turning against these policies. 2016 saw a record number of measures to legalize or decriminalize marijuana. Voters across the country rejoiced when Maine, Massachusetts and California legalized recreational marijuana, while five other states--Arkansas, Florida, Montana, Nevada and North Dakota--legalized medical marijuana use.\n\nMarijuana legalization is more popular than it has ever been, with a recent Gallup poll finding it favored by 64 percent of Americans.\n\nTHE \"GROWING drug crisis\" Sessions lectured about has nothing to do with marijuana legalization and everything to do with how our society treats addiction and mental health in general and regulates our access to health care, housing and food.\n\nAs Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, pointed out in a 2014 interview with Frontline,\n\nDrug abuse and drug addiction is not unique to poor communities of color. It is like this everywhere in America, but how we respond to drug abuse and drug addiction in poor communities of color is radically different than how we respond to it in more privileged communities.... People in [poor] communities have little choice but to self-medicate, and when they do, when they decide to turn to marijuana or turn to cocaine or turn to some type of substance we've designed, we've decided is prohibited, is off-limits, then rather than responding to these people with drug treatment and say[ing], \"How can we help you cope with your crisis and help you through this period of time and help you deal with your drug addiction?\" instead we say: \"Oh, the answer for you is a cage.\"... That's our answer to drug abuse and drug addiction in these communities. If we really cared about people who lived there, would that be our answer? I think not. I think the way in which we respond to drug abuse and drug addiction in these communities speaks volumes about the extent to which these are people we truly care about.\n\nThere are ongoing debates and critiques about whether legalization and regulation have done more to benefit cannabis businesses than individuals who gain new access to marijuana. But there is no credible defense for the racism at the heart of the \"war on drugs\" and the U.S. criminal justice system.\n\nNo matter how you read the pot leaves say about the future of the marijuana market, one thing is certain. It will take large-scale protests to make Sessions and his fellow drug warriors afraid again. And it will require a movement that puts the fight against racism front and center to successfully fight for access to health care and decriminalization to turn the tide on mass incarceration and drug addiction.\n\nThe \"war on drugs\" doesn't work, and it will require strategies based on solidarity and liberation to take up the calls to put an end to it. As the Drug Policy Alliance urges, \"It's time for a new approach grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights.\""}, "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-italy-strike/workers-at-amazons-main-italian-hub-german-warehouses-strike-on-black-friday-idUSKBN1DN1DS": {"title": "Workers at Amazon's main Italian hub, German warehouses strike on...", "keywords": ["Germany", "Italy", "United States", "Stefanie Nutzenberger", "US", "AMAZON", "ITALY", "STRIKE", "Germany", "Labour Disputes", "Company News", "Western Europe", "Italy", "Corporate Events", "Government Borrowing Requirement", "Internet / World Wide Web", "Europe", "Science", "Department Stores (TRBC)", "United Kingdom", "Labour / Personnel", "United States"], "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-italy-strike/workers-at-amazons-main-italian-hub-german-warehouses-strike-on-black-friday-idUSKBN1DN1DS", "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Workers at Amazon\u2019s main distribution hub in Italy are planning their first ever strike for Friday, trade unions said, while they are also striking at six warehouses in Germany, threatening to disrupt one of the year\u2019s busiest shopping days.\n\nLike the rest of Europe, Italians in recent years have embraced the U.S. tradition of Black Friday, a day of heavy discounting by retailers on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nUnions said in a statement more than 500 Amazon workers at the Piacenza site in northern Italy had agreed to strike following a failure to negotiate bonuses with the company.\n\nWorkers have also decided not to do any overtime until Dec. 31, covering the peak season for the online retailer which hires temporary workers during this period.\n\nAmazon employs around 1,600 people on a permanent basis at the Piacenza site, the first it built in the country after launching its Italian website in 2010.\n\nThe Verdi trade union in Germany said Amazon employees would also strike on Friday at six distribution centers in the country as part of a long-running dispute over pay and conditions.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest online retailer wants to achieve record sales on this day, but employees have to produce record performance not only on this day so that everything runs how Amazon wants it,\u201d said Verdi board member Stefanie Nutzenberger.\n\nAmazon in Italy said in a statement it remained focused on trying to guarantee scheduled deliveries for its customers on Black Friday and in the following days.\n\nThe company said salaries paid to its workers were among the highest in the logistic sector and that it also provided some benefits such as private medical insurance or money to pay for training programs.\n\nE-commerce is growing fast in Italy where online sales account only for 10 percent of overall retail sales, according to consultancy EY, half the European average."}, "http://www.mintpressnews.com/hacker-who-exposed-steubenville-rapists-may-get-more-prison-time-than-rapists/204683/": {"title": "Hacker Who Exposed Steubenville Rapists May Get More Prison Time Than Rapists", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/hacker-who-exposed-steubenville-rapists-may-get-more-prison-time-than-rapists/204683/", "text": "Deric Lostutter, the 26-year-old \u201chacktivist\u201d who leaked the evidence that led to the conviction of two of the Steubenville, Ohio rapists is now facing more time behind bars than the rapists he exposed.

They already put it in my browser and many others, so I\u2019ll summarize what it said (and I\u2019ll link to it once The Nation republishes it).\n\nTwo years ago, Haiti unanimously passed a law sharply raising its minimum wage to 61 cents an hour. That doesn\u2019t sound like much (and it isn\u2019t), but it was two and a half times the then-minimum of 24 cents an hour.\n\nThis infuriated contractors for (UPDATE: I originally wrote that the companies themselves did this here, but The Nation wrote that it was contractors for the companies, so I\u2019ve added \u201ccontractors for\u201d here) American corporations like Hanes and Levi Strauss that pay Haitians slave wages to sew their clothes. They said they would only fork over a seven-cent-an-hour increase, and they got the State Department involved. The U.S. ambassador put pressure on Haiti\u2019s president, who duly carved out a $3 a day minimum wage for textile companies (the U.S. minimum wage, which itself is very low, works out to $58 a day).\n\nWell, hey. Imagine Haitians doing things for their \u201cunemployed and underpaid masses\u201d rather than rich Yankee corporations. The outrage! No wonder we have 9.1 percent unemployment and 16 percent underemployment here while the folks who sent the economy in the tank are back making millions.\n\nLet\u2019s do a little math. Haiti has about 25,000 garment workers. If you paid each of them $2 a day more, it would cost their employers $50,000 per working day, or about $12.5 million a year.\n\nZooming in on specific companies helps clarify this even more. As of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year, and presumably it would pass on at least some of its higher labor costs to consumers.\n\nOr better yet, Hanesbrands CEO Richard Noll could forego some of his rich compensation package. He could $10 million package last year He could pay for the raises for those 3,200 t-shirt makers with just one-sixth of the $10 million in salary and bonus he raked in last year.\n\nAnd that five dollars a day? The Nation reports that a Haitian family of three (two kids) needed $12.50 a day in 2008 to make ends meet.\n\nBut, of course, the clothing companies are hardly America\u2019s only imperial beneficiaries in Haiti, as The Nation reports in a story on the oil companies that it hasn\u2019t pulled.\n\nA Triangle Shirtwaist-Like Disaster, Buried By the U.S. Press.

The company had overbooked the flight, which is standard practice in the airline industry, and then failed to entice enough people to give up their seats by offering as much as $800 to anyone who would volunteer. The final solution to the conundrum of too many passengers and not enough seats was to demand certain passengers give up their seats. When one man refused, he was forced out. The video of the event, which showed the man being beaten and bloodied by the police, went viral and attracted nearly universal condemnation. But the condemnation that I\u2019ve seen so far is very unclear about what the problem is. The video is violent and repulsive, but only insofar as all property and contract enforcement is. The forceful removal of the passenger is not an extraordinary aberration from our civilized capitalist order. Rather, it is an example of the everyday violence (and threatened violence) that keeps that capitalist order running. To see what I mean, let\u2019s consider two of the objections prominent commentators have made to the video to see how they stand up.\n\n1. Offer to pay the man more. This argument, especially prominent among economists on Twitter, says that the airline should have resolved the problem by continuing to increase the amount of money it was offering for volunteers to give up their seat until it had a taker. This, it is argued, would have avoided the disturbing violent outcome. When property rights are secure, prices clear markets \u2014 no violence required. https://t.co/IJopZp2tCl Although it\u2019s likely true that, at some price level, a passenger would have volunteered to get off the plane, it is not clear why the airline should have to offer any of the passengers any money. The property rights in this case are clear: the plane belongs to United Airlines, and the passenger\u2019s ticket does not entitle him to a seat on the airplane in a situation like this where he is commanded to give it up due to overbooking. Thus, he is, according to prevailing thought on this matter, engaged in trespassing. Do small-l liberal economists really think that, every time someone is trespassing, the owner should have to bribe them to leave? Imagine the incentives that would create. Anyone low on cash could just squat Bill Gates\u2019s house until he paid them enough to go away. Surely this is not what Coase\u2019s theorem imagines.\n\nOver at the libertarian Reason magazine, Brian Doherty somehow avoided an obvious contrarian libertarian take here and decided instead to write that the episode was bad because the police should not have gotten involved. While there may be something to be said for the ability for private businesses to summon the help of the police to remove people from their premises if they refuse to leave peacefully and their presence is unwanted, there is no excuse for the police to cooperate when the reason their presence is unwanted is not \u201ccausing a disturbance\u201d or being violent or threatening to other customers, or stealing goods or services, or doing anything wrong at all, but rather wanting to peacefully use the service they legitimately paid for. First, Doherty\u2019s ad hoc theory of when the police should not enforce an owner\u2019s property rights is not actually applicable in this case. Doherty concedes that normally it would be okay for a private business to call in the police muscle to enforce its property rights, but then says that this case is special because the passenger was merely \u201cwanting to peacefully use the service they legitimately paid for.\u201d But the terms of the ticket did not entitle the passenger to refuse to leave when he is asked to because of overbooking. According to the rules of the game, his sit-in protest was not legitimate and he was obligated to leave the airplane and catch the next flight. Second, whether it was the police who did the removal or private security guards does not really seem to matter here. If it was wrong to violently expel this man, then surely it would have been wrong even if United staff did it. On the flip side, if it is the case (and it is) that the man had no contractual or property right to remain on that plane after being told to leave, then surely the police are authorized to enforce the property rights of the airlines. That is, after all, how the system works.\n\nNo matter how you cut it, there does not seem to have been anything wrong with what happened here, under the logic of capitalist institutions. It may not have been a good PR move for the airline. They probably could have avoided it all by gratuitously offering more money to get the trespasser to leave. But none of these points turns the thing into a violation of capitalist ethics. It wasn\u2019t. Instead of soothing ourselves with the idea that this particular application of violence was illegitimate or extraordinary, we should instead confront it head on as a necessary feature of capitalist society. This kind of violence (or threats of it) is operating all the time. Why does the homeless man sleep in the doorway of an empty office building instead of inside the building itself? Because the police have threatened to attack him just like they attacked this airline passenger. Why does a poor family go to bed hungry when they could just grab food from the supermarket a few blocks away? Because the police have threatened to attack them just like this passenger. Of course, these threats of capitalist violence are so credible that few dare to act in ways that will trigger them. But the violence is always there, lurking in the background. It is the engine that makes our whole system run. It is what maintains severe inequalities, poverty, and the power of the boss over the worker. We build elaborate theories to pretend that it is not the case in order to naturalize the human-made economic injustices of our society. But it is the case. Violent state coercion like what you saw in that video is what runs this show."}, "http://www.katc.com/story/37220702/teacher-removed-from-vermilion-parish-school-board-meeting": {"title": "Watch and read KATC's full coverage of the Vermilion teacher incident", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.katc.com/story/37220702/teacher-removed-from-vermilion-parish-school-board-meeting", "text": "No charges will be filed against a Vermilion Parish teacher who was arrested at a school board meeting last night.\n\nIke Funderburk, Abbeville's city attorney and prosecutor, said he has reviewed the video and won't be prosecuting her.\n\n\"I have reviewed the video and I am not going to approve any charges against the teacher,\" Funderburk said. \"I talked with the attorney for the school board, and they do not wish to pursue any charges against the teacher.\"\n\nBoard President Anthony Fontana says he thinks the whole thing was a \"set up.\"\n\n\"The other four board members, now three, have been committed to getting rid of the superintendent. No matter how good the policy might be, they would be against it to cast disfavor on the superintendent to prevent him from getting a contract,\" said Fontana, who also is an attorney. \"The whole issue, from day one, was that they were not going to give him a contract.\"\n\nTwo board members, who have been at odds with Fontana over Puyau's contract and other issues before the board, and even boycotted meetings last fall, told the AP that they think Hargrave's treatment is related to the fact she's female.\n\nWomen have several times been told to leave meetings, while men who speak out have not been removed, board member Laura LeBeouf, who voted against the superintendent's contract at Monday's meeting, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview on Tuesday.\n\n\"When she realized she had to get out, she picked up her purse and walked out,\" LeBeouf said. \"Women in this parish are not getting the same treatment.\"\n\nBoard member Sara Duplechain, who also voted against the superintendent's contract at the meeting, expressed similar sentiments.\n\n \n\n\"No reason for anyone to be treated this way. So far in 3 years, only women have been removed from boardroom meetings,\" Sara Duplechain wrote in an emailed response to AP's questions.\n\nDuplechain called the police on Fontana last fall after the first meeting following the boycott, accusing him of yelling at her in the parking lot. No charges were filed by police.\n\nFontana said the teacher arrested after Monday's meeting was not following the rules of board meeting procedure.\n\n\"If a teacher has the authority to send a student, who is acting up and she can't control, out of the classroom to the principal's office, under our policy we have the same rules,\" Fontana said. \"We have certain rules: three-minute speech, it has to be civilized, it can't get off target, it has to be related to the issue before the board. That's not what was happening last night.\n\n\"The marshal did his job. He went over there to settle it down. He couldn't settle it down. She's the one who made the choice to continue speaking,\" Fontana said. \"He was taking her out. He wasn't arresting her. He was escorting her out, telling her don't come back tonight. It escalated out in the hall and she ended up getting arrested. \"He did exactly what he was hired to do. He followed the procedures completely. She's the one who made the choices that got her arrested \"\n\nFontana said he had to lock down the school board office Tuesday because of death threats. He said he had called police, the sheriff's office and the FBI about the threats.\n\n\"I told my staff not to answer the phone unless they knew who it was. My staff was scared to death, because they got a call that a man said he was on his way to the school board office, making threats,\" Fontana said.\n\nThe teacher's attorney said he was meeting with her this evening, and she would have no statement on the situation until tomorrow.\n\nFunderburk also said the marshal who arrested her is a school resource officer who is employed by the school board and he \"was not acting in any official capacity on behalf of the city of Abbeville.\"\n\nWe've reached out to the Marshals' Office for comment, but none of our calls or requests have been returned. We asked if there was any change in the officer's employment status and were told there was not.\n\nThe officer has been at board meetings for the past several months, since board members requested security for each meeting.\n\nMore stories from KATC covering this incident are listed below:\n\nA look at the vote on Superintendent Puyau's new contract\n\nUPDATE: Hargrave speaks for first time since arrest\n\nThe teacher was booked into jail last night, even though the superintendent told KATC shortly after the meeting that he had called to inform police that the system didn't want any charges pressed.\n\nRecords indicate Deyshia Hargrave was booked into the city jail with remaining after being forbidden and resisting an officer. The cooperation of the school system would not be required to arrest her on either of those charges; the officer could arrest her on his complaint.\n\nSuperintendent Jerome Puyau told KATC Monday night that he called to ensure that police knew the system was not pressing charges against Hargrave, but she was booked anyway, records show. She has since bonded out. City Prosecutor Ike Funderburk told KATC that the School System officials had called him this morning to reiterate that the system wasn't interested in pursuing charges.\n\nAt Monday's meeting, the board approved a renewal of Puyau's contract, which included the first raise he has received since he was hired for the job in 2013. His salary increased from $110,190 to $140,188. During Puyau's tenure as superintendent, the district's state ranking has improved from a B to an A. The A was awarded in 2015 and the district continues to be graded an A. In 2017, 12 of the district's schools were ranked as A, up from 3 when he took over in 2013.\n\nHargrave, an English language arts teacher at Rene Rost Middle School in Kaplan, addressed the board during the public comments portion of the meeting to discuss teacher salaries and pay raises. After Hargrave posed several questions, board president Anthony Fontana ruled Hargrave out of order, warning her that the public comment section was not for a question-and-answer session.\n\nHargrave was called upon a second time for comment. After posing another question, and while Puyau was talking to her, an Abbeville city marshal on duty at the meeting escorted Hargrave out of the meeting. Handcuffs were later placed on Hargrave in the hallway, as she was removed from the building.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, Vermilion Parish School Board President Anthony Fontana stated that he supports the deputy marshal's decision to remove the teacher from last night's school board meeting.\n\nThe deputy marshal is a school resource officer who works in Vermilion Parish schools. The Abbeville Police Department has received so many calls about the case they issued a statement pointing out that it has nothing to do with them:\n\nThe Louisiana Association of Educators who is representing Hargrave released the following statement on the incident denouncing the treatment Hargrave experienced.\n\nBelow is the twitter message issued today expressing the same sentiments from LAE. Beyond these statements, LAE says they are refraining from making any further statements as the investigation continues.\n\nThe ACLU of Louisiana has also released a statement on the Vermilion Parish teachers arrest. The organization says the actions of the officer as \"unacceptable and raise serious constitutional concerns\". A press release states that they are also investigating the incident.\n\nIt is unclear if the marshal was acting on his own accord or on the orders of board members.

They define themselves as American fascists or American nationalists, focused on preserving America's identity.\n\nIn recent weeks, Patriot Front posters appeared on downtown Burlington bulletin boards, and racist anti-immigrant posters were put up on the University of Vermont green as students were returning to classes after Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nWhen reports from anti-fascist groups emerged on Twitter saying that Patriot Front was coming to town to rally and spread their hate, students at the University of Vermont (UVM) and Burlington residents decided enough was enough.\n\nThey responded in a united fashion, confronting the racist actions and hate speech of these cowards with our own speech and protest.\n\nJabari Jones of the People of Color Caucus in Burlington put out a call to action over social media on February 9, after receiving word that the fascists were planning a demonstration in the high-visibility Staples parking lot next to the highway.\n\nThe International Socialist Organization at UVM organized a student march from the university down to the shopping center. Black Rose/Rosa Negra Burlington and the Peace and Justice Center also put out a call to action, and many other groups mobilized to join the action.\n\nCommunity members already at the shopping center cheered loudly as they were joined by students marching down Williston Road, chanting \"No hate, no fear immigrants are welcome here!\" and \"No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA!\" There were no obvious signs of any members of Patriot Front.\n\nAMONG THE counterprotesters who occupied the sidewalk, shouting chants into the streets, was 21 year-old Drew Baker, a student at the University of Vermont. \"I'm here today because a certain group of folks decided to wake up this morning and spread hate,\" he said. \"In response to that, an even larger group of people decided to wake up and stand in solidarity.\"\n\nMary Robideau, also a UVM student, spoke of the scarring experience she had last fall while protesting fascists in Charlottesville, Virginia, where social justice activist Heather Heyer was killed. \"That kind of put me off of activism for a little bit, honestly,\" she said, explaining her need to take time to recover. \"But I decided that these white supremacist movements have to be squashed.\"\n\nThe next day, the Burlington Free Press reported that a handful of Patriot Front cowards avoided the confrontation at their planned rally site and crossed town to City Hall park to wave their banners on the corner, where they were shouted down by a \"couple of kids\" and were gone in about 10 minutes.\n\nA video posted on Patriot Front's Twitter page was apparently taken down after someone pointed out that their license plate was visible.\n\nThe news that neo-Nazis did rally in our city was met with anger and sadness over social media by many of the people who came out to confront them on Saturday. This is understandable, but we shouldn't miss the point that the counterdemonstration of hundreds forced them away from their intended location.\n\nBecause Staples Plaza is close to a highway overpass, many counterdemonstrators believed Patriot Front was planning to hang racist banners from the overpass\u2014one of its favorite tactics. Instead, the racists were forced to turn tail and hold a pathetic rally, where they were shouted down by youth.\n\nThe lesson for anti-racists in Burlington is clear: Don't wait! Organize against hate immediately. When racist posters go up, we must unite and take action to show people in targeted communities that people have their back\u2014and show the fascists that they are the ones who are isolated."}, "http://thebreadbook.org/": {"title": "Welcome to the Bread Book", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://thebreadbook.org/", "text": "For most people, the idea of working 40 hours a week their entire life, in a job they don\u2019t particularly enjoy, is a hellish prospect.

But an honest history leads to different conclusions, writes Lider Restrepo.\n\nTO HEAR Donald Trump tell it, America is being invaded by a foreign enemy: \"MS-13 and other criminal gangs [breaking] into our country,\" as he said in his State of the Union speech last month.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump sounded the racist alarm about MS-13. In a speech to police officers in New York last May, Trump described the gang's alleged activities in the U.S. in graphic and sensationalistic detail:\n\nTrump's imagery of \"peaceful parks\" and \"beautiful, quiet neighborhoods\" turned into \"blood-stained killing fields\" follows the rhetoric of past reactionaries trying to drum up support for an agenda of repression and violence by portraying a quaint (and white) America imperiled by a sub-human threat.\n\nIn this case, the racist scapegoating is directed at immigrants.\n\nTrump is trying to rally support for the attack on immigrants--from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to increasing raids, detentions and deportations--by peddling the idea that MS-13 is a out-of-control foreign danger caused by Barack Obama's supposedly lax immigration policy and border security.\n\nUnlike Trump's conjured \"threat\" facing Americans, his inaccuracies and outright falsehoods about MS-13 pose an actual danger--for Latinx immigrants in particular.\n\nThe reality is that MS-13 is U.S.-made--the gang first formed in this country. Its presence is now overwhelmingly in Central American countries because of mass deportation.\n\nBoth MS-13's formation and the threat that gang violence poses today--most of all in Central America, not the U.S.--is the legacy of American imperialism and the result of \"tough on crime\" and anti-immigrant policies enacted by past administrations.\n\nTHROUGH THE 1980s, the U.S. experienced an influx of refugees looking to escape the violence of the civil war in El Salvador, a conflict that began in 1979, pitting the U.S.-backed government against a coalition of left-wing groups, with armed guerilla wings, called the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front.\n\nEl Salvador's civil war existed alongside the Guatemalan civil war and the U.S.-backed assault on the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.\n\nHanging over all of the conflicts in the region at this time was the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the former USSR. The U.S. spent billions in military and economic aid in order to stem what it saw as the growth of communism in Central America. In the name of stopping the USSR's influence, the U.S. supported governments and armed groups that were ruthlessly violent and despotic.\n\nRonald Reagan's administration in the 1980s continually refused to grant refugees Extended Voluntary Departure (EVD)--a precursor to the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) now under fire from the Trump administration--on the grounds that the dangerous conditions in El Salvador were not sufficiently intense or widespread.\n\nCritics called out the administration's political motivations for this decision. \"If we gave the refugees asylum, it would be an admission that the government in El Salvador, which we support, violates human rights,\" Peter Schey of the National Center for Immigrants' Rights said in 1983.\n\nStill, the Reagan administration couldn't stem the arrival of Salvadorans throughout the decade. And pressure from immigrant rights groups forced the federal government to acknowledge the conditions that refugees were escaping from, though no protective status was ever officially implemented.\n\nWith conflict disrupting El Salvador's economy, Salvadorans who fled the country did so as much to find work as to escape violence. Some left with their families to build new lives, but many made the difficult decision of leaving their families behind and sending money back.\n\nThose who arrived in cities across the U.S.--particularly Los Angeles--experienced hostility and alienation. Parents struggled to find work, and many worked multiple jobs. Refugee youth felt compelled to join or create gangs to protect themselves and their communities.\n\nOne of these gangs eventually became Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13. It originated in Los Angeles in the early 1980s and eventually spread to other metropolitan areas, including San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City and others.\n\nTHE RUTHLESS brutality that young Salvadorans witnessed and experienced during the civil war shaped their approach to what they saw as self-preservation by forming gangs. There was a distinct form of hyper-masculinity for young men in the face of their vulnerable status.\n\nBelonging and security is what people seek when they join gangs. But for refugees without legal status or protections in their new home in the U.S., crime also provided economic opportunities otherwise denied to them.\n\nSimilarly dire conditions in El Salvador allowed the gangs to thrive when members were deported in the early 1990s.\n\nDuring the civil war, the government that the U.S. armed and supported was responsible for thousands of murders and disappearances. The victims included unionists, community organizers and religious leaders--anyone suspected of being a sympathizer with the guerillas.\n\nThe conflict subsided with the signing of peace accords in 1992, which represented a victory for the government. Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA), a right-wing party formed in 1981, cemented its power in El Salvador at the end of the 1980s.\n\nThe stage was set for the growing international influence of neoliberalism to be felt in the Central American country, with poor and working class communities bearing the brunt in El Salvador, as in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. began stepping up its deportation of non-citizens with criminal records. Gang members arriving in El Salvador took advantage of the conservative government's indifference toward the most neglected communities. Their experiences included both the brutality of the civil war era and the gang culture of Los Angeles, incubated in U.S. prisons.\n\nThe government was unprepared to respond. When it did in 2003, its program, named La Mano Dura (\"The Firm Hand\" or \"Iron Fist\"), combined repressive policing and incarceration, both familiar to MS-13 members who joined the gang in the U.S.\n\nLa Mano Dura and subsequent operations not only failed in its objectives, but actually led to an escalation of violence, mass incarceration and the erosion of civil liberties for Salvadorans.\n\nThe solutions that the U.S. pushes on Central American governments, from anti-gang task forces to stepped-up prosecution to the \"war on drugs,\" have ensured that the conditions that reproduce gang violence continue to exist.\n\nTYING THE issue of immigration to the threat of gang violence relies on instigating racially motivated anxiety. Trump is using racist lies and distortions in an attempt to legitimize further criminalization, detention and deportation of Latinx immigrants in particular.\n\nThis has already translated into tougher visa screenings for Salvadorans and the end of the Central American Minors (CAM) Program, which allowed children fleeing violence to apply for refugee status.\n\nTrump's MS-13 rhetoric helps to justify incredibly destructive policies that have already given a license for law enforcement and the criminal justice system to increase violence and the use of prisons.\n\nThis all exists alongside the dismantling of social welfare programs, which has been catastrophic for poor and working class people, and people of color. Dire circumstances lead people--whether in the U.S. or Central America--who are desperate to find material security and a sense of dignity to seek out gangs like MS-13, which recruit by promising protection and stability.\n\nWhipping up fear of crime and violence to justify repression and state violence is an old tool that Trump is putting to use on a number of issues, including immigration.\n\nBut the policies that flow from this narrative ignore the root causes and ongoing conditions that lead to gangs like MS-13 forming and flourishing. And while Trump claims that his administration is protecting America from \"criminals,\" his right-wing agenda is causing greater misery and suffering for the large majority of people living in the U.S."}, "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36190557": {"title": "Italian food theft ruled 'not a crime'", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36190557", "text": "Stealing small amounts of food to stave off hunger is not a crime, Italy's highest court of appeal has ruled.\n\nJudges overturned a theft conviction against Roman Ostriakov after he stole cheese and sausages worth \u20ac4.07 (\u00a33;

Just one month after moving in, Hurricane Harvey swept through and the Fuenteses were left not only with the ruined furniture but also an ongoing rental demand for a dwelling they had to flee.\n\n\u201cAt first we didn\u2019t think it would be that bad, but then the water came through the wall and up through the carpet,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cOnce we saw the water wasn\u2019t going to stop, we left.\u201d\n\nFuentes, her husband Jaime and their five children, ages ranging from seven months to 14 years, were plucked from the floodwaters by her mother, who arrived in a truck. They are now crammed into her sister\u2019s apartment and with no insurance have little idea where they will live next. Jaime is unable to earn money because his construction job has been paused due to the flooding.\n\nBut while everything has changed for this family, they are still expected to pay for their abandoned home.\n\n\u201cOur landlords say we have to pay rent and late fees and every day it is going up,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cWe are paying rent for somewhere we can\u2019t live in. They said \u2018you aren\u2019t the only ones in this situation\u2019, but what are we supposed to do? We don\u2019t have any money. We don\u2019t have anything.\u201d\n\nAn acute housing crisis is starting to grip thousands of other families in south-east Texas as the floodwaters ebb away, with a death toll put at 60 on Monday. More than 180,000 houses in the Houston area have been badly damaged, with only a fraction of occupants owning any flood insurance. And under Texas law, rent must still be paid on damaged dwellings, unless they are deemed completely uninhabitable.\n\nA spokeswoman for the city of Houston\u2019s housing department said city officials \u201care aware these problems exist\u201d but said that state law deals with the situation. She said the city was still assessing the total number of people in need of housing assistance.\n\nUnder the Texas property code, if a rental premises is \u201ctotally unusable\u201d due to an external disaster then either the landlord or tenant can terminate the lease through written notice. But if the property is \u201cpartially unusable\u201d because of a disaster, a tenant may only get a reduction in rent determined by a county or district court.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of property owners who aren\u2019t conscious of what has gone on; they are being rude and kicking people out,\u201d said Isela Bezada, an unemployed woman who lived with 10 family members in a Houston house until her landlord took her to court to evict her after the hurricane hit.\n\nBezada, like Fuentes, has had almost every area of her life touched by the flood. Her relatives, who work in home renovations, have little opportunity to bring in money until the full gutting of sodden houses \u2013 piles of torn up carpet, broken chairs and children\u2019s toys have become a common adornment to the front of Houston homes \u2013 and she worries about other family members stranded in Port Arthur by a flooded highway.\n\n\u201cThere are people who have been hit really badly by these floods,\u201d Bezada said. \u201cWe are all human beings. We all deserve help.\u201d\n\nA sense of maudlin uncertainty hangs over many people who now depend on shelters and food distribution centers where once they had a stable home life. At the St Juan Diego Catholic Church in Pasadena, hundreds of people rifle through huge piles of donated clothing while tamales and pupusas are cooked outside for the hungry crowd. A sign inside the donation center, in Spanish, informs families they can only take one package of bottled water each.\n\nTrucks, bringing donations of baby food, salads, blankets and other assortments, pull up at the center several times a day, stocked by well wishers as far away as Ohio. Volunteers report that more and more displaced people are showing up, more than a week after Hurricane Harvey hit, as they struggle to deal with their new circumstances.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people here have lost everything,\u201d said Ernest Paredes, an organizer of the center. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the city is doing but there is a concern that people living in apartments are still being charged and that needs to be looked into. If they are getting help, they shouldn\u2019t be charged.\u201d\n\nMore than half a million people have applied for Fema help, with $33.6m already approved for housing assistance, which includes rent subsidies. Nearly 15,000 survivors have been put up by Fema in hotels and motels. A contractor has been asked by Fema to produce at least 4,500 pre-fabricated houses for displaced families.\n\nBut further help is needed, as Houston mayor Sylvester Turner stressed on Sunday, when he was asked on NBC what his priority areas were. \u201cHousing, housing, housing,\u201d Turner replied. The mayor has asked Donald Trump for more federal help to help repair homes but even that expanded initiative would only cover 35,000 dwellings.\n\nWith such demands on Fema help, there are inevitable frustrations over delays over assistance that may stretch for weeks or even longer. Erica Hall, who lived next to the Brays bayou in west Houston until the waterway swelled into her first floor apartment, has been ensconced on camp beds in a Red Cross-run shelter for the past week with her three children, all aged under four.\n\nConfronted by knee-high sewage, Hall took her children onto the roof of a nearby car port, where they were plucked by the US coast guard, which dangled a basket on a rope for the family to climb into. Hall had never been in any sort of aircraft before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced being in an airplane or helicopter so I was terrified, I just closed my eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids weren\u2019t scared, they just said \u2018ooh look at the water!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith no flood insurance, Hall is now depending on Fema. She may be in the shelter another week while she waits, maybe longer.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of other people affected besides me and my family but I just wish the process could move a little faster so we can get on with our lives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter where I go, as long as it\u2019s stable.

A week later, on Jan. 14, the Islamic Center of Eastside in Bellevue, Washington, burned.\n\nTwo weeks after that, on Jan. 28, several hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, a fire destroyed the Islamic Center of Victoria in Texas.\n\nThen, this past Friday, Feb. 24, a small blaze broke out at the front entrance of the Daarus Salaam Mosque near Tampa.\n\nAuthorities have ruled that three of the four fires were caused by arson. An official at the Travis County Fire Marshal told BuzzFeed News that the investigation into the cause of the fire at the Islamic Center of Lake Travis remains open.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen four mosques burned within seven weeks of each other,\u201d said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups around the country. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a whole series of dramatic attacks on Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe mosque fires come amid increased fear about hate crimes against minority religious groups. In recent weeks, scores of bomb threats were called into Jewish community centers and schools around the country and graveyards in Jewish cemeteries in three states were vandalized. On Sunday, somebody threw a rock through a window of the Masjid Abu Bakr mosque in Denver. In Redmond, Washington, vandals destroyed the Muslim Association of Puget Sound mosque\u2019s entrance sign on two occasions within two months of the election. Two days after the inauguration, a woman shattered the windows of the Davis Islamic Center in California, and left strips of raw bacon on a door handle. In January, a white nationalist fatally shot six people at a mosque in Qu\u00e9bec City. Last week, a white man shot two Indian men, one fatally, at a Kansas bar after making racial slurs, questioning their immigration status, and shouting, \"Get out of my country.\"\n\n\"The short answer is we haven\u2019t seen anything like this in the past,\u201d Potok said, referring to the overall surge in reported hate crimes across the country. \"This is my 18th year here and I haven\u2019t seen anything remotely like this.\"\n\nTo have three mosque fires ruled arson within six weeks is highly unusual, said Corey Saylor, director of the Department to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cIn normal times, I will see one to two mosque incidents of any type per month, and rarely is it arson,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you for sure I have not seen levels of violence like this since I started tracking this stuff\u201d in 2009.\n\nThe fire at the Islamic Center of Lake Travis \u2014 which nearly two months later is still under investigation \u2014 destroyed the partially constructed frame. Community members began raising funds for the building four years earlier.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot more people who are in support of us building this back again than people who oppose us but it takes one crazy guy to do something,\u201d Shakeel Rashed, an executive board member of the Islamic Center of Lake Travis, told the Texas Tribune in January.\n\n\u201cEverybody believes we need to be more vigilant. When we start reconstruction we definitely want to plan the security of the place better, have more cameras,\u201d Rashed said.\n\nIn Bellevue, Washington, six days before the inauguration, surveillance cameras caught a man walking toward the Islamic Center of Eastside while carrying a backpack and a gallon jug shortly before 2:45 a.m., the Seattle Times reported. Less than a minute later, the mosque was on fire. Investigators at the scene found a melted gallon jug and a gas can. Officers arrested Isaac Wayne Wilson, who remained at the scene, smelled of gasoline, and confessed to setting the blaze, according to police. Authorities said there was no evidence it was a hate crime. Six months earlier, Wilson, who has a history of mental illness, had been convicted of misdemeanor assault after an incident at the mosque.\n\nHours after President Donald Trump signed the controversial executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, someone intentionally set fire to the Islamic Center of Victoria in Texas in the middle of the night, according to investigators, who have yet to identify a suspect. The blaze caused more than $500,000 in damage, and completely destroyed the 16-year-old mosque, shaking the Muslim American community in south Texas. The mosque's president, Dr. Shahid Hashmi, told the Texas Tribune his community would forgive whoever set the fire, but added, \"there\u2019s no way we can forget. There\u2019s no way our children can forget.\u201d\n\nThe fire at the Daarus Salaam Mosque in Thonotosassa, Florida, on Friday was at least the third time in seven months that a mosque in the Tampa area had been set on fire, following incidents at the Islamic Education Center in July and the Masjid Omar mosque in August."}, "https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/17/15973478/bosses-dictators-workplace-rights-free-markets-unions": {"title": "How bosses are (literally) like dictators", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/17/15973478/bosses-dictators-workplace-rights-free-markets-unions", "text": "Consider some facts about how American employers control their workers. Amazon prohibits employees from exchanging casual remarks while on duty, calling this \u201ctime theft.\u201d Apple inspects the personal belongings of its retail workers, some of whom lose up to a half-hour of unpaid time every day as they wait in line to be searched. Tyson prevents its poultry workers from using the bathroom. Some have been forced to urinate on themselves while their supervisors mock them.\n\nAbout half of US employees have been subject to suspicionless drug screening by their employers. Millions are pressured by their employers to support particular political causes or candidates. Soon employers will be empowered to withhold contraception coverage from their employees\u2019 health insurance. They already have the right to penalize workers for failure to exercise and diet, by charging them higher health insurance premiums.\n\nHow should we understand these sweeping powers that employers have to regulate their employees\u2019 lives, both on and off duty? Most people don\u2019t use the term in this context, but wherever some have the authority to issue orders to others, backed by sanctions, in some domain of life, that authority is a government.\n\nWe usually assume that \u201cgovernment\u201d refers to state authorities. Yet the state is only one kind of government. Every organization needs some way to govern itself \u2014 to designate who has authority to make decisions concerning its affairs, what their powers are, and what consequences they may mete out to those beneath them in the organizational chart who fail to do their part in carrying out the organization\u2019s decisions.\n\nManagers in private firms can impose, for almost any reason, sanctions including job loss, demotion, pay cuts, worse hours, worse conditions, and harassment. The top managers of firms are therefore the heads of little governments, who rule their workers while they are at work \u2014 and often even when they are off duty.\n\nEvery government has a constitution, which determines whether it is a democracy, a dictatorship, or something else. In a democracy like the United States, the government is \u201cpublic.\u201d This means it is properly the business of the governed: transparent to them and servant to their interests. They have a voice and the power to hold rulers accountable.\n\nNot every government is public in this way. When King Louis XIV of France said, \u201cL'etat, c'est moi,\u201d he meant that his government was his business alone, something he kept private from those he governed. They weren\u2019t entitled to know how he operated it, had no standing to insist he take their interests into account in his decisions, and no right to hold him accountable for his actions.\n\nLike Louis XIV\u2019s government, the typical American workplace is kept private from those it governs. Managers often conceal decisions of vital interest to their workers. Often, they don\u2019t even give advance notice of firm closures and layoffs. They are free to sacrifice workers\u2019 dignity in dominating and humiliating their subordinates. Most employer harassment of workers is perfectly legal, as long as bosses mete it out on an equal-opportunity basis. (Walmart and Amazon managers are notorious for berating and belittling their workers.) And workers have virtually no power to hold their bosses accountable for such abuses: They can\u2019t fire their bosses, and can\u2019t sue them for mistreatment except in a very narrow range of cases, mostly having to do with discrimination.\n\nWhy are workers subject to private government? The state has set the default terms of the constitution of workplace government through its employment laws. The most important source of employers\u2019 power is the default rule of employment at will. Unless the parties have otherwise agreed, employers are free to fire workers for almost any or no reason. This amounts to an effective grant of power to employers to rule the lives of their employees in almost any respect \u2014 not just on the job but off duty as well. And they have exercised that power.\n\nScotts, the lawn care company, fired an employee for smoking off duty. After Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) notified Lakeland Bank that an employee had complained he wasn\u2019t holding town hall meetings, the bank intimidated her into resigning. San Diego Christian College fired a teacher for having premarital sex \u2014 and hired her fianc\u00e9 to fill her post. Bosses are dictators, and workers are their subjects.\n\nIf efficiency means that workers are forced to pee in their pants, why shouldn\u2019t they have a say in whether such \u201cefficiency\u201d is worthwhile?\n\nAmerican public discourse doesn\u2019t give us helpful ways to talk about the dictatorial rule of employers. Instead, we talk as if workers aren\u2019t ruled by their bosses. We are told that unregulated markets make us free, and that the only threat to our liberties is the state. We are told that in the market, all transactions are voluntary. We are told that since workers freely enter and exit the labor contract, they are perfectly free under it. We prize our skepticism about \u201cgovernment,\u201d without extending our critique to workplace dictatorship.\n\nWhy do we talk like this? The answer takes us back to free market ideas developed before the Industrial Revolution. In 17th- and 18th-century Britain, big merchants got the state to grant them monopolies over trade in particular goods, forcing small craftsmen to submit to their regulations. A handful of aristocratic families enjoyed a monopoly on land, due to primogeniture and entail, which barred the breakup and sale of any part of large estates. Farmers could rent their land only on short-term leases, which forced them to bow and scrape before their landlords, in a condition of subordination not much different from servants, who lived in their masters\u2019 households and had to obey their rules.\n\nThe problem was that the state had rigged the rules of the market in favor of the rich. Confronted with this economic situation, many people argued that free markets would promote equality and workers\u2019 interests by enabling them to go into business for themselves and thereby escape subordination to the owners of capital.\n\nNo wonder some of the early advocates of free markets in 17th-century England were called \u201cLevellers.\u201d These radicals, who emerged during the English civil war, wanted to abolish the monopolies held by the big merchants and aristocrats. They saw the prospects of greater equality that might come from opening up to ordinary workers opportunities for manufacture, trade, and farming one\u2019s own land.\n\nIn the 18th century, Adam Smith was the greatest advocate for the view that replacing monopolies, primogeniture, entail, and involuntary servitude with free markets would enable laborers to work on their own behalf. His key assumption was that incentives were more powerful than economies of scale. When workers get to keep all of the fruits of their labor, as they do when self-employed, they will work much harder and more efficiently than if they are employed by a master, who takes a cut of what they produce. Indolent aristocratic landowners can\u2019t compete with yeoman farmers without laws preventing land sales. Free markets in land, labor, and commerce will therefore lead to the triumph of the most efficient producer, the self-employed worker, and the demise of the idle, stupid, rent-seeking rentier.\n\nSmith and his contemporaries looked across the Atlantic and saw that America appeared to be realizing these hopes \u2014 although only for white men. The great majority of the free population in the Revolutionary period was self-employed, as either a yeoman farmer or an independent artisan or merchant.\n\nIn the United States, Thomas Paine was the great promoter of this vision. Indeed, his views on political economy sound as if they could have been ripped out of the GOP Freedom Caucus playbook. Paine argued that individuals can solve nearly all of their problems on their own, without state meddling. A good government does nothing more than secure individuals in \u201cpeace and safety\u201d in the free pursuit of their occupations, with the lowest possible tax burden. Taxation is theft. People living off government pay are social parasites. Government is the chief cause of poverty. Paine was a lifelong advocate of commerce, free trade, and free markets. He called for hard money and fiscal responsibility.\n\nPaine was the hero of labor radicals for decades after his death in 1809, because they shared his hope that free markets would yield an economy almost entirely composed of small proprietors. An economy of small proprietors offers a plausible model of a free society of equals: each individual personally independent, none taking orders from anyone else, everyone middle class.\n\nAbraham Lincoln built on the vision of Smith and Paine, which helped to shape the two key planks of the Republican Party platform: opposition to the extension of slavery in the territories, and the Homestead Act. Slavery, after all, enabled masters to accumulate vast tracts of land, squeezing out small farmers and forcing them into wage labor. Prohibiting the extension of slavery into the territories and giving away small plots of land to anyone who would work it would realize a society of equals in which no one is ever consigned to wage labor for life. Lincoln, who helped create the political party that now defends the interests of business, never wavered from the proposition that true free labor meant freedom from wage labor.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, however \u2014 well underway by Lincoln\u2019s time \u2014 ultimately dashed the hopes of joining free markets with independent labor in a society of equals. Smith\u2019s prediction \u2014 that economies of scale would be less important than the incentive effects of enabling workers to reap all the fruits of their labor \u2014 was defeated by industrial technologies that required massive accumulations of capital. The US, with its access to territories seized from Native Americans, was able to stave off the bankruptcy of self-employed farmers and other small proprietors for far longer than Europe. But industrialization, population growth, the closure of the frontier, and railroad monopolies doomed the sole proprietorship to the margins of the economy, even in North America.\n\nThe Smith-Paine-Lincoln libertarian vision was rendered largely irrelevant by industrialization, which created a new model of wage labor, with large companies taking the place of large landowners. Yet strangely, many people persist in using Smith\u2019s and Paine\u2019s rhetoric to describe the world we live in today. We are told that our choice is between free markets and state control \u2014 but most adults live their working lives under a third thing entirely: private government. A vision of what egalitarians hoped market society would deliver before the Industrial Revolution \u2014 a world without private workplace government, with producers interacting only through markets and the state \u2014 has been blindly carried over to the modern economy by libertarians and their pro-business fellow travelers.\n\nThere is a condition called hemiagnosia, whose sufferers cannot perceive one half of their bodies. A large class of libertarian-leaning thinkers and politicians, with considerable public following, resemble patients with this condition: They cannot perceive half of the economy \u2014 the half that takes place beyond the market, after the employment contract is accepted, where workers are subject to private, arbitrary, unaccountable government.\n\nWhat can we do about this? Americans are used to complaining about how government regulation restricts our freedom. So we should recognize that such complaints apply, with at least as much force, to private governments of the workplace. For while the punishments employers can impose for disobedience aren\u2019t as severe as those available to the state, the scope of employers\u2019 authority over workers is more sweeping and exacting, its power more arbitrary and unaccountable. Therefore, it is high time we considered remedies for reining in the private government of the workplace similar to those we have long insisted should apply to the state.\n\nThree types of remedy are of special importance. First, recall a key demand the United States made of communist dictatorships during the Cold War: Let dissenters leave. Although workers are formally free to leave their workplace dictatorships, they often pay a steep price. Nearly one-fifth of American workers labor under noncompete clauses. This means they can\u2019t work in the same industry if they quit or are fired.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just engineers and other \u201cknowledge economy\u201d workers who are restricted in this way: Even some minimum wage workers are forced to sign noncompetes. Workers who must leave their human capital behind are not truly free to quit. Every state should follow California\u2019s example and ban noncompete clauses from work contracts.\n\nSecond, consider that if the state imposed surveillance and regulations on us in anything like the way that private employers do, we would rightly protest that our constitutional rights were being violated. American workers have few such rights against their bosses, and the rights they have are very weakly enforced. We should strengthen the constitutional rights that workers have against their employers, and rigorously enforce the ones the law already purports to recognize.\n\nAmong the most important of these rights are to freedom of speech and association. This means employers shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate workers\u2019 off-duty speech and association, or informal non-harassing talk during breaks or on duty, if it does not unduly interfere with job performance. Nor should they be able to prevent workers from supporting the candidate of their choice.\n\nThird, we should make the government of the workplace more public (in the sense that political scientists use the term). Workers need a real voice in how they are governed \u2014 not just the right to complain without getting fired, but an organized way to insist that their interests have weight in decisions about how work is organized.\n\nOne way to do this would be to strengthen the rights of labor unions to organize. Labor unions are a vital tool for checking abusive and exploitative employers. However, due to lax enforcement of laws protecting the right to organize and discuss workplace complaints, many workers are fired for these activities. And many workers shy away from unionization, because they prefer a collaborative to an adversarial relationship to their employer.\n\nYet even when employers are decent, workers could still use a voice. In many of the rich states of Europe, they already have one, even if they don\u2019t belong to a union. It\u2019s called \u201cco-determination\u201d \u2014 a system of joint workplace governance by workers and managers, which automatically applies to firms with more than a few dozen employees. Under co-determination, workers elect representatives to a works council, which participates in decision-making concerning hours, layoffs, plant closures, workplace conditions, and processes. Workers in publicly traded firms also elect some members of the board of directors of the firm.\n\nAgainst these proposals, libertarian and neoliberal economists theorize that workers somehow suffer from provisions that would secure their dignity, autonomy, and voice at work. That\u2019s because the efficiency of firms would, in theory, drop \u2014 along with profits, and therefore wages \u2014 if managers did not have maximum control of their workforce. These thinkers insist that employers already compensate workers for any \u201coppressive\u201d conditions that may exist by offering higher wages. Workers are therefore free to make the trade-off between wages and workplace freedom when they seek a job.\n\nThis theory supposes, unrealistically, that entry-level workers already know how well they will be treated when they apply for jobs at different workplaces, and that low-paid workers have ready access to decent working conditions in the first place. It\u2019s telling that the same workers who suffer the worst working conditions also suffer from massive wage theft. One study estimates that employers failed to pay $50 billion in legally mandated wages in one year. Two-thirds of workers in low-wage industries suffered wage theft, costing them nearly 15 percent of their total earnings. This is three times the amount of all other thefts in the United States.\n\nIf employers have such contempt for their employees that they steal their wages, how likely is it that they are making it up to them with better working conditions?\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to theorize that workers are better off under employer dictatorship, because managers supposedly know best to govern the workplace efficiently. But if efficiency means that workers are forced to pee in their pants, why shouldn\u2019t they have a say in whether such \u201cefficiency\u201d is worthwhile? The long history of American workers\u2019 struggles to get the right to use the bathroom at work \u2014 something long enjoyed by our European counterparts \u2014 says enough about economists\u2019 stunted notion of efficiency.\n\nMeanwhile, our false rhetoric of workers\u2019 \u201cchoice\u201d continues to obscure the ways the state is handing ever more power to workplace dictators. The Trump administration\u2019s Labor Department is working to roll back the Obama administration\u2019s expansion of overtime pay. It is giving a free pass to federal contractors who have violated workplace safety and federal wage and hours laws. It has canceled the paycheck transparency rule, making it harder for women to know when they are being paid less for the same work as men.\n\nPrivate government is arbitrary, unaccountable government. That\u2019s what most Americans are subject to at work. The history of democracy is the history of turning governance from a private matter into a public one. It has been about making government public \u2014 answerable to the interests of citizens and not just the interests of their rulers. It\u2019s time to apply the lessons we have learned from this history to the private government of the workplace. Workers deserve a voice not just on Capitol Hill but in Amazon warehouses, Silicon Valley technology companies, and meat-processing plants as well.\n\nElizabeth Anderson is the Arthur F.

The fall in the stock market after 2000 reduced CEO stock-related pay (e.g., options) and caused CEO compensation to tumble until 2002 and 2003. CEO compensation recovered to a level of 345.3 times worker pay by 2007, almost back to its 2000 level. The financial crisis in 2008 and accompanying stock market decline reduced CEO compensation after 2007\u20132008, as discussed above, and the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio fell in tandem. By 2014, the stock market had recouped all of the value it lost following the financial crisis. Similarly, CEO compensation had grown from its 2009 low, and the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio in 2014 had recovered to 303.4-to-1, a rise of 107.6 since 2009.\u201d \u201cSingle young people are getting poorer compared to the average population even those with dependent children, with stagnating disposable income and onerous living costs pressing down on prosperity.

From 1994 to 2013, Mexico\u2019s gross domestic product per capita has grown at a paltry rate of 0.89 percent per year.\u201d Additionally, \u201cDuring NAFTA, Mexico\u2019s economy grew much slower than almost every Latin American country. So to say that NAFTA has benefited the Mexican economy is also a myth. It has boosted trade and investment, but this has not translated into meaningful growth that generates jobs. One of the problems that NAFTA has generated is basically an exporting economy for transnational corporations, not for the Mexican industry per se.\u201d It turns out that not only did NAFTA, \u201cflood Mexico with imported corn and cheap grains from the United States,\u201d but \u201cit also destroyed Mexico\u2019s own industries,\u201d according to Perez-Rocha.\u201d\n\nWhere THE FUCK was Hollywood for that?

If a group of armed white protesters turned up in Cleveland would the police be asking for the open carry law to be temporarily revoked? What do yo think?\n\n The head of Cleveland\u2019s largest police union has just called on Ohio Gov. John Kasich to temporarily restrict the state\u2019s open carry gun laws and the Second Amendment during this week\u2019s Republican National Convention.\n\nJohn Kasich, Ohio Governer, has been asked by the head of Cleveland\u2019s largest police union to temporarily ban the open carry gun laws during this week\u2019s Republican National Convention due to the arrival of several armed black protesters!\n\nThis call comes as members of various Black \u201cOpen Carry\u201d and self-defense organizations began arriving in the city.\n\nWhen various \u201cgun rights\u201d groups, with predominantly pro-Republican agendas and predominantly Caucasian members said they planned to show up, there was still no call from the police. Suddenly, as more and more African American armed protesters began checking in on the streets of Cleveland, the police made the call to the governor.\n\n\u201cWe are sending a letter to Gov. Kasich requesting assistance from him. He could very easily do some kind of executive order or something \u2013 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s constitutional or not at this point,\u201d Stephen Loomis, president of Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, audaciously said.\n\nOhio police, like police in every other state, are sworn to uphold not only the federal and state constitutions, but also the laws of the state they work in. This was a clear call for the police to write the laws themselves, on the fly.\n\n\u201cThey can fight about it after the RNC or they can lift it after the RNC, but I want him to absolutely outlaw open-carry in Cuyahoga County until this RNC is over,\u201d he continued.\n\nState law in Ohio allows legal firearm owners to carry their weapons in public. In fact, this is in the Ohio state constitution itself. There\u2019s no getting around that, even by a proposed executive order.\n\nMore astonishingly, this shows how little even the higher ups in the Cleveland police understand the way the law actually works.\n\nWith the small exception of a so-called \u201csecure zone\u201d set up inside and around the Quicken Loans Arena, protesters are legally allowed to walk around the city \u2013 including within its 1.7 square mile regulated \u201cevent zone\u201d \u2013 with any firearm that is legal in the state.\n\nKasich, for his part, responding to the request, saying: \u201cOhio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested.\u201d"}, "http://m.startribune.com/case-file-in-philando-castile-shooting-to-be-made-public-today/429659263/": {"title": "Case file in Philando Castile shooting released, dashcam video shows shooting", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://m.startribune.com/case-file-in-philando-castile-shooting-to-be-made-public-today/429659263/", "text": "Days after Jeronimo Yanez was acquitted in the killing of Philando Castile, authorities released thousands of pages of investigative reports and dramatic dashcam footage showing how a routine traffic stop turned deadly in seconds.\n\nIt was the first view outside the courtroom of the footage of St. Anthony police officer Yanez firing seven shots into Castile\u2019s car last year, killing him as viewers watched the aftermath on Facebook Live. The July 6 shooting thrust Minnesota into the national debate over police use of force and racial profiling.\n\nDocuments released Tuesday also revealed that Yanez couldn\u2019t provide investigators with a detailed description of the driver of the car he pursued, thinking he resembled a suspect in a recent robbery.\n\nYanez spoke to investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) the day after the shooting, explaining that he pulled Castile over because of a nonworking brake light and in order to check whether he was one of two men from an armed robbery four days earlier.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know whether Castile\u2019s passenger, girlfriend Diamond Reynolds, was a man or a woman \u2014 only that the passenger wore a hat.\n\n\u201cI just knew that they were both African American, and the driver, uh, appeared to me that he appeared to match the, uh, physical description of the one of our suspects from the strong arm robbery, gunpoint,\u201d Yanez said in the interview.\n\n\u201cUm, it was a [sigh], I can\u2019t remember the height, weight but I remember that it was, the male had dreadlocks around shoulder length,\u201d Yanez said. \u201c\u2026And then just kind of distinct facial features with like a kind of like a wide-set nose.\u201d\n\nThe audio recording of Yanez\u2019s one-hour interview was never played by prosecutors during his three-week trial. Prosecutors sought to introduce it late in the trial, but the judge said no. Jurors requested the full BCA transcript of the interview during deliberations but were denied by the judge. The interview also showed that Yanez frequently mentioned smelling burnt marijuana in the car. The issue featured prominently in his defense at trial. Six seconds after Castile told Yanez he had a firearm, Yanez shot him. Castile\u2019s permit to carry was later found in his wallet.\n\n\u201cI thought, I was gonna die,\u201d Yanez later recounted about the moments leading up to the shooting, \u201cand I thought if he\u2019s, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care does he give about me. And, I let off the rounds and then after the rounds were off, the little girls [sic] was screaming.\u201d\n\nThe video released by the BCA and the Ramsey County attorney\u2019s office starts about 9:05 p.m. as Yanez activates his squad lights to pull Castile over on Larpenteur Avenue near Fry Street in Falcon Heights. A little over a minute later, Yanez fired seven bullets.\n\nTyrone Terrill, president of the African-American Leadership Council, said the video could further damage community-police relations.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Terrill said minutes after viewing the video. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to remain calm on this one. You have a right to be outraged. You have a right to be angry. And I would be disappointed if you weren\u2019t outraged, if you weren\u2019t angry. It raises the question \u2014 how will you ever get a guilty verdict?\u201d\n\nBut some authorities cautioned viewers not to consider the video as a complete record of the events that night.\n\nState Rep. Nick Zerwas, R-Elk River, called it a \u201ctough, tough video to watch.\u201d Watching it, he said, \u201cjust reinforces the speed of the event.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s these very short but very clear verbal commands to not reach for it. And once you start down that path and the officer interprets noncompliance, it\u2019s going to play out very, very quickly,\u201d said Zerwas, a vocal advocate for law enforcement at the Capitol. \u201cLooking at that video in context of all the information, you can see how the jury could reach that conclusion and understand why deliberations went on for all those days.\u201d\n\nAndy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said the video provides context \u201cto an incredibly tragic story,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t see inside the vehicle and, most importantly, we can\u2019t feel officer Yanez\u2019s fear,\u201d Skoogman said. \u201cObviously, no video can ever show the level of one\u2019s fear, which is a purely subjective measure, differing from one person and one situation to the next. That\u2019s what makes this case so difficult and open to such emotional debate.\u201d\n\nAt a St. Paul community conversation set up in the wake of the verdict, 150 people gathered with counselors present. While the pain from the verdict was still fresh, they said, the video reopened wounds.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about that being me,\u201d said Donte Curtis, 24, who cried when watching the video. \u201cI was thinking about that being me.\u201d\n\nAmong the data were more than 2,000 pages of documents, photos of Castile\u2019s bloodied and bullet-riddled car and his autopsy, as well as interviews with Yanez, officer Joseph Kauser, his backup that night, and Reynolds.\n\nYanez met with two special agents from the BCA at 1:42 p.m. the day after the shooting, accompanied by two attorneys, Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler.\n\nIn the interview, Yanez said he was nearly three hours into his shift when he saw a white car pass and thought the driver appeared to match the description of one of the robbers.\n\nWhen Yanez pulled the car over and approached, he smelled burnt marijuana, he told the agents. He didn\u2019t tell this to the driver because, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to scare him or have him react in a defensive manner,\u201d so he told Castile he had a nonworking brake light.\n\nYanez said Castile wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye and was mumbling. He asked Castile for his license, and as Castile reached down he said he had a firearm, Yanez told the agents. Yanez said he repeatedly told him not to reach for the gun.\n\n\u201cIt appeared to me that he had no regard to what I was saying. He didn\u2019t care what I was saying. He still reached down.\u201d\n\nYanez recalled that Castile kept his left hand on the steering wheel, and the placement of his shoulder blocked Yanez\u2019s sightline to Castile\u2019s right hand. It was at this time that he feared Castile may be reaching for the gun in his waistband or perhaps between the seats. He wondered if Castile may have kept the gun for protection from a drug dealer or someone trying to \u201crip\u201d from him.\n\n\u201cAnd at that point I was scared and I was in fear for my life and my partner\u2019s life,\u201d he told the agents. He thought he saw Castile grab something and pull it away from his right thigh. \u201cI know he had an object \u2014 and it was dark,\u201d he said. He thought he saw a gun.\n\nBut in answer to a question about what he saw in Castile\u2019s hands just after he was shot, Yanez said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing anything in his hands.\u201d\n\nIn her interview with BCA investigators, Reynolds described Yanez as \u201cjittery\u201d during the traffic stop. She said Castile was trying to retrieve his wallet from his back pocket to get his license.\n\n\u201cAnd he shot, pop, pop, pop, pop. And why did it take for that many times for him to shoot somebody?\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cBlatantly, in front of two women like that? For no apparent reason because he was havin\u2019 hard times gettin\u2019 to his license and registration.\u201d\n\nReynolds told the investigators that marijuana was in Castile\u2019s car, but that it was hers. She said Castile carried a gun to protect himself and his family. She also worried about investigators destroying evidence.\n\n\u201cThey kill, he killed him. So now what? Where do we go from here? Because there\u2019s gonna be lawsuits in order. There\u2019s discrimination in, there\u2019s racism. There\u2019s a lot of things that\u2019s gonna play now because of this.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the interview, one of the BCA investigators informed Reynolds that Castile had died.\n\n\u201cHe took him away from us,\u201d she said, crying. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nStaff writers Brandon Stahl and Sarah Jarvis contributed to this report."}, "http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/american-anarchists-ypg-kurdish-militia-syria-isis-islamic-state-w466069": {"title": "The Anarchists vs. the Islamic State", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/american-anarchists-ypg-kurdish-militia-syria-isis-islamic-state-w466069", "text": "On the front lines of Syria with the young American radicals fighting ISIS\n\nOn the morning of his first battle, Brace Belden was underdressed for the cold and shaky from a bout of traveler's diarrhea. His Kurdish militia unit was camped out on the front line with ISIS, 30 miles from Raqqa, in Syria. Fighters stood around campfires of gas-soaked trash, boiling water for tea, their only comfort besides tobacco. \"I've never been so dirty in my life,\" Belden recalls. When the time came to roll out, he loaded a clip into his Kalashnikov and climbed into a makeshift battlewagon, a patchwork of tank and truck parts armored with scrap metal and poured concrete. Belden took a selfie inside its rusty cabin and posted it online with the caption \"Wow this freakin taxi stinks.\"\n\nThe rest of the militia piled into an assortment of minivans, garbage trucks and bulldozers, and rode south into territory ISIS had held for more than three years. Belden was manning a swivel-mounted machine gun, the parched landscape barely visible through the rising dust, when he spotted a car packed with explosives revving across the desert toward the Kurdish column. Before he could shoot, an American fighter jet lacerated the sky and an explosion erupted where the car had been, shaking the earth for miles around.\n\n\n\nIt was November 6th, 2016. The Kurdish militia known as the YPG \u2013 a Kurmanji acronym for People's Protection Units \u2013 had commenced a major offensive to liberate the city that serves as the global headquarters for ISIS. The YPG was backed by U.S. air power and fighting alongside a coalition of Arab and Assyrian militias. Also within their ranks, though scantly reported, was a group of about 75 hardcore leftists, anarchists and communists from Europe and America, Belden among them, fighting to defend a socialist enclave roughly the size of Massachusetts.\n\nBelden, who is 27, started tweeting photos of the front shortly after arriving in Syria in October. The first widely shared image showed him crouched in his YPG uniform, wearing thick Buddy Holly glasses, a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, a stray puppy in one hand and a sniper rifle in the other. \"To misquote Celine,\" the post read, \"when you're in, you're in.\" He has since amassed 19,000 followers under the handle PissPigGranddad, puzzling the Internet with a combination of leftist invective and scurrilous bro humor. Tweets like \"Heading to the Quandil Mountains to lecture the PKK about entitlement reform\" are followed by \"The dude with the lamb bailed so now we're fucked for dinner.\"\n\nBelden had no military experience before joining the YPG. He lived in San Francisco, where he arranged flowers for a living. Before that, he was a self-described lumpenproletariat, a lowlife punk and petty criminal with a heroin habit who started reading Marx and Lenin seriously in rehab. Once sober, he got involved in leftist causes, marching for tenants' rights, blocking evictions, protesting police brutality. As he prepared for the Middle East, his girlfriend thought he was going to do humanitarian work. She was \"not stoked,\" Belden says, to learn that he planned to fight alongside the YPG.\n\nThe first phase of the Raqqa offensive was a mission to take Tal Saman, a satellite village of 10,000 people 17 miles north of Raqqa proper. \"We pushed up to Tal Saman till we had it surrounded on a half circle,\" Belden says, \"then we just bombarded the shit out of it.\" Refugees poured out of the village, seeking protection behind Kurdish lines. \"Hundreds of civilians coming across for days in a row,\" Belden says. At night, his unit stayed in whatever building they'd just taken, camped out on rooftops in the excruciating cold. \"The first week we were out it was awful,\" Belden says. The stepmother of a fellow volunteer from the U.S. had gotten Belden's number. She kept texting to make sure they were eating enough.\n\nThe march on Raqqa slowed to a halt after two weeks, as the YPG consolidated its hold over a string of liberated villages. The YPG controls a region of 4 million people in northern Syria known as Rojava. Its tens of thousands of motivated fighters have been battling ISIS for five years. American as well as French warplanes have been covering their maneuvers with airstrikes for the past two, forcing ISIS off the roads and highways and open desert, and back into the urban strongholds of Mosul and Raqqa. Now, the Kurds are kicking the door down in both cities.\n\nBut the YPG is not your typical ethnic or sectarian faction. Its fighters are loyal to an imprisoned guerrilla leader who was once a communist but now espouses the same kind of secular, feminist, anarcho-libertarianism as Noam Chomsky or the activists of Occupy Wall Street. The Kurds are implementing these ideals in Rojava, and that has attracted a ragtag legion of leftist internationals, like Belden, who have come from nearly every continent to help the YPG beat ISIS and establish an anarchist collective amid the rubble of the war \u2013 a \"stateless democracy\" equally opposed to Islamic fundamentalism and capitalist modernity. They call it the Rojava Revolution, and they want you.\n\nForeigners interested in joining the YPG receive instructions by encrypted e-mail to fly to Sulaymaniyah, Iraq, a city controlled by a socialist opposition party sympathetic to the Rojava Revolution. Although volunteers are welcome, it's not easy to reach the YPG. To the south is ISIS. To the west is the Free Syrian Army, a disorganized coalition of warlords and mercenaries dominated by Al Qaeda's Nusra Front. To the north is Turkey, the archenemy of Kurdish independence, whose conservative, Islamist government is bombing the YPG. To the east is the Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq \u2013 for years, its military force, the Peshmerga, permitted volunteers to cross into Syria. But last year, under pressure from Turkey, the KRG closed the only bridge over the Tigris, completing the total blockade on Rojava.\n\nMy assignment was to get inside Rojava and report on the Western leftists taking part in the fight. From Sulaymaniyah, I traveled to Kirkuk, Iraq, where I met with a Peshmerga general who ordered four of his men to smuggle me across the blockade disguised as a fellow fighter. We made it through a series of regional checkpoints and arrived at a hardscrabble guerrilla camp in the foothills of Mount Sinjar, a forbidden zone controlled by the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK. I spent a cold night huddled in a grimy kitchen, befogged with eye-watering quantities of cigarette smoke, while young PKK militants lectured me on the crisis of late capitalism and the American media's sexual exploitation of women.\n\n\n\nOf all the armed factions in the region, the PKK is the most crucial to understanding the Rojava Revolution. Beginning in 1978, the PKK waged a communist insurgency against the government of Turkey, and was designated a terrorist group by the U.S. in 1997. Two years later, Turkish security forces captured the party's founder, Abdullah \u00d6calan. Sentenced to life on an island prison, \u00d6calan underwent a political conversion. He gave up Marx and Lenin and started reading about anarchism, feminism and ecology, especially the works of Murray Bookchin, a libertarian socialist who used to rub shoulders with Bernie Sanders in Vermont.\n\nIn 2011, \u00d6calan wrote a pamphlet called \"Democratic Confederalism,\" which outlines a sort of Athenian-style direct democracy based on voluntary participation in neighborhood councils, placing a special emphasis on the equality of women. The 47-page blueprint for a society without a formal government might never have mattered had the regime of Bashar al-Assad not pulled its forces from northern Syria in 2012, allowing local Kurdish militias \u2013 allied with the PKK and devoted to \u00d6calan \u2013 to take over. The Syrian Kurds, under the protection of the YPG, declared Rojava's autonomy and adopted a constitution based on \u00d6calan's \"Democratic Confederalism.\" For the first time since the Spanish Civil War, anarchists controlled a nation-size territory, and Rojava soon became a celebrated cause of the international left.\n\nFrom Mount Sinjar, I rode toward the Raqqa front in a minivan full of fighters, including a pair of Yazidi girls, 16 and 18 years old, both in camouflage uniforms, one with an eye patch, the other cradling a sprained arm. In August 2014, ISIS massacred thousands of Yazidi Kurds in the Sinjar district of Iraq and dragged the women to the slave market at Raqqa. The survivors retreated to the top of Mount Sinjar, where they were held under siege until President Obama ordered the first American airstrikes against ISIS. That allowed the Yazidis to escape into Rojava. When I asked the pair in the van about their injuries, they looked at me like I was stupid. \"Daesh,\" the older one said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS.\n\nWe arrived at a YPG base on a hilltop just across the border in Syria. The militiamen were gathered around campfires, and it seemed no one was in command. True to its anarchist ideology, the YPG is loosely organized, without ranks; the universal gender-neutral honorific is heval\u00ea, or friend. It elects its leaders directly, and even a general must wash his own clothes and take his turn cooking. It has an all-female fighting brigade, the Women's Protection Units, or YPJ, and command positions are jointly occupied by a man from the YPG and a woman from the YPJ. Its troops are lightly armed and go into battle without body armor or helmets or even boots, just sneakers and Kalashnikovs, wearing the black flowery headscarves typical of Rojava, which the men took up wearing in solidarity with the women.\n\nDespite its radical ideology and connection with the banned PKK, the YPG has forged an effective alliance with the U.S. military (though the Trump administration has signaled a willingness to dissolve it). As of now, there are more than 500 American commandos embedded with the YPG, advising the Kurds on tactics, calling in airstrikes and disarming explosives. On November 24th, the day I arrived in Syria, a Navy bomb-disposal technician was killed in a town called Ayn Issa, a place I knew by name. It was about 150 miles from Sinjar, nearly to Raqqa. I was headed there to meet up with Belden.\n\nAll volunteers arriving in Rojava attend a month-long training course at a place called the Academy, an oil facility with four concrete buildings, running water, intermittent electricity, a laundry line and a potato patch. I met a dozen recruits when I visited, mostly Germans and Italians, but also two Americans, an Englishman, a Finn, a Spanish Basque and a Tibetan citizen of Hong Kong. In the barracks, they slept five to a room on floor mats, their rucksacks and rifles stacked in the corners. At dawn they went for a run in uniform, carrying Kalashnikovs. The rest of the day, recruits attended classes in weapons training, anarcho-feminist ideology and rudimentary Kurmanji.\n\nThose already trained, many of whom had already fought, sat around soaking up the few hours of winter sunshine, with little to do but smoke cigarettes and drink tea. One of these was Karim Franceschi, a bearded 27-year-old Italian who was among the first leftists in Rojava. In September 2014, ISIS controlled most of the border with Turkey. Only the city of Kobani held out, and ISIS sent its most hardened foreign fighters to take it. The YPG's heroic defense brought fame in the international press. In October 2014, Franceschi and a cohort of Italian communists met with Kobani officials in exile with the idea of volunteering in some kind of medical capacity. \"They were so desperate,\" Franceschi recalled. \"They didn't give a shit about medicine. They wanted fighters. I couldn't say no.\"\n\nFranceschi was vague about his background, but wore a Mao pin, owned a fortune in Bitcoin and spoke seven languages, including Arabic and Kurmanji. With no military experience, he was sent to the front line, where Kurdish defenders were outnumbered perhaps five to one. \"I felt scared as hell,\" he said. \"I knew there were Chechen terrorists, crazy fighters from ISIS. At night, we heard them speaking on the radio, more in Russian than in Arabic.\" For the next three months, he never slept more than two hours at a stretch. \"I was lucky,\" he said. \"I survived long enough to learn how to fight.\" ISIS made the tactical error of pulverizing the city to ruins, which forced its fighters out of their stolen tanks to move on foot. \"That's when the fight got real,\" Franceschi said.\n\n\n\nMore foreigners arrived, all leftists, and they formed a sniper unit. \"This was the first internationalist team,\" Franceschi said, showing me a photo of himself in Kobani alongside a Spanish anarchist, a British Kurd and Keith Broomfield, the first American known to have died in the ranks of the YPG. \"A lot of comrades were martyred during that time,\" Franceschi said. \"There was a lot of violence. But believe me, there was so much warmth. The conversation, the intimacy that you get knowing that you're fighting for something and that you're in the right. There were no ranks. You could go to your general, slap him behind his head and ask him for a cigarette. It was amazing. I had the time of my life, even though I lost my best friends there.\"\n\n\n\nFranceschi was back in Syria for the Raqqa operation. It would be his third tour in as many years, but he was disappointed in the international turnout. During the Spanish Civil War, something like 60,000 foreigners fought for the anarchists and communists against the fascists. In the Syrian Civil War, Franceschi said, \"the Western volunteers are basically a joke, while ISIS has tens of thousands from the Middle East, thousands from Europe. So what does that say about us?\"\n\nThe sun was setting behind the pump jacks. We drifted over to the mess hall, a Spartan dining room hung with posters of foreign martyrs and portraits of \u00d6calan, who looks like a friendly version of Saddam Hussein. In one corner was a shelf of socialist literature. A trio of Italians were in the kitchen, shouting and brandishing knives over steaming pots and pans. The rest of the volunteers were seated at the table, tearing off pieces of flatbread to grab olives and slices of tomato from communal platters. The conversation was raucous, and a debate boiled over on the subject of toilet paper \u2013 specifically, the absence thereof in the Middle East, where pots of water are used instead.\n\n\"Some people here,\" Franceschi confided in a low tone, \"still have this bourgeois thing for wet wipes.\"\n\n\"Bourgeois?\" interjected a jocular Italian with a knife scar across one cheek. \"Is bourgeois, clean your ass?\" He raised a hand. \"I don't want a revolution.\"\n\nThis was Dilsoz (a Kurdish war moniker; many leftists refused to give their real names because of laws against taking part in foreign conflicts). He was 29 years old. Occupation: thief. He grew up in a squat house outside Rome and, despite never finishing school and having limited English, could hold forth on Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony: \"The dominant class transmit his beliefs, his values, to the proletarian class,\" he said, subtly swiping two cigarettes from my pack. \"The poorest persons, now they argue like a capitalist, the same person that oppress him, that send his mother to the factory.\"\n\nWith his scars and jailhouse tattoos, Dilsoz stood out among the other volunteers, most of whom were middle-class and educated, like Zerde\u015ft (also a war moniker), a blue-eyed boy of 20 whose father is a doctor in Bavaria. Back home, Zerde\u015ft hung out with a crowd of \"bobos\" \u2013 bourgeois bohemians, rich hipsters, professional-class liberals \u2013 who talked up the Rojava Revolution but never did anything to support it. One day he told himself, \"OK, now you have to stop bullshitting.\"\n\n\n\nThe platters of salty noodles and mysterious canned meat were cleared, but no one was in a hurry to be excused. In the absence of beer or wine, the inevitable tea was served, the 10th of the day, and billows of tobacco smoke churned above the table.\n\nI turned to a brainy-looking 31-year-old whose Kurdish alias was Agit. \"Before coming here, I had a very good management job,\" he said with a German lisp. \"I tried to have a normal life because my family and my girlfriend expected that for me, a capitalist life, but I hate that. Especially when I see that most of the people in the world are poor, and our wealth can only exist because they are poor.\"\n\nLike Franceschi, he had come back to Rojava for the Raqqa operation. His first tour had coincided with an influx of a different class of volunteers: British and American veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, many of them evangelical Christians, who came to kill ISIS and were ignorant of the Kurds' revolutionary politics. They bickered among themselves and caused problems for the Kurds; a few of them did horrible things. Three separate times I was told of a British veteran known only as Tim, a crack shot, and by all accounts a cheerful guy, who enjoyed tasting the blood of the slain and was once seen gnawing on a severed foot.\n\n\"This whole thing is a magnet for idiots, psychopaths, sociopaths, plain assholes,\" Agit said. These days, things are more organized. There is a German operative at the safehouse in Sulaymaniyah who vets volunteers as they arrive, weeding out the lunatics and selecting for leftists, who tend to get along better and keep a lower profile.\n\nThe only U.S. military veteran at the Academy was a young Chicagoan with Ecuadorian roots who went by the alias Alan. He had served in the Marine Corps but was never deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, so when he got out of the service he made his way to Rojava. On one mission to liberate a village, he was shot in the arm and hand, he told me. The Kurds gave him an inappropriately low dose of ketamine and he lay on the battlefield conscious and tripping balls. \"We respect a guy like Alan,\" Franceschi said.\n\nAs for the pacifist liberals back home in Europe and America, \"They're not truly committed to anything,\" Franceschi said, pulling out his phone to read a Murray Bookchin quote. \"'Today we are turning inward: We are looking for personal definition, personal improvement, personal achievement, personal enlightenment.' This is the left today in the world. Even those here, many anarchists, they come here and they want to be amazed and live the Kurdish ways. You're not here on a trip, man. It's not your personal voyage. There is a war. There is a revolution. And they need fighters.\"\n\nHitching rides around Rojava, I was appalled by the environmental degradation. The most educated people throw their garbage directly out the window, and flattened trash accumulates like leaf litter in the forest. They don't have a proper oil refinery, so caustic black exhaust wafts over the streets in visible strata. The only animals are dreadlocked bovids grazing knee-deep in trash, wretched chickens molting in cages, and stray dogs, which I knew from many stories were not unaccustomed to the taste of human flesh. And yet, making your way through the foot traffic and beeping motorcycles of a bazaar, the sidewalks crowded with crates of fruits and vegetables, cellphone shops, money-changers and tractor mechanics, everything draped in a cat's cradle of electrical wires, there is a peculiar charm, an aura of intrigue that is heightened by the jangly Kurdish ballads on every radio.\n\n\n\nOn November 29th, I arrived in Ayn Issa, a crossroads town on the desert plain where the YPG coalition had its field headquarters for the Raqqa offensive. The people had all fled, and I found the unit I was looking for living in an abandoned house with a walled courtyard. Out stepped Belden, whose vaguely comical countenance I recognized from Twitter. He lit a cigarette and we sat in plastic chairs on the patio, where men and women from other units were constantly arriving to shake hands, kiss on both cheeks, hang out for a while, and leave.\n\nGrowing up in San Francisco, Belden never had money: \"I was a troubled teen. I went to five different high schools. I always worked shitty jobs. I guess I should have gone to college \u2013 but a lot of good that did other guys.\" He protested the Iraq War at age 13 but later forgot about politics, and formed a band called Warkrime. \"I was a punk for a long time, and that doesn't make you into the best dude,\" he said. Photos from this period show him hanging around grungy bars, smoking, drinking, mooning the camera, holding a gun to his head, sitting passed out on a couch. \"Don't ever get addicted to drugs,\" he said. Eventually, he landed in jail. \"I got picked up for possession,\" he explained, \"and I had a previous warrant for assault after I got in this weird shoving match with a guy.\" He was released and later survived a heroin overdose but ended up with a $2,000 bill for a five-minute ambulance ride, a debt he could never pay off on minimum wage. \"I had to become a sober dude,\" he said, \"a straight-edge.\"\n\nPolitically, though, rehab further radicalized him. \"All I did was read books on far-left theory,\" he said. \"I started to understand intellectually what I already understood emotionally.\" In late 2012, he came across an article on the declaration of Kurdish autonomy in Syria, which led him to \u00d6calan's manifesto. Rojava has never been mainstream news, but over the past few years the fringes of the Internet have produced a stream of glamorous war imagery: red stars on black flags, Molotov cocktails, Banksy-style murals on bullet-riddled walls, and sexy female fighters posing with Kalashnikovs atop piles of rubble. \"Grab your laptop and come to Rojava now,\" said an early version of RojavaPlan.com, a recruiting website affiliated with the hacker collective Anonymous. \"Burn down government institutions, form a commune and grow some potatoes between the rubble of the old world.\"\n\nTo Belden, it looked like a post-9/11 reprise of the Spanish Civil War. In place of the anarchists and communists of the Popular Front, you had the Syrian Kurds, with their nearly identical anti-capitalist ideology; and in place of Franco, the Catholic fascist dictator, you had ISIS, the ultimate religious conservatives. The motto of the Spanish Republic was \u00a1No Pasar\u00e1n! The motto of Rojava: No State/No Caliphate.\n\nAfter four years of following from the sidelines, Belden started sending e-mails to the administrators of a blog called YPG International, asking how he could join. When they finally replied, \"I kind of freaked out,\" he said. But once he arrived in Sulaymaniyah, everything was taken care of. \"If you're a white twentysomething taking a cab from the airport by yourself,\" he said, \"the cab drivers just know.\"\n\nWe got up to walk around the base, a cinderblock building with metal doors flung open to the elements, a dozen pairs of shoes on the threshold and an equal number of Kalashnikovs lying around. The courtyard was a wreckage of trash and debris, including the shell of a burned car. On the rooftop, three tattered YPG pennants fluttered in the wind. Raqqa lay 30 miles to the south. From time to time, dull concussions thudded on the horizon.\n\n\"Did you meet the little Jewish nerd?\" asked Belden, who is Jewish himself; he used to have a Star of David tattooed on the knuckle of his middle finger, but had a spade tattooed over it before coming to the Middle East. He took me inside to a carpeted room with sleeping mats and pillows lining the walls and introduced me to Lucas Chapman, a skinny American in Coke-bottle glasses warming his hands on a stove heater.\n\nChapman claims to remember nothing that happened before his 16th birthday. He hated high school in Dahlonega, Georgia, a town of 6,000 people just south of the Chattahoochee National Forest. \"I just wanted to get the hell out,\" he said. He attended American University in Washington, D.C., where he majored in Jewish history and immersed himself in socialist theory. \"As long as I can remember, I've been interested in leftism,\" he said. He worked part-time for a startup called Postmates, an Uber-like company of underemployed couriers. \"On one of my last deliveries I brought some rich prick two MacBook Pros,\" Chapman said. \"He was barefoot in his underwear, and he literally wrote in zero dollars and zero cents for a tip. How does anyone do that?\"\n\nAfter days like that, Chapman would go home, fire up a bowl and spend the evening studying Kurmanji and scrolling through RojavaPlan.com. He left for Sulaymaniyah in September 2016 and spent a sleepless first night at a designated hotel, sweat seeping from every pore, his mind racing. \"What the hell am I doing here?\" he thought. Noon the next day he was taken to a different room, where at least there was another American: Belden. That afternoon they were driven to a camp in the Zagros Mountains, and that same night they hiked across the border, a six-hour march without water, suffering under heavy packs, tripping over rocks and brambles. The sun had not yet risen when Chapman first set foot in Syria. It was the morning of his 21st birthday.\n\nA tall, scruffy Danish guy set down his Kalashnikov and joined us, introducing himself as Tommy M\u00f8rck. He was in his thirties and had WHY? tattooed across the four knuckles of one hand. He grew up in an unstable home and spent his twenties on the move, living in different countries, attending various universities, working unrelated jobs. \"I never could find anything that could stick,\" he said. \"Not people, not occupations, not places.\" He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and suffered from heavy depression until the day he realized that there was nothing wrong with his mind; it was the modern world that was sick. He gave up on the system, went on unemployment benefits and started working 50 hours a week for a Danish green party. Around that time, Syria came to Denmark in the form of thousands of refugees. \"They were treated like animals,\" M\u00f8rck said. Within a year of discovering RojavaPlan.com, he was aboard a flight to Sulaymaniyah.\n\nAt the Academy, M\u00f8rck met Belden and Chapman, and after training, all three of them were assigned to a heavy-weapons unit at Ayn Issa. Just two days later, the YPG coalition announced the start of the Raqqa offensive. \"We were surprised,\" M\u00f8rck said. They had expected to spend months doing guard duty, sheltered from real danger. Instead, M\u00f8rck said, \"we fired the first shots of the Raqqa operation.\" The three of them were put to manning machine guns, Belden riding inside the makeshift tank, Chapman and M\u00f8rck straddling the beds of Hilux gun trucks. ISIS didn't put up much of a fight. \"Once they saw we were coming, they just ran,\" M\u00f8rck said. They could only see the enemy \u2013 \"dudes walking around with huge beards,\" Chapman said \u2013 through binoculars. American commandos, snake-eating JSOC types without insignia, were milling around with the Kurds, and M\u00f8rck said he talked to uniformed American marines engaged in actual combat, lobbing mortars at ISIS. \"But only until 6 o'clock,\" M\u00f8rck said, \"because then the Kurds want to sleep, and mortars are really loud.\"\n\n\n\nAs the YPG forces entered Tal Saman, they found a warehouse with a car-bomb assembly line and a blood-stained man cage. They picked through rubble mixed with skulls and spines, and stripped expensive gear off ISIS carcasses. \"Technically, I did a war crime, because I peed on a dead person,\" Belden said. \"I didn't mean to.\" There were booby traps everywhere. Chapman was standing outside a house when the windows exploded with dirt and smoke. A Kurd stumbled out coughing, coated in dust, and immediately lit up a cigarette. Two more emerged carrying a fourth, whose foot had been blown off by a land mine hidden in an upstairs bedroom. By November 20th, Tal Saman was completely secured.\n\nI visited Tal Saman 10 days after that, a drizzly morning in the little village of collapsed one-story houses and wrecked buildings bristling with twisted rebar. Even the trees were shot up, shorn of upper branches, bark shredded. The actual front was a small metal bridge over an irrigation canal, south of town. A dirt road vanished into the fog on the other side, where the spurious caliphate lay. A throng of refugees was gathered at the foot of the bridge, Arab families with truckloads of household goods, flocks of sodden sheep and goats, cattle and camels, motorcycles and tractors and cars. The people were wrapped in blankets and cloaks, wreathed in the steam and smoke of campfires. There were no fortifications, only a rangy squad of fierce-looking Kurds standing guard. Women in black burqas were beseeching them to let their families across.\n\nA convoy of Land Cruisers and gun trucks pulled up, and a group of bearded British commandos got out and shook hands with the Kurds. One of them took out his phone and captured a photo of the refugees, provoking one of the women in black to throw up her hands and wail in misery.\n\n\"What's she saying?\" the British commando asked his translator.\n\n\"She says, 'You take our picture, but you don't let us cross.'\"\n\nGarbled excitement came over the YPG radios. A Kurd with long hair hoisted a belt-fed machine gun and fired on the ISIS side of the road. Orange tracers floated forward into the mist, but I couldn't see what he was shooting at. The refugees barely reacted. ISIS had retreated but continued to dispatch car bombs, and lone infiltrators could penetrate far behind Kurdish lines. My local colleague said the commander wanted us to leave and ushered me into his Daewoo. We drove 15 miles over cratered roads back to Ayn Issa, where the bulk of the YPG force, including Belden and Chapman and M\u00f8rck, had pulled back to await the next phase of the offensive.\n\nWhile fighting ISIS along a 300-mile front, the YPG is also battling the Turkish Army on its western flank, especially around Manbij, the third-largest city in Rojava. The day I met up with Belden, a Turkish airstrike west of Manbij killed a 27-year-old American named Michael Israel, an anarchist from Lodi, California, who had recently posted a photo of himself on Facebook wearing a YPG uniform and stomping on a Confederate flag. At the time, he was the 20th foreign volunteer to die and the fifth American, but the first to be killed by Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States.\n\nIn the past, Turkish officials have vowed not to distinguish between foreigners and Kurds, whom they consider terrorists. I asked the Department of State if it had anything to say about Turkey killing an American citizen serving in an American-backed militia alongside American military personnel. A spokeswoman would not go on record other than to point to the Department of State's March 2016 travel warning, which said that private citizens who fight in Syria could face criminal charges. I asked the Department of Justice if it would prosecute American YPG volunteers. A spokesman said it would not comment on hypothetical cases. But \"regardless of its legality,\" he added, joining the YPG \"is a bad idea and we strongly discourage it.\"\n\nBelden, Chapman and M\u00f8rck were more worried about surviving Raqqa than any potential criminal liability. Raqqa is 20 times larger than Tal Saman, with a population in the hundreds of thousands. ISIS has had four years to build and dig, and the ground is likely riddled with tunnels, the buildings booby-trapped to the last. \"Mines,\" Belden said. \"Mines everywhere.\"\n\nThere is also a question of manpower: The YPG claims 50,000 fighters, but armed forces are prone to inflate their numbers, and the front line seemed oddly depopulated, even at Ayn Issa. \"There's, like, 40 of us,\" Belden joked. Was it possible the Kurds were still as desperate for able bodies as they'd been when Franceschi arrived in Kobani? I pushed Belden for a serious number. \"A thousand people on this front is a generous estimate,\" Belden said. The others nodded. No one knows how many ISIS has; many have died in airstrikes but thousands remain, possibly tens of thousands, concentrated in Raqqa.\n\n\n\n\"We're going to die there,\" Chapman said, cracking open a sunflower seed. It was late at night by this time. The tea had gone cold. The Kurds had rolled up in blankets against the wall, though the television in the corner was still flickering. I looked at Belden, who laughed and said, \"We're definitely going to die.\"\n\n\n\nIt's impossible to say whether the Rojava Revolution has succeeded as a model of civil society because the country is so thoroughly mobilized for war. There are soldiers and police everywhere, fires burning in the streets. The bullet-riddled buildings are drafty and cold, with only sporadic electricity. The Kurds' chief pleasure, though, aside from tea and tobacco, seems to be one another's company. Their food is monotonous \u2013 bread, tomatoes, beans, sometimes mutton \u2013 but every meal is eaten communally, with second portions, and the place of honor, forced on any guest present. I was there two weeks and barely spent any money. I shared in whatever people were eating and slept wherever they slept. They are desperate for imports, yet if I ever so much as took a dollar bill from my wallet the Kurds would ward it off like a talisman of evil. I saw no rich people, no corporations, no banks, no big houses, no fancy cars, no one homeless or begging or starving. The people were of one class and improbably cheerful. They were united in support of the YPG and seemed to worship \u00d6calan, whose portrait hung in every building.\n\nNot long after leaving Syria, I got a message from M\u00f8rck. Belden and Chapman had been transferred to another unit a little down the line. On December 13th, around two in the morning, M\u00f8rck awoke to the sound of shooting. He knew the sentries enjoyed popping off rounds as a practical joke, but this sounded like it was just outside. He grabbed his rifle and pushed open the door to the foyer, which reeked of gunsmoke. When he peered into the courtyard, a Kurd standing in the adjacent doorway hissed at him, waving him back: ISIS was inside the compound.\n\nThere was another spate of gunfire and M\u00f8rck backed away from the doors with his rifle raised. He was crouched against the wall with a broken window at his back. Should he cover the window or the doors? Either way, he would be exposed. His dilemma was solved by an explosion, an all-engulfing concussion that shook the concrete wall like a car crashing into it. Sediment rained down and a high-pitched tone pierced the billows of dirty smoke.\n\nIt was a suicide bomber. Body parts were flung over a 50-yard radius, scraps of gore spattered all over the courtyard. On the exterior wall, exactly opposite where M\u00f8rck had been crouching, a violent starburst of blood and carbon was painted. The ceramic tiles on the patio were shattered, as if a cannonball had fallen there. But the wall had held, thwarting the bomber and saving M\u00f8rck's life.\n\nThroughout the winter, foreign volunteers have been dying at an alarming rate: an Englishman and a Canadian in December; and in January, at least two Americans, including Paolo Todd, a 33-year-old from Los Angeles I'd met at the Academy. When I last spoke to Belden and Chapman, they complained of boredom, but M\u00f8rck was still in the thick of it; he sent an e-mail describing a firefight with ISIS in which half the men of his unit were wounded, two of them mortally. \"I was surprised by my reaction,\" he wrote, \"watching a person I knew die and shooting at another human being, with the intent to kill, not out of anger or desperation, but out of necessity. I've been wondering whether or not I really had it in me. Now I know for certain that I do.\"\n\n\n\nI also got an e-mail from Franceschi, who had formed a stand-alone unit of foreign leftists modeled on the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War. It's called the Antifascist International Tabur, and its central mission is to fight in Raqqa, a battle that he says will last through 2017 and be \"a hundred times worse than Kobani and Manbij put together.\" More volunteers are needed, Franceschi says, and all of them will be trained by YPG. Recruits must meet only one prerequisite: \"If they want to join us, they must have an ideal that is not just killing or destroying. They can be anarchists, socialists, leftists, whatever. But they must feel like this revolution is their revolution. Because these are ideals that people are dying for.\""}, "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Colin-Kaepernick-Donates-50000-to-Standing-Rock-Health-Clinic-20170108-0014.html": {"title": "Colin Kaepernick Donates $50,000 to Standing Rock Health Clinic", "keywords": ["United States", " Social movements", " Indigenous rights", " Anti-racism", " Environmental disaster"], "url": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Colin-Kaepernick-Donates-50000-to-Standing-Rock-Health-Clinic-20170108-0014.html", "text": ""}, "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/10/us/native-lives-matter/index.html": {"title": "The forgotten minority in police shootings", "keywords": ["us", " Native Americans: The forgotten minority in police shootings - CNN"], "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/10/us/native-lives-matter/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Allegations of excessive police use of force against African-Americans have captured the nation's attention in recent years. But there's another group whose stories you're less likely to hear about.\n\nNative Americans are killed in police encounters at a higher rate than any other racial or ethnic group, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet rarely do these deaths gain the national spotlight.\n\nThis lack of attention has prompted some advocates to start social media campaigns reminiscent of Black Lives Matter.\n\n\"Native American people are basically invisible to most of the people in the country,\" said Daniel Sheehan, general counsel for the Lakota People's Law Project\n\nFor every 1 million Native Americans, an average of 2.9 of them died annually from 1999 to 2015 as a result of a \"legal intervention,\" according to a CNN review of CDC data broken down by race. The vast majority of these deaths were police shootings. But a few were attributed to other causes, including manhandling. That mortality rate is 12% higher than for African-Americans and three times the rate of whites.\n\n\"(There is) no reason you can justify shooting a 14-year-old boy,\" Pero's mother, Holly Gauthier, told WDIO-TV.\n\nPaul Castaway's death in the summer of 2015 was one of those controversial shootings that moved his family to fight for wider attention to police violence against Native Americans.\n\nA district attorney's report gave the following account of Castaway's death:\n\nCastaway had entered her home without her permission and poked her in the neck with a kitchen knife before running out the back door.\n\nWhen police arrived, they chased Castaway, who demanded that police kill him and then pressed the knife to his own throat.\n\nVideo surveillance footage appears to show Castaway was still holding the knife to his throat with both hands as he walked toward one of the officers.\n\nThat officer backed away and fired his gun three times, hitting Castaway twice in the torso. Castaway fell to the ground, and police handcuffed him. He died at the hospital, according to The Denver Post.\n\nCastaway's brother, Gabriel Black Elk, said it took him almost a year to watch the video. \"There was a lot of mental anguish we had to go through, me and my mom and my sister.\"\n\n\"Police knew they were there to help,\" Black Elk said. \"He wasn't a danger to anybody but himself.\"\n\nSpurred to action by his brother's death, Black Elk, a member of the Lakota Sioux tribe, created a Facebook message group for Native American families who have lost loved ones to police encounters. Slowly, the group expanded to include families of all races.\n\n\"A lot of people told me, 'I didn't know this was a problem for Native Americans, too,' \" he said.\n\n\"The numbers might be wildly underreported,\" he said.\n\nIn 1996, American Indian mortality rates were underreported by an estimated 21% because of inconsistencies in identifying Native Americans on death certificates, according to the CDC. The problem has lingered in recent years and is significant enough to make comparisons with other racial groups tricky.\n\nThe numbers in the Fatal Encounters database, for instance, are more than twice the average number of Native American deaths by legal intervention reported to the CDC.\n\nAs Black Elk started to create his Facebook group for grieving families, he said he was just as likely to learn about another Native American death through the grapevine as through local or national media.\n\nMarlee Kanosh, too, lost a brother to police gunfire back in 2012. Corey Kanosh was the passenger in a police chase involving a drunken driver. When the car stopped, he fled police on foot and was shot while resisting arrest. The county attorney concluded that forensic evidence and dispatch logs supported the officer's account of events, but his family complains that he was left overnight at the scene without medical care.\n\n\"There are very few people who've heard about a story somewhere out in a small reservation in California, and I see a lot of families who deal with that,\" she said.\n\nHis brother's death was not the only link Black Elk had to police shootings. His mother's nephew, Benjamin Whiteshield, was killed by police in Oklahoma in 2012. According to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, his family had brought him to the local police station because he had been \"acting delusional.\" Police said he was holding a wrench and was shot in the mouth after a confrontation with an officer.\n\nThen Black Elk's cousin, Raymond Gassman, was killed in South Dakota less than a year after his brother died. He was shot by tribal police while resisting arrest.\n\nAnd in June, a member of Black Elk's tribe, Zachary Bearheels, died after a violent encounter with police.\n\nOn June 4, Bearheels, 29, was on his way home to Oklahoma when he got kicked off a bus in Omaha, Nebraska. When he failed to make it home, his mother, Renita Chalepah, called police to let them know her son was lost and suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, the police investigation found.\n\nOmaha police found Bearheels shortly after midnight at a convenience store. The department reported that officers put him on the phone with Chalepah.\n\nAccording to the police investigation, officers agreed to take Bearheels to the bus station. They handcuffed him and put him in the back of a police cruiser, but he slipped out of the car. That led to a scuffle. Police video shows officers shock Bearheels repeatedly with a Taser, drag him by his belt and ponytail, and punch him in the head.\n\nHe was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Two former officers are now facing assault charges. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe police department's investigation found the officers' use of the Taser an \"egregious violation\" of policy.\n\n\"Zachary Bearheels committed no crime,\" Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine said at a press conference. \"Zachary Bearheels was simply a human being suffering from a severe mental illness that was quite obvious to anyone who came in contact with him. Our laws should protect those who are most vulnerable, particularly those who suffer from mental illness.\"\n\nBlack Elk sees the deaths of his brother and Bearheels as part of a larger problem facing Native Americans.\n\n\"It has to do with a mental health crisis and with police killing Native Americans,\" he said.\n\nSome legal experts with experience working with Native American communities agree that mental health has played a role in the high rate of deaths from police encounters. They say that mental health services for Native Americans are often woefully inadequate.\n\nThe report found the agency was ineffective, lacked adequate oversight and put Native Americans' health and safety at risk.\n\n\"(Native Americans) do not have anything even approaching reasonable mental health services,\" Sheehan of the Lakota People's Law Project said of on-reservation health care. \"It's staggering.\"\n\nAddressing the GAO's report, Chris Buchanan, acting director of the Indian Health Service, told the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in May, \"We share the urgency of addressing longstanding systemic problems... We are using the GAO findings and recommendations to inform our strategic and tactical planning efforts.\"\n\nSome experts also said they believe that pervasive stereotypes about Native Americans may help contribute to highly charged police encounters.\n\nNative Americans are often stereotyped as being violent or addicted to alcohol and other drugs, said Fletcher of Michigan State University. He suspects those perceptions, conscious or not, can sometimes tinge police-civilian interactions.\n\n\"If your perception going into a situation is that it's an Indian person and they're completely out of control, I think that changes things on the ground,\" he said.\n\nKanosh recalls growing up and seeing \"older people get in these scary interactions with police because of alcohol.\"\n\n\"And that would set the bar for future years for cops to always assume that when they were dealing with Native Americans it's going to be because they're drunk and going to get in fights,\" she said.\n\nA consultant for law enforcement agreed that cultural barriers are a challenge for police in dealing with Native Americans.\n\nScism said he believes those split-second decisions usually fall within the boundaries of the law.\n\n\"I'm not going to say the police always get it right; they're human just like everybody else,\" he said.\n\nTsingine was in sweatpants on Easter Sunday last year when officers stopped her in a parking lot on suspicion of shoplifting from a convenience store. Silent body camera footage captures a brief struggle in which Tsingine appears to fall, pulls out a pair of scissors, and then moves away.\n\nShe then turns back toward one of the officers, with the scissors in her hand pointed down. The officer shoots her four times: twice in the front and twice in the back as she crumples to the ground, according to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.\n\nThe Department of Justice was called in to examine the police investigation of the case.

He said Europe and the world are \u201cwatching us\u201d and \u201cwaiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places\u201d.\n\nHe promised to unite a divided and fractured France, saying: \u201cI will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago, he said: \u201cEveryone said it was impossible. But they didn\u2019t know France!\u201d\n\nDespite the wide margin of the final result, Le Pen\u2019s score nonetheless marked a historic high for the French far right. Even after a lacklustre campaign that ended with a calamitous performance in the final TV debate, she was projected to have taken almost 11m votes, double that of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, when he reached the presidential run-off in 2002. The anti-immigration, anti-EU Front National\u2019s supporters asserted that the party had a central place as an opposition force in France.\n\nTurnout was the lowest in more than 40 years. Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen, with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers.\n\nMacron, who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago, is France\u2019s youngest president. Next Sunday, he will take over a country under a state of emergency, still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment. France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war.\n\n\n\nFran\u00e7ois Bayrou, an ex-minister and Macron\u2019s centrist ally, said: \u201cHe is the youngest head of state on the planet [which] sends an incredible message of hope. Macron is giving hope to people who had no hope. Hope that maybe we can do something, go beyond the [left-right] divide that no longer makes sense.\u201d\n\nLe Pen swiftly conceded defeat. She said she had won a \u201chistoric and massive\u201d score that made her leader of \u201cthe biggest opposition force\u201d in France and vowed to radically overhaul her Front National party. Her promise to \u201ctransform\u201d the far-right movement left open the possibility that the party could be expanded and renamed in an attempt to boost its electoral chances. It was a major step in the political normalisation of her movement.\n\nThe outgoing Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who was once Macron\u2019s mentor and had appointed him economy minister, said: \u201cHis large victory confirms that a very great majority of our citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union and show France is open to the world.\u201d\n\nOn Monday Hollande embraced his successor as the two men attended a ceremony at Paris\u2019s Arc de Triomphe to commemorate victory over the Nazis in the second world war. Hollande walked beside Macron to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the monument, where they laid a wreath.\n\nMacron\u2019s victory came not only because voters supported his policy platform for free market, pro-business reform, and his promises to energise the EU, coupled with a leftwing approach to social issues. Some of his voters came from other parties across the political spectrum and turned out not in complete support of his programme but to stop the Front National.\n\nIn a political landscape with a strong hard left and far right, Macron faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! (On the Move!) in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises.\n\nAfter the Brexit vote and the election of Trump as US president, the race for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e was the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo, ejecting the mainstream parties that have dominated French politics for 50 years and leaving the political novice Macron to do battle with the far right.\n\nHis victory comes after a bitter campaign with Le Pen in which she accused him of being part of an elite that did not understand ordinary people and he said Le Pen represented the \u201cparty of hatred\u201d that wanted a \u201ccivil war\u201d in France. The runoff pitted France\u2019s most Europhile candidate against its most Europhobe.\n\n\n\nIn Brussels and Berlin, there was relief that Le Pen\u2019s anti-EU, anti-globalisation programme was defeated.\n\nA spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said it was a \u201cvictory for a strong and united Europe\u201d while the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said French voters had chosen a \u201cEuropean future\u201d.\n\nThe office of the British prime minister, Theresa May, said she \u201cwarmly congratulates\u201d Macron on his victory and \u201cwe look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities\u201d.\n\nTrump, who will meet Macron on 25 May at the Nato summit in Brussels, tweeted: \u201cCongratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next president of France. I look very much forward to working with him!\u201d Earlier in the campaign, he had declared Le Pen the strongest candidate.\n\nIn a congratulatory statement, the Kremlin, which was widely seen as backing Le Pen, urged Macron to overcome mutual distrust and join forces to ensure international stability and security.\n\nHours before the end of campaigning on Friday night, Macron\u2019s campaign was hacked, which Paris prosecutors are investigating. Hundreds of thousands of emails and documents were dumped online and spread by WikiLeaks in what his campaign called an attempt at \u201cdemocratic destabilisation\u201d.\n\n\n\nMacron, a former investment banker and senior civil servant who grew up in a bourgeois family in Amiens, served as deputy chief of staff to Hollande but was not part of the Socialist party.\n\nIn 2014, Hollande appointed him economy minister but he left government in 2016, complaining that pro-business reforms were not going far enough. A year ago he formed En Marche!, promising to shake up France\u2019s \u201cvacuous\u201d and discredited political class.\n\n\n\nMacron campaigned on pledges to ease labour laws, improve education in deprived areas and extend protections for self-employed people.\n\n\n\nThe election race was full of extraordinary twists and turns. Hollande became the first president since the war to decide not to run again for office after slumping to record unpopularity with a satisfaction rating of 4%.\n\nHis troubled five-year term left France still struggling with a sluggish economy and a mood of disillusionment with the political class. The country is more divided than ever before. More than 230 people have been killed in terrorist attacks in little more than two years, the political class is questioning Islam\u2019s place in French society and more than three million people are unemployed.\n\n\n\nThe rightwing candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, once seen as favourite, was badly damaged by a judicial investigation into a string of corruption allegations, including that he paid his wife and children generous salaries from public funds for fake parliamentary assistant jobs.\n\nThe ruling Socialist party, under its candidate Beno\u00eet Hamon, saw its score plunge to 6%, while the hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon finished fourth.\n\nThe final round marks a redrawing of the political landscape, away from the old left-right divide towards a contest between a liberal, pro-globalisation stance and \u201cclose the borders\u201d nationalism. Le Pen has styled the election as being between her party\u2019s \u201cpatriots\u201d and the \u201cglobalists\u201d whom she says Macron represents."}, "https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/race-and-criminal-justice/jeff-sessions-takes-stand-debtors-prisons": {"title": "Jeff Sessions Takes a Stand for Debtors\u2019 Prisons", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/race-and-criminal-justice/jeff-sessions-takes-stand-debtors-prisons", "text": ""}, "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41780116": {"title": "Catalan independence crisis escalates", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41780116", "text": "The Catalan regional parliament has voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return \"law, democracy and stability\" to Catalonia.\n\nThe crisis began earlier this month when Catalonia held a controversial referendum on independence.\n\nThe Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence.

One year later, researchers are still trying to better understand the delicate relationship between police and the communities they patrol.\n\nNow, instead of focusing on police use of force, some researchers are turning their attention to use of language.\n\nA new study suggests that police officers in Oakland, California, are more likely to speak to white community members with a higher level of respect than black community members. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, used police body camera footage as data.\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether this racial disparity in language occurs in other communities across the United States, but Rob Voigt, lead author of the study, said it's worth investigating.\n\n\"At the very least, this provides evidence for something that communities of color have reported, that this is a real phenomenon,\" said Voigt, a doctoral student in the linguistics department at Stanford University.\n\nVoigt added that he and his colleagues were grateful to the Oakland Police Department for allowing them to study the department's body camera footage.\n\nThe study involved 183 hours of body camera footage taken during 981 routine traffic stops by 245 different Oakland Police Department officers in April 2014. The footage of the officers' interactions with community members was transcribed.\n\nThe researchers then randomly selected 312 utterances spoken to black community members and 102 spoken to white community members for volunteers to analyze.\n\nThe researchers asked the volunteers to read the transcript of one community member's utterance and then the utterance by the police officer that followed in response. The volunteers rated on a four-point scale how respectful, polite, friendly, formal and impartial the officer was.\n\nEach interaction was rated by at least 10 volunteers, who did not know the names or races of the officers or the community members or any other contextual or identifying information.\n\nNext, the researchers developed a computer model to rate how respectful each interaction was based on pre-existing scientific literature about respectfulness and politeness.\n\nFor instance, the computer measured how often police officers introduced themselves; used formal titles such as ma'am or sir; used words like please and thank you; apologized, such as saying \"sorry to stop you\"; and reassured safety, such as saying \"drive safe, please\" -- all of which are utterances that show signs of respect, according to the study.\n\nFor example, the transcripts in the study included these sentences: \"Sorry to stop you. My name's Officer (name) with the Police Department.\" \"There you go, ma'am. Drive safe, please.\"\n\nLess respectful utterances included using informal titles like \"man\" or first names, or asking for agency, such as saying \"do me a favor.\"\n\nThe transcripts in the study included these sentences: \"All right, my man. Do me a favor. Just keep your hands on the steering wheel real quick.\" \"(First name] can I see that driver's license again?\"\n\nThe researchers used the computer model to automatically estimate the level of respect for every utterance and to estimate how respectful a human might have rated each utterance.\n\nAfter analyzing all of their data, the researchers found that white community members were 57% more likely to hear an officer say one of the most respectful utterances in the dataset, such as apologizing. Black community members were 61% more likely to hear an officer say one of the least respectful utterances, such as informal titles.\n\nThe racial disparity occurred despite the police officers' race and among most officers, not outliers, the researchers found. The disparity emerged at the early onset of interactions and was still present after controlling for whether a community member was arrested, given a citation or searched, Voigt said.\n\n'This is our effort to build trust,' deputy chief says\n\n\"From our perspective, we appreciate the fact that we are able to participate in this study where we were actually able to assess our officers' interactions and their communications and see ways in which we can improve,\" Oakland Police Department Deputy Chief Leronne Armstrong said Tuesday.\n\n\"The data that they were using was from 2014,\" he said of the study. \"Since that time, we've implemented lots of training internally, both for our sworn officers as well as our professional staff.\"\n\n\"We want our officers to understand that these things, according to the research, matter to people and that they help officers build trust with community members,\" Armstrong said.\n\n\"We hope that departments throughout the country will understand the importance of taking an internal look at themselves,\" he said. \"It's not a bad thing to learn. It is not a bad thing to improve, and it is vital when you're trying to build trust. This is our effort to build trust and just be the best we can be for the city of Oakland.\"\n\nThe study \"is self-limiting in the sense that they focused only on transcriptions of verbal utterances in traffic stops, but I think this is a wise first step,\" said Jack Glaser, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"I am aware of community surveys that have been conducted, and they certainly indicate that black people feel treated more poorly by police, but this is the first analysis of body-worn camera data that I'm aware of,\" he said. \"It contributes a lot to our understanding of racial disparities in police-civilian encounters.\"\n\nGlaser added that interactions in which a community member might feel disrespected not only can be stressful but can lead to behavioral and health effects and even acute trauma for that community member.\n\nJohn Dovidio, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, agreed.\n\n'How can you change the training?'\n\n\"If any of us feel that we've been disrespected in the situation, it's psychologically wounding to us,\" said Dovidio, who was also not involved in the new study.\n\nHe added, however, that respect appears to be a particularly deep-rooted need for communities that historically have been disadvantaged.\n\n\"If you bring a majority and a minority group member together, a white and a black person, in those interactions, the basic needs and goals of the white and black person are very different,\" Dovidio said.\n\n\"The white person in these intergroup interactions tends to want to be liked. They want to be sort of affirmed as being a good person,\" he said. \"But people of color, and this occurs for other historically disadvantaged groups, their major goal is to be respected. ... Everybody wants respect, but minority group members in interracial interactions with authority figures have a particularly heightened need to feel respected in those interactions, and that's why respect is such a key variable.\"\n\nThe first step to improving everyday interactions between police and the communities they serve is awareness, which the new study provides, Dovidio said.\n\n\"What this does is, makes it real, makes it tangible, makes it objective,\" he said. \"It can then be used not to blame people ... but what it can be used for is a tool for teaching people how to not do something that they may be doing unintentionally.\"\n\nIn other words, police and other people of authority tend to unconsciously or implicitly display this disrespect through language, Dovidio said.\n\n\"The outcome of this disrespect is actually, it's a lose-lose situation, because law-abiding people in a community don't want crime. Police don't want crime. But the actions of the police officers undermine the trust and connection of them with the community,\" Dovidio said.\n\n\"Rather than blame police officers, I think the question is, how can you change the training and the experiences that police officers have?\" he said. \"I would hope that this article is not interpreted as a way of saying police officers are bad, but rather, here's some ideas of how police training can be improved and police practice can be improved to get the trust of the community, to create a relationship that's healthy and cooperative.\""}, "http://www.rawstory.com/2016/09/man-dies-of-thirst-in-jail-run-by-trump-loving-sheriff-after-guards-cut-off-his-water-for-six-days/": {"title": "Man dies of thirst in jail run by Trump-loving sheriff after guards cut off his water for six days", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.rawstory.com/2016/09/man-dies-of-thirst-in-jail-run-by-trump-loving-sheriff-after-guards-cut-off-his-water-for-six-days/", "text": "Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke speaks at the National Rifle Association national convention on April 9, 2015.

Another protester threw hot coffee inside the bus on the bus driver. Click below to watch a video with clips showing the violence and intolerance we experienced in Boston (WARNING: language).\n\nThe next day, the bus visited New Haven, Connecticut. Towards the end of the day, one of our representatives got out of the bus to take photos. When he wasn't looking, he was attacked from behind and punched repeatedly by a protester.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the mayor's \u201cOffice of LGBT Affairs\u201d proudly referred to themselves as \u201can accomplice\u201d in organizing protests against the bus. These protests quickly turned violent, with gay activists and anarchists attacking the bus and the police officers who were trying to maintain order. At least one of the protestors was arrested, and bus organizers were prevented from speaking freely to the press. The Mayor\u2019s office took pride in this act of intolerant bullying.\n\nThe same individuals and groups who want to fly the flag of tolerance and acceptance are far from tolerant when it comes to dissenting views.\n\nThis is their response when someone says something so commonsensical as: boys are boys and girls are girls. All we ask for is respect for our views and the opportunity to voice them in accordance with the First Amendment.\n\nThe attacks on the #FreeSpeechBus show that intolerance and hatred against those who disagree with gender ideology dogmas is increasing in the United States and worldwide. As a consequence, the fight for liberty, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech is more urgent than ever.\n\nOur #FreeSpeechBus was just attacked and vandalized right in front of the United Nations in New York City. Our bus driver received minor injuries during the incident. Police will pull video from nearby surveillance. This is a hate crime, and sadly the way that those who pretend to preach \"tolerance\" feel about opposing viewpoints.\n\nThere will be some major costs to get the bus back on the road in a timely manner. We are liable for the bus and safety of the bus driver. Please help us get the bus back on the road by the road this weekend with a small donation of $10, $15, or $20.\n\nTo donate please go to https://donate.citizengo.org/en/.\n\nNews stories (as you can imagine, most of them are from a very leftist perspective):\n\nUpdate March 22, 2017: The #FreeSpeechBus is rolling through Manhattan today, with stops at Times Square, Trump Tower, the United Nations, and the Stonewall Inn. We are sharing a message of free speech, and the right of parents to refuse the indoctrination of gender ideology in schools!\n\nThis week CitizenGO is launching the #FreeSpeechBus in the United States!\n\nIf you agree with the biological reality that boys are boys and girls are girls, please sign this petition to support the #FreeSpeechBus.\n\nHere's what the bus will look like... We'll update this petition page with photos of the bus when it launches on Wednesday!\n\nThe bus will be making stops in New York City, New Haven, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington. We hope to extend this campaign to more cities in the future.\n\nAs the bus tours each city, we will host local rallies and press conferences.\n\nWe've already experienced a massive backlash after a similar bus was launched a few weeks ago by our sister organization in Spain, HazteOir.\n\nOur website was even shut down for about 24 hours after we experienced a Denial of Service attack from an extreme pro-LGBT hacker group. These hackers attacked us because they are furious that CitizenGO (and our Spanish counterpart, HazteOir) would dare speak common sense about the biological reality that boys are boys and girls are girls. According to the Spanish police, this attack was orchestrated by the well-known hacker group \u201cAnonymous.\u201d The #FreeSpeechBus campaign was originally formulated in response to a pamphlet that was distributed by the pro-transgender organization CHRYSALLIS. The pamphlet shows four naked children holding hands, including a \u201cboy\u201d with female genitalia and a \u201cgirl\u201d with male genitalia. Under the drawing of the children is the slogan: \"There are girls with penises and boys with vaginas. It's that simple.\u201d Simple?! I hope you can agree with me that this statement is a denial of biological reality! It is far from \u201csimple.\u201d The pamphlet campaign was funded by an unknown businessman from New York. A spokeswoman for CHRYSALLIS said that the posters were designed to \"raise awareness about transgender children.\u201d In response to this pamphlet, CitizenGO launched an informational campaign, which includes the buses, to warn against this gender indoctrination. We don't know what the response to the #FreeSpeechBus will be in the US, but we expect that radical gender ideologues may try to get our bus shut down. Please sign this petition to show your support for the #FreeSpeechBus. Whatever happens over the next few days, we will not give into the pressure to stop this important campaign. We will continue fighting for our values around the globe. We will keep you updated on this webpage and via email as the situation continues to unfold during the bus launch in the United States. Thank you for signing this petition and sharing it with your friends.

But it's not because the game trivializes the horrors of World War II or because it grossly celebrates violence. As far as I can tell, they are mad because the \"politically correct\" game degrades Nazis and is \"anti-white.\"\n\nHere are just a few examples from 4Chan, Reddit, and YouTube comments on the game's trailer:\n\nWolfenstein: The Colossus is the sequel to 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order, which is itself a reimagining of 1992's Wolfenstein 3D, an early first-person shooter that largely defined the genre. There is nothing in The Colossus that is all that different than the previous game or the original. It is set in an alternate history where the Nazis won World War II and occupy the United States. As William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, players will form a resistance and kill many Nazis in a gory, disgusting fashion.\n\nSo why is this game offending the alt-right? One reason, it seems, is that there is a shot in the trailer in which two KKK members, dressed in white hoods and all, are seen palling around with a Nazi officer. I've seen several comments that take offense at the suggested comparison. As in: They don't think what the Nazis tried to achieve and what the KKK believes in are the same, though at the same time these commenters weren't speaking ill of Nazis either.\n\nAnother reason is that the trailer features two characters that rubbed the alt-right the wrong way: An African-American woman who appears to be some kind of rebel leader in the anti-Nazi insurgency, and a white man from the South who references the \"proletariat\" and rants against Wall Street and imperialism. The former, they say, is racist to white people, and the latter is a communist, which is even worse than being a Nazi.\n\nLastly, the reality of 2017 is that internet culture and gaming culture in particular is at a place where people will openly defend Nazis. As author of The Ambivalent Internet Whitney Phillips has written for Motherboard, it's hard if not impossible to parse out which of these online comments are sincerely and ideologically in support of Nazis, and which are just saying these things in order to agitate. But it also doesn't matter because the effect is the same: A loud and unapologetic contingent of people online are saying that it's unfair to paint Nazis as villains."}, "http://rt.com/usa/monsanto-bill-blunt-agriculture-006/": {"title": "Obama signs 'Monsanto Protection Act' written by Monsanto-sponsored senator", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://rt.com/usa/monsanto-bill-blunt-agriculture-006/", "text": "United States President Barack Obama has signed a bill into law that was written in part by the very billion-dollar corporation that will benefit directly from the legislation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pres. Obama inked his name to H.R. 933, a continuing resolution spending bill approved in Congress days earlier. Buried 78 pages within the bill exists a provision that grossly protects biotech corporations such as the Missouri-based Monsanto Company from litigation.\n\nWith the president\u2019s signature, agriculture giants that deal with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and genetically engineered (GE) seeds are given the go-ahead to continue to plant and sell man-made crops, even as questions remain largely unanswered about the health risks these types of products pose to consumers.\n\nIn light of approval from the House and Senate, more than 250,000 people signed a petition asking the president to veto the spending bill over the biotech rider tacked on, an item that has since been widely referred to as the \u201cMonsanto Protection Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Obama ignored [the petition],\u201dIB Times\u2019 Connor Sheets writes, \u201cinstead choosing to sign a bill that effectively bars federal courts from being able to halt the sale or planting of GMO or GE crops and seeds, no matter what health consequences from the consumption of these products may come to light in the future.\u201d\n\nJames Brumley, a reporter for Investor Place, explains a little more thoroughly just how dangerous the rider is now that biotech companies are allowed to bypass judicial scrutiny. Up until it was signed, he writes, \u201cthe USDA [US Department of Agriculture] oversaw and approved (or denied) the testing of genetically modified seeds, while the federal courts retained the authority to halt the testing or sale of these plants if it felt that public health was being jeopardized. With HR 933 now a law, however, the court system no longer has the right to step in and protect the consumer.\u201d\n\nIf the president\u2019s signature isn\u2019t all that surprising, though, consider the genesis of the bill itself. According to an article published Monday in the New York Daily News, US Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Missouri) \u201cworked with Monsanto to craft the language in the bill.\u201d\n\nSen. Blunt defended his bill to the News, shrugging off suggestions that it set a startling precedent that will affect all US agriculture by firing back, \u201cWhat it says is if you plant a crop that is legal to plant when you plant it, you get to harvest it. But it is only a one-year protection in that bill.\u201d\n\nOne year could be all it takes to cause catastrophic damage to the environment by allowing laboratory-produced organisms to be planted into the earth without oversight. Under the Monsanto Protection Act, health concerns that arise in the immediate future involving the planting of GMO crops won\u2019t be able to be heard by a judge. Blunt, a junior senator that has held elected office since the late \u201890s, has good reason to whitewash the very bill he helped craft. The Center for Responsive Politics notes that Sen. Blunt received $64,250 from Monsanto to go towards his campaign committee between 2008 and 2012. The Money Monocle website adds that Blunt has been the largest Republican Party recipient of Monsanto funding as of late.\n\nOn the lawmaker\u2019s official website, a statement explains a little more as to why he favored HR 933 and the rider within it.\n\n\u201cAs the Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, Senator Blunt played a vital role in writing the fiscal year 2013 Agriculture Appropriations bill. This legislation maintained vital support for research and extension at land grant universities, capacity building grants for non-land grant colleges of agriculture, and competitive funding under the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). The bill also included funding for conservation activities, housing and business loan programs for rural communities, domestic and international nutrition programs.\u201d\n\nNowhere does the senator\u2019s site mention the Monsanto Protection Act by name, although it claims Blunt \u201csupports continued investments in agricultural research and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Blunt not realize that Monsanto would stand to gain significantly if section 735 survived and HR 933 was signed into law?\u201d asks Brumley. \u201cNot likely,\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way of getting around the fact this is an abusive conflict of interest,\u201d he says.\n\nClearly isn\u2019t Brumley the only one that feels that way either: Blunt\u2019s Wikipedia page was vandalized this week to read in the first paragraph, \u201cHis Senate seat was previously held by Republican Kit Bond, until Bond's retirement, and will be sold by Blunt to Monsanto Corporation upon his retirement.\u201d"}, "http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2017/02/01/allen-scarsella-black-lives-matter-protesters-shootings/": {"title": "Scarsella Guilty In Shooting Of Black Lives Matter Protesters", "keywords": ["vibNews"], "url": "http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2017/02/01/allen-scarsella-black-lives-matter-protesters-shootings/", "text": "MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) \u2013 The man accused in the November 2015 shooting of five Black Lives Matter protesters was found guilty of all charges by a Hennepin County jury on Wednesday.\n\nAllen Scarsella was one of four men arrested in the incident following the officer-involved shooting of Jamar Clark, which prompted protests from the group Black Lives Matter outside the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s Fourth Precinct for weeks. Scarsella had been charged with 12 felony counts in the incident, ranging from assault to rioting.\n\nProsecutors argued that the shootings of the Black Lives Matter protesters were racially-motivated. Scarsella was identified in a video taken the night of the shootings waiving a handgun and making racially-charged statements about the protesters. The video ends with one of the men involved in the incident saying, \u201cStay white.\u201d\n\nScarsella admitted to shooting the five protesters to a friend, an officer with the Mankato Police Department. Scarsella took the stand last week in his own defense, claiming he was acting in self-defense.\n\n\u201cMan I had butterflies.

Things came out the way I wanted them to come out,\u201d shooting victim Cameron Clark said. \u201cBut the fight is still not over with.\u201d\n\nScarsella claims his group was punched and had their lives threatened. Scarsella said he saw a protester holding a shining object in a threatening gesture, thought it was a knife, took out his gun and started firing.\n\n\u201cI was shot on my right leg and my left foot. The bullet missed artery by half an inch,\u201d said Clark.\n\nHennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said, \u201cThe jury believed the charges we made were supported by the evidence we presented the jury, and they found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That to me is a huge victory.\u201d\n\nThat evidence included a video that was shot in a car while Scarsella and a friend were driving to an earlier protest. In the video, Scarsella is heard saying he is \u201con a mission\u201d and \u201clocked and loaded\u201d while holding a gun.\n\nOne of the text messages he wrote stated that he had gun designed to kill black people. Clark felt the evidence was crucial in reaching a guilty verdict.\n\n\u201cThe video, the text messages, [Scarsella] texting the officer and how he saying that he wanted to shoot black people and he really came down there and shot us and he really did his job,\u201d Clark said. \u201cHe went down there, provoked, saying racial slurs. He lured us up the street and that\u2019s when he fired shots at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Scarsella\u2019s conduct was truly outrageous,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cRacist language, his conduct is simply not acceptable.\u201d\n\nScarsella will be sentenced March 10. Freeman said he could up to 230 months in prison, or about 19 years. Freeman doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019ll get that amount but plans to ask for it.\n\nThe three other men involved in the incident, Joseph Backman, Nathan Gustavsson and Daniel Macey all face felony charges of second-degree riot with a dangerous weapon."}, "http://m.en.canoe.com/CNEWS/Canada/2017/06/04/22728793.html": {"title": "Canada 150 proved to be a big draw for tourism coast to coast", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://m.en.canoe.com/CNEWS/Canada/2017/06/04/22728793.html", "text": "FREDERICTON \u2014 Canada celebrated its 150th birthday in 2017 but it was the tourism industry that got to collect the presents.\n\nTourism operators from coast to coast were planning for big events and extra visitors, and in many cases the numbers have exceeded expectations even before the year draws to a close.\n\n\u201cDouble digit increases in every part of the country,\u201d said Gary Howard of the Canadian Automobile Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just international travellers, primarily it was a lot of Canadians who wanted to see more of their country that they hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\nDestination Canada, a federal Crown corporation, ran a campaign aimed at millennials in an effort to instil a \u201csense of pride\u201d in the country and have them become lifetime ambassadors for Canada both at home and abroad.

In the wake of the FCC\u2019s decision to roll back net neutrality rules , it started getting dozens of requests a day.\n\nWithout net neutrality protections, big telecom companies can choose to slow down or block certain sites. If you want to watch Netflix, for example, Comcast could decide to charge you more to access it. A community-run \u201cmesh\u201d network, by contrast, takes back control from corporations: Everyone on the network can agree to keep all content open. When a system is fully running, the people who use it can cancel their contract with a traditional internet service provider and stop paying any monthly bills.\n\nIn Manhattan, NYC Mesh put a large antenna on top of a building connected directly to the internet through fiber optic cable. This \u201csupernode,\u201d supported by a network of point-to-point routers that volunteers install on rooftops and windows in the area, provides a fast connection for users in most of downtown. A second supernode is in place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick, and two more are planned.\n\n\u201cI think with around 30 or 40 supernodes we could cover the whole city,\u201d says Brian Hall, a volunteer working on the project. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us a while, but that\u2019s our plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something of a return to how the internet originally worked. \u201cOne thing that inspires me is that the original idea of the internet was a network of networks,\u201d Hall says. \u201cDifferent organizations like universities or the Defense Department would form their own network, and then they would join them together, and that is how the internet formed. We\u2019re just getting back to the idea. We formed a network, and we join our network with other networks, and get rid of the ISP layer that we don\u2019t really need.\u201d\n\nBuilding this type of network can be challenging, and the existing efforts in the U.S. are small. Some projects, like a network attempted in Hoboken, New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy, never took off. In many cases, it\u2019s difficult to get access to the best locations for supernodes. \u201cThe people who own masts up on hills or who own tall buildings have become accustomed to the fact that they can charge large monthly rental costs to big ISPs,\u201d says Marc Juul, one of the co-creators of the People\u2019s Open Network, a Bay Area-based mesh network in the early stages in Oakland.\n\nUnlike big telecom companies, which rely solely on a small number of these expensive relay points, a mesh network can route internet from house to house. Having a dense network of participants can keep the bandwidth high and makes the network resilient. But building a comprehensive network is also difficult. \u201cOne of the problems in starting a mesh network is bootstrapping\u2013how you get a mesh network from nothing to actually existing,\u201d says Juul. \u201cEvery time someone comes and wants to be on the mesh, in the beginning, they\u2019re very likely going to be very far away from anyone else on the mesh.\u201d"}, "https://news.sky.com/story/police-officer-who-shot-dead-dad-as-he-crawled-and-begged-for-his-life-cleared-of-murder-11162558": {"title": "Police officer who shot dead dad as he crawled and begged for his life cleared of murder", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/police-officer-who-shot-dead-dad-as-he-crawled-and-begged-for-his-life-cleared-of-murder-11162558", "text": ""}, "https://m.mic.com/articles/176143/wealthy-man-beats-down-asian-victim-in-new-york-city-while-shouting-we-are-white-power#.O1wjNK57w": {"title": "White man beats Asian victim in New York City while shouting \"We are white power\"", "keywords": ["New York City", " New York City Police Department", " Attack!", " Black people", " Race", " White people", " Police", " Crime", " Manhattan", " Steven Zatorski", " Midtown Manhattan", " san diego", " white power", " white nationalism", " white supremacy", " asian", " hate crime.", " new york city", " NYPD", " lexington", " themovement"], "url": "https://m.mic.com/articles/176143/wealthy-man-beats-down-asian-victim-in-new-york-city-while-shouting-we-are-white-power#.O1wjNK57w", "text": "On Monday, the New York Police Department arrested and charged Steven Zatorski \u2014 a 48-year-old white man \u2014 for assaulting an unidentified 30-year-old Asian male in Midtown Manhattan around 10:40 a.m. Eastern.\n\nWhile kicking the victim, Zatorski shouted, \"We are white power,\" a spokesman for the NYPD said in an email.

Bannon hired him as a senior editor in 2014.\n\nBannon, now President Trump\u2019s senior adviser, championed the British-born Yiannopoulos\u2019s inflammatory commentary and promoted him as a conservative truth-teller and champion of free speech. In turn, his popularity helped raise Breitbart\u2019s profile among Trump\u2019s supporters and the alt-right, a vaguely defined collection of nationalists, anti-immigration proponents and anti-establishment conservatives. Adherents of the alt-right are known for espousing racist, anti-Semitic and sexist points of view.\n\n\u201cBreitbart News has stood by me when others caved,\u201d Yiannopoulos said in a statement announcing his resignation. \u201cThey have been a significant factor in my success.\u201d\n\nAs recently as last week, Breitbart editor Alexander Marlow in an interview called Yiannopoulos \u201cthe No. 1 free speech warrior of his generation in America at the moment.\u201d\n\nBut Yiannopoulos\u2019s views on pedophilia apparently went too far even for Breitbart.\n\nThe site was under pressure to take action against Yiannopoulos, 32, from its own staff, which had threatened to revolt if he wasn\u2019t fired or disciplined, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn a video interview early last year, Yiannopoulos condoned sexual relations with boys as young as 13 and joked about a sexual encounter he said he had with a Catholic priest as a teenager.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re misunderstanding what pedophilia means,\u201d he told the hosts of a podcast. \u201cPedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.\u201d\n\nA group called the Reagan Battalion was among those calling attention to the interview to highlight its opposition to Yiannopoulos\u2019s speaking role at the upcoming Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the Washington area.\n\nThe reemergence of the video triggered a cascade of adverse consequences for Yiannopoulos.\n\nFirst, CPAC\u2019s organizer, the American Conservative Union, rescinded its invitation to him as a conference speaker. The group\u2019s chairman said in a statement that the organization found his comments \u201cdisturbing\u201d and the video \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nThen Simon & Schuster canceled an agreement to publish Yiannopoulos\u2019s forthcoming memoir, \u201cDangerous,\u201d for which it paid him a $250,000 advance. The publisher said it decided to cancel the book \u2014 which had drawn protests before the pedophilia flap arose \u2014 \u201cafter careful consideration.\u201d\n\nYiannopoulos, meanwhile, defended himself on Facebook on Sunday and Monday as the tide of controversy rose.\n\n\u201cI do not support pedophilia. Period,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a coordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.\u201d\n\nThe openly gay writer made his name with a knack for taunting various groups and manipulating the outrage that followed. He led a Twitter campaign last year against \u201cGhostbusters\u201d star Leslie Jones that was so vitriolic that Twitter banned him. He has called feminism \u201ccancer\u201d in his campus appearances, and he once wrote a Breitbart story headlined, \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.\u201d\n\nThe departure of Yiannopoulos was met with a mixed reaction by Breitbart\u2019s staff, which learned of his resignation via Twitter. There was no internal announcement, said one staff member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.\n\n\u201cHe was on an island off to himself,\u201d the journalist said. \u201cMilo has virtually nothing to do with the news operation.\u201d\n\nBut Yiannopoulos\u2019s outrageous commentary did reflect poorly on the organization, said Lee Stranahan, a Breitbart reporter who streamed remarks on Periscope in the moments before the star columnist staged a news conference in New York.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish anybody badly, but do I kind of hope Milo goes away?\u201d Stranahan said. \u201cI think I do. I think that would be best for everybody. . . . Because he\u2019s not adding to the brand.\u201d\n\nHe was also critical of the site\u2019s heavy promotion of Yiannopoulos, noting that the writer\u2019s face was often featured prominently on the website.\n\nStranahan asserted that Yiannopoulos\u2019s resignation might allow the site to focus on \u201cthe left and Islamists,\u201d which he described as the \u201cbiggest threat to America.\u201d\n\nAddressing the media in New York on Tuesday, Yiannopoulos was alternately defiant, apologetic and self-pitying. He repeated his denunciation of child sexual abuse and said he would donate 10 percent of the royalties from his book, if it eventually gets published, to organizations that advocate on behalf of abuse victims.\n\nBut he added, \u201cThis is a cynical media witch hunt by people who do not care about children. They care about destroying me.\u201d\n\nHe also said he will continue to speak and write in the same fashion. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anything that has happened to me in the past 24 hours will stop me from being as offensive, provocative and outrageously funny on any subject I please.\u201d"}, "http://www.theonion.com/articles/baltimore-residents-urged-to-stay-indoors-until-so,38511/": {"title": "Baltimore Residents Urged To Stay Indoors Until Social Progress Naturally Takes Its Course Over Next Century", "keywords": ["News", " race", " civil rights", " civil liberties", " News in Brief", " Vol 51 Issue 17", " The Onion"], "url": "http://www.theonion.com/articles/baltimore-residents-urged-to-stay-indoors-until-so,38511/", "text": "BALTIMORE\u2014Calling it an emergency measure designed to ensure public safety and order, Baltimore officials held a press conference Wednesday urging all residents to stay indoors until the natural evolution of social progress takes shape over the next century. \u201cGiven the ongoing situation in our city, we ask that everyone remain within their homes for the next 10 or 12 decades while the various barriers to equality and opportunity for all people are slowly chipped away,\u201d said Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, adding that, in addition to shutting down public schools and the transportation system, the city had canceled work for all nonessential government employees while they wait for the arrival of fully protected civil rights and liberties expected sometime in the 22nd century. \u201cAs we continue to incrementally evolve into a completely free and fair society over the next 100 years, please do not venture outside unless it is absolutely necessary.

Witnesses, however, claim that the volley of bullets came from Ferguson police.\n\nAaten-White was conscious in the ambulance, taking a selfie that went viral. Then in the hospital, doctors debated about whether it was safe to remove the bullet from her skull, which had stopped a bare millimeter from her brain.\n\nWhen Aaten-White woke up from surgery, she repeatedly asked medical personnel when the police were going to come and interview her about the incident. No one came.\n\nWhen she asked who has custody of the key piece of evidence in her case, the bullet, no one could tell her what happened to the slug they pulled from her forehead.\n\n\u201cSomeone has the bullet,\u201d said her attorney Marwan Porter to the Times.\n\nPorter specializes in cases of police misconduct. He said, \u201cWe want to find out who and what agency took possession of the bullet.

No investigative records, such as ballistic records, are subject to disclosure in accordance with Section 610.100 R.S.Mo. The investigative records will be closed records until such time as dictated by Section 610.100 et seq.\u201d\n\nAaten-White says she still has not spoken to the police about the incident, nearly three months later. A detective came to her house once to take a statement, but when she would not speak to him without an attorney present, the detective left and since then, she said, police have been ducking her attorney\u2019s calls.\n\nPart of her reluctance to deal with the department without the benefit of legal counsel, said Aaten-White, is that the incident report about the shooting is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an inaccurate report that we believe, my attorneys believe was produced as a result of the media pressure,\u201d she said, but would not say specifically which sections weren\u2019t true.\n\nRead the Ferguson Police Department\u2019s incident report about the shooting, embedded below:"}, "http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/04/american-democracy-rigged-160424071608730.html": {"title": "American democracy is rigged", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/04/american-democracy-rigged-160424071608730.html", "text": "In the United States presidential elections, there are two towering political parties - the Democratic and the Republican - that during the course of their \"primary\" elections get to choose who will be their respective candidates in the course of a national election.\n\nAlthough any US citizen can join these two parties - or any other political party - millions of eligible voters have not, and consider themselves \"independent\".\n\nThese independent voters get to vote in the general elections like anyone else, but by the time we get to that general election in November, the two dominant political parties have already elected their nominee, and, therefore, US citizens at large have to vote for one of these preselected nominees if they want their vote to have a role in who their next president will be.\n\nThis entirely undemocratic, arcane, draconian, and ipso facto rigged aspect of the US electoral system came to a crucial dead-end during the New York primaries of the Democratic and Republican parties on April 19, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won their respective primaries.\n\nIn many significant ways, the presidential primaries in New York were a turning point in the unfolding saga of Bernie Sanders' bid for the US presidency.\n\nHis crushing defeat by the former state secretary marks a decisive setback that may, in fact, end his candidacy and usher his massively popular campaign into a new phase, with or without the prospect of US presidency.\n\nSo crucial was this victory for Clinton that soon after this primary, the New York Times - which now openly, unabashedly, and against any norm of journalistic decency or professionalism acts as the official organ of Clinton's campaign - was so confident of her victory that it began to speculate about who her running mate might be.\n\nThese primaries were not like any other; New York is the financial, commercial, cultural, and intellectual capital of the US. What happens in New York (and a few other major cosmopolitan epicenters like Chicago and San Francisco) is, in many ways, the barometer of the nation at large.\n\nSome 20 million people live in the state of New York, of which about 8.4 million live just in New York City. This population figure places New York City above many European democracies, such as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nNow, consider the fact that according to reports, \"only 19.7 percent of eligible New Yorkers cast a ballot, the second-lowest voter turnout among primary states after Louisiana, according to elections expert Michael McDonald\".\n\nThis is not to mention the fact that even those who were registered Democrats and could not vote: \"The Kings County Board of Elections purged 126,000 registered Democrats from the voting rolls in Brooklyn, prompting an outcry from Mayor Bill de Blasio and an audit from Comptroller Scott Stringer.\"\n\nWhatever the cause of this \"purge\" (fraud or mishap), this is not the main calamity of the electoral process in the US.\n\nThe issue is the fact that less than 20 percent of eligible voters in a statewide election get to choose who the next presidential candidates in the US national elections would be.\n\nThis low number is not any indication of an apathetic low voter turnout, but, in fact, is the evidence of massive voter suppression that, in the racist parlance of the white supremacists, is kept exclusive for what they call \"Third World Banana Republics\".\n\nNow, the question is very simple: What is the difference between the way the Democratic Party functions in New York and many other states and the Communist Party of North Korea, the bete noire of the liberation theologians singing Hallelujah for \"American democracy\"?\n\nSince when can a political party (with an obvious political agenda to promote for its own endurance) violate the inalienable right of citizenship in a republic?\n\nThe principle reason for this voter suppression is what they call in the US \"closed primaries\". What is a closed primary?\n\nNew York is among many other states that conduct what is called \"closed primaries\"; namely, they only allow voters who are registered members of a particular political party to vote in that party's primary.\n\nIt is not, therefore, accidental that much to the chagrin of Sanders and his massive supporters among independents, \"Clinton has won every state so far that's held a closed primary\".\n\nIf, as a citizen, you followed the debates closely and came to the conclusion that Sanders is the candidate of your choice and not Clinton, you would not be allowed to vote for him unless months ago (long before you were familiar with Sanders or his ideas), you had applied to the Democratic Party and become a member.\n\nIt must be a rudimentary fact of any claim to democracy that if you are a citizen of a republic, you must be able to vote in any phase of any presidential (or any other) election simply by virtue of being a citizen.\n\nBut in this crucial phase of the US presidential primaries, these citizens are not allowed to vote unless and until they are card-carrying members of the political party conducting that primary.\n\n\"All animals are equal,\" indeed, as we learned from George Orwell's Animal Farm, \"but some animals are more equal than others\".\n\nAs a result of this blatantly undemocratic practice, if you are an independent-minded person, follow the news and watch the debates before you decide which candidate you prefer and want to vote for in the Democratic primaries in New York, you might as well be a woman trying to drive in Saudi Arabia: You could not.\n\nThe Democratic Party, therefore, rules over this false claim to democracy the same way the Guardian Council of octogenarian Super Mullahs rules over the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn other words, the free and fair formation of political parties that is supposed to be the finest fruit of a democracy has paradoxically degenerated into the most powerful impediment to democracy.\n\nThe question is: What is the result of these undemocratic \"closed primaries\"?\n\nThese \"closed primaries\" are the bottlenecks of a closed political culture, preventing the possibility of any liberating breakthrough into a foreclosed political system.\n\nAt the heart of this imperial republic that effectively rules the world with its military might (not with any moral courage or political legitimacy), we have an electoral process that systematically bars any critical judgment of its own citizens to disrupt its mindless militarism. American citizens are as much trapped inside this corrupt system as people around the globe are at the mercy of its fighter jets and drone attacks.\n\nThese two parties, Republican and Democratic, are today functioning like two identical but competing Orwellian Ministries of Truth - systematically, consistently, unabashedly disallowing any critical thinking or nonviolent democratic action to enter and disrupt the always-already rigged election.\n\nHamid Dabashi is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy."}, "http://q13fox.com/2016/09/16/entire-seattle-high-school-team-kneels-during-national-anthem-before-game/": {"title": "Entire Seattle high school football team kneels during national anthem before game", "keywords": ["news", " sports", " nfl anthem protest"], "url": "http://q13fox.com/2016/09/16/entire-seattle-high-school-team-kneels-during-national-anthem-before-game/", "text": "SEATTLE \u2014 The entire Garfield High School football team, including the coaches, took a knee during the national anthem Friday night before their game against West Seattle High on Friday night to protest \u201csocial injustices.\u201d\n\nOur news partner The Seattle Times captured the action on video:\n\nAfter the game, which Garfield won, Garfield High School head football coach Joey Thomas said that \"the players decided to do this\" to bring attention to \"social injustices,\" emphasizing that it was \"a player-driven\" move and that his players plan to continue the practice during the anthem before every game \"until they tell us to stop.\"\n\nHere is an interview with head coach Joey Thomas:\n\nAbout four or five players on the West Seattle High School team also knelt during the anthem at the Southwest Athletic Complex in the West Seattle area.\n\nSeattle Public Schools issued the following statement: \u201cStudents kneeling during the national anthem are expressing their rights protected by the First Amendment.

But the truth is that Murdoch likes money, and he likes influence which makes him money. While papers continue to hold a place in that schema he\u2019ll keep publishing them, and when they cease providing it he\u2019ll kill them.\n\nWhen the News of the World became a liability in his quest to build his TV empire he had no compunction about shutting it down \u2014 a small source of comfort for the left at the time but more clearly a showing of his disinterest in journalism even from his own side, directed by his own policies, where it conflicted with other priorities.\n\nAnd this is a story repeated across the mainstream news media for the last 20-30 years, as it slid from producing intermittently useful investigative work amid the dross to a reliance on whistleblowing and bloggers to paint a veneer over the husk.\n\nI started working in regional papers shortly after the turn of the millennium. Social media was yet to become truly hegemonic in mediating the online world and Indymedia was a major left platform while libcom hadn\u2019t even started.\n\nBut it was then, not now, when the papers really started to be run down. And the culprits weren\u2019t Facebook, Twitter or even the Canary. The people to blame were sitting on company boards, maximising profits by dismantling the investigative function of their dailies, giving the advertising team priority over editorial, cutting photographers and journalists and subs.\n\nThey had by then collectively acquired monopoly positions on most of their regional holdings \u2014 between them the Big Six firms currently own 81% of all regional print media (in Britain 25% is considered a monopoly). The average county town had maybe one daily offering, with a possible \u201calternative\u201d most often owned by the same firm offering largely pretend competition, often out of the same building and possibly even with the same sub editors doing layout.\n\nJohnston, Trinity Mirror, Newsquest, Archant, each had their own monopoly demesne, tacitly agreed between the press giants. And with monopoly came all the attendant damaging behaviours. Customers treated like idiots, staff treated like burdens, a need to raise short term profit margins in a mature market pressuring bosses to cut standards and corners.\n\nThere were, to be sure, some outside pressures. Print journalism used to rely a lot on car advertising, classifieds and the like for income, which the far better targeted and detailed internet offerings really did kill. Later, the 2007 crisis would also call time on a lot of other advertising which never came back, lost mainly to online. The nationals have also belatedly suffered from this, as despite their greater reach and cachet targeted ads are simply more effective per pound than the static general audience offerings in the dead tree trade. But that wasn\u2019t what really drove the ousting of older, experienced and expensive journalists, or the cutting off of investigative funding.\n\nIn the early 2000s the industry was still doing just about okay, following the general trend in a booming economic climate. But the amount of writing being expected per reporter every day had already jumped enormously on the numbers from ten years prior, largely wiping out the kind of journalism that requires you to be outside the office knocking on doors.\n\nContrary to the line spouted today, newspaper writing was already a victim of short-term bottom line thinking at this stage. The news desk had shed most of its old timers and specialists and was well on its way to a norm of churnalism and wire rewrites after years of cuts by bosses looking for growth in a market with little growth potential.\n\nWhat this meant, the consequences it would have for the long term future of an industry reliant entirely on reader trust and a sense of \u201cthis is where to reliably find out what\u2019s happening\u201d to keep sales, was already obvious to workers. The National Union of Journalists, not a tremendously militant union, was very clear that it would lead to a collapse of respect for the trade followed by a break with the habit of buying papers that would probably not return.\n\nBut all warnings went ignored. The short term gains were the important bit, not standards, not the retention of skills and trust.\n\nWhen the bubble began to burst, as I entered the trade, bosses started to see the impact of their decisions. Sales were falling. Advertising was falling. Yet rather than listen they doubled down on cuts, reasoning that with new technology should come productivity gains.\n\nThey sacked photographers early, increasingly giving out cheap cameras to their writers and calling it \u201cphotojournalism.\u201d The quality of the photos coming through duly suffered. They took more advantage of the national agency wires, now easily cut and pasted from online, to fill out room. Their foreign and national news coverage duly suffered, as lacking a reporter with national contacts and experience they lost out on the local angles of Westminster lawmaking. They cut the budget for reporters to get out to stories, relying on police and council press releases and a couple of quick phone calls to build articles instead. The quality of their crime and local beat reports duly suffered.\n\nJobs sloughed away every year. The news and subbing desks were cut, and reports for one paper were simply reordered for other editions and slips rather than finding bespoke local angles. Eventually desks were merged into hubs. Smaller local papers were de facto closed and production \u201cconsolidated\u201d to other sites, sometimes based in completely different counties or covering vastly different populations.\n\nIn London for example, specialist regional firm Archant currently runs 17 London papers out of two sites in Barking and Hampsted, with barely a reporter to be seen in the communities where they are trying to sell their papers. The direct result of this has been a stunning collapse in reader numbers, illustrated in the chart below from 2016:\n\nDespite a bullish report from Archant that its papers were the only ones to record growth, the Ilford Recorder is the only major riser, largely achieved through shifting to a free distribution model in an effort to boost paid advertising rather than gaining new readers. The rest of the field was a nationwide disaster zone, with bottom-placed The Birmingham Post losing nearly 40% of its readers in just one year.\n\nThe Post is a case study in this tale of barely-managed decline, seeing a move out of the city centre in 2008 (key because it means there\u2019s no easy route for \u201cwalk-ins\u201d), a shift to weekly production with the loss of 80 jobs in 2009, another 25 in 2015 along with the editor, and ten more jobs going this year (described as 20% of the remaining staff). The language used is instructive in this process, with \u201cin-depth business news and analysis\u201d usually meaning \u201cfree columns from a corporate mate of the editor\u201d and \u201cwrite to predetermined story shapes\u201d meaning \u201cwe\u2019re not going to bother to sub or lay this out properly.\u201d Apparently the website\u2019s popular though, so that\u2019s alright.\n\nMost of this is not the internet\u2019s fault, and it\u2019s certainly not down to the Canary, or Novara Media. Fake and alternative news didn\u2019t create a dearth of interest and trust in local fare, which of course feeds into a similar attitude to national news as it goes through its own version of the process. Audiences simply reacted entirely logically to the deliberate evisceration of local news as anything but a platform for advertising by ceasing to take it seriously or bother paying for it.\n\nIt\u2019s an easy rhetorical fix for the press chiefs and their tamer employees to blame outside disruption, or the \u201ceasily-led masses,\u201d for industry woes. But the pit was dug long before by people using the same basic playbook as Murdoch, mistaking the existing loyalty of their readers for a guaranteed income regardless of how they cut away at the roots of that loyalty.\n\nThe relentless nosedive of local journalism into irrelevancy did indeed open the way for other outlets and gift social media with an easy run as a lone source of raw information, some of it poorly researched or even deliberately inaccurate. But if you can\u2019t, for example, find the resources to commit a reporter to a frack site, building up contacts and information properly, what you end up with is someone copy-pasting the police press release and the frack firm\u2019s PR release, while your frack-skeptical audience flocks to alternative sites with different sourcing.\n\nThe solution has always been to spend more resources to improve the quality of the reporting on offer. But bosses are constitutionally incapable of doing this, painted into a corner by the need to placate shareholders with annual improvements to the company bottom line regardless of long-term sustainability.\n\nBig media local journalism (and this also feeds into national journalism through the collapsing quality of staff feeding through) in fact seems systemically unable at this point to provide the sort of old-fashioned legwork that would make it relevant again. And this is also a problem for radicals to take note of, inasmuch as for all the often seriously dodgy politics of regional papers, that ground floor information has always been a major plank in the secondary research we rely on.\n\nCouncil reports, parish information, planning application stories, little articles on locals getting pissed off with something happening in their back yard, a lack of reporting on these tremors adds up until an earthquake like Grenfell happens. Then, of course, the national media notices a problem with their feeders, but such decline in the fourth estate function of the press is once again passed off as just a victim of technology and the rise of alternative media rather than as the denouement of capitalistic processes.\n\nThe irony of the criticisms of alternative media, the new left press or whatever you want to call it is that they only exist, the opportunity is only there, because the mainstream media chewed off its own leg. It originally stamped on radical rivals through a combination of rhetoric over professional impartiality and spending serious money on outpacing, outresearching and outreaching them, but has for the most part long-since jettisoned those strengths now.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the big standouts in print journalism, the ones which have survived the best and retained their readers, are the likes of the near-enough specialist Financial Times and (in regional) the Camden New Journal, which also happens to be one of the last independent papers left. Editor Eric Gordon noted recently:\n\nThe fact is that over the years there are fewer journalists and therefore, of course, what you call investigative reporting is now much less often done than it used to be years ago. There is little doubt about that.\n\nThe CNJ is a multi-award winner on the regional circuit despite lacking the muscle of the big six, and exposes the skills and investment vacuum that is the real reason for the crisis in confidence and sales which has afflicted the industry. An unashamedly old-fashioned paper which prioritises editorial, it\u2019s bucked every trend going and remains, very much against the norm, a highly trusted outfit with a whopping 66% of Camdenites seeing it as \u201ctheir\u201d paper.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since the left genuinely had a press worthy of the name pulling for it. The Mirror and the Guardian are centre-left at best and even there, neither are often fond of effective trade unions. Both rate even Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s jobbing social democratism as somewhere between distasteful and terrifying, barely touching upon more radical ideas. In the absence of both them and a press run by the capitalists, there\u2019s a gaping hole in news for consumption, which on a national level is being slowly filled by the likes of Skwawkbox, Novara Media, the Canary and even perennial old-timer the Morning Star. In the US, It\u2019s Going Down is taking advantage of the Trump-rejuvenated radical landscape to run an anarchist-specific outlet of its own.\n\nAll of them have a long way to go however, with few resources and precious little expertise to work with. The pitfalls of operating in the extraordinarily complex British legal system and audience base, even as the old media titans lash their tails, are enormous and intimidating. A single solid libel case, a poor understanding of reporting privileges or a piece falling foul of reporting restrictions could wipe out any or all of them. As the excitement factor of having new media itself dies away, leaving the need to consolidate into a mature form and move beyond merely re-packaging the raw stories of other outlets, the transition could kill any or all of them. And the big players still, for now, have enough muscle to outspend local startups on ad rates and operate at a loss for long periods to maintain local dominance which could strangle any or all of them.\n\nThe Media Fund is an interesting effort to work on the financial end, but whether this will be a sustainable way of supporting its many members is anybody\u2019s guess. There\u2019s a lot of looking around for options going on, and a great deal of learning yet to be done.\n\nA minority of the people involved have a journalistic background, which offers both strengths (not following the crowd or the old ways) and weaknesses including both the above, and an inability to even touch a vast arena of subjects, from court reporting to the events of everyday life outside politics that are just as important to building audiences, such as sport. The most successful radical media project in British history remains the Daily Worker, which was read as much for its racing coverage as its take on world events. We are, as a broad politic, quite bad at looking interested in people\u2019s hobbies and likes, and reporting on them is itself a full-time job.\n\nWe need to look at and understand the guts of professional journalism, the structuring, the skills, the useful bits of training which provide the backbone of its still extremely efficient processes. And we need to be prepared for the inevitable backlash if success is achieved, not just from media rivals but from the state and companies which, let us not forget, are quite happy to boycott when their interests are threatened and in a far more coherent way than consumers can usually manage.\n\nBut the opportunity is there \u2014 and thanks to capitalist media\u2019s cannibalistic tendencies, it\u2019s growing. But to really build our own must-read outlets we do need to achieve something that the mainstream media had and still, to a much lesser degree, has. We need a network of groups like the Bristolian, the Stirrer and the Meteor who can write and understand their patch inside out producing not just re-nosed copy or observations about what\u2019s happening in the mainstream, but solid information on stories which aren\u2019t already being told. We need specialist teams like Corporate Watch. And we need to work together."}, "http://sebaxxxtian.tumblr.com/post/28159528220": {"title": "", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://sebaxxxtian.tumblr.com/post/28159528220", "text": ""}, "http://www.non-compete.com/net-neutrality-was-always-doomed-by-capitalism/": {"title": "Net Neutrality Was Always Doomed by Capitalism", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.non-compete.com/net-neutrality-was-always-doomed-by-capitalism/", "text": "We called our congress reps and senators, we wrote letters to government officials, we signed petitions, and we hammered out thousands of angry Tweets and blog posts, but it happened all the same: Yesterday the FCC repealed regulations that guaranteed net neutrality for American citizens despite the fact that 80% of Americans are in favor of maintaining net neutrality regulations.\n\nMany liberals are stunned by the move, which gives powerful corporations even more control over our daily lives and threatens our freedom to benefit from the most incredible human communication system the world has ever known. Leftists, on the other hand, understand that it was only a matter of time before the internet would become partitioned off and commodified by the capitalist class.\n\nIn the 19th century, Karl Marx laid down the foundation for the theory of historical materialism. Marx suggested that human society is fundamentally determined at any given time by material conditions \u2014 the relationships people have with each other to fulfill their basic needs of survival such as food, clothing, shelter, and so on. From the historical materialist viewpoint, human history has been a constant struggle between different classes vying for supremacy through various predictable stages.\n\nThe key battleground for this never-ending class conflict has always been the means of production \u2014 the resources that are necessary to meet the material conditions of society. During the feudal stage of history, the most important material need was food, which required a tremendous amount of time and labor to produce. Because of this, the most important means of production in feudal society was the land itself. Kings and aristocrats battled for the land while peasants and serfs served as little more than slaves to develop the land and produce food to meet the materials needs of society. In exchange for their work this peasant class were allowed to have homes on the lord\u2019s lands and were given enough food to survive.\n\nOver time, a capitalist class emerged and grew incredibly powerful by advancing and developing industry. This lead to farming methods becoming much more advanced, so that more food could be produced with much less land and labor. Industry supplanted agriculture as the means of production of primary importance in society. The factory owners were the new rulers of society and the working class emerged. Workers were paid in wages and money became much more important to societal organization. Money itself came to be the new hallmark of power, and wealthy robber barons emerged who were just as mighty as any king had ever been.\n\nOver time, workers began to develop a consciousness of the nature of class struggle. They began to form trade unions and organize to resist capitalist oppression. The capitalists fought back, often violently, and class conflict took on a new character.\n\nAlthough industrial technology has advanced rapidly through the centuries, the nature of class conflict remains the same as it has been since Marx first developed his ideas nearly two centuries ago. Capitalists still fight to accrue as much power for their class as possible while the working class continues to struggle for freedom from capitalist oppression and to meet their material needs for survival.\n\nIn this sense, capitalism can be seen as a process. Capitalists and their corporations must maintain a constant rate of growth. Profits for shareholders must always increase over time. As these corporations grow larger and more powerful, they must seek out more markets in which to turn a profit. As the capitalist classes of nations develop, they will eventually grow so powerful that they are able to exploit poorer nations through imperialistic processes that force poorer people to work for lower wages to produce goods for the more wealthy homeland.\n\nThe United States of America entered this advanced stage of imperialist-capitalism some time in the late 20th century. In the decades since World War II, United States corporations have developed a global reach that exploits workers domestically and globally to rob wealth from the working class and transfer it to a small number of wealthy capitalist families.\n\nThe growth of capitalist power can only be sustained by developing new markets and convincing \u2013 or commanding \u2013 working class people into spending more money on capitalist-produced products and services.\n\nAs such, it is the nature of capitalists to \u201cseek rent.\u201d Rent-seeking is the process of increasing wealth without creating new wealth. In other words, capitalists will always try to make more money without producing any more value, whenever and wherever possible.\n\nSometimes capitalists seek rent through marketing. For example, when you buy a new smart phone at Verizon they will always try to get you to buy over-priced accessories like screen protectors and charging cables at exorbitantly marked-up prices.\n\nOther times capitalists seek rent through government lobbying and coercion. This can include demanding that governments subsidize their businesses and give them benefits and hand-outs, or simply pushing legislators and officials to pass laws and regulations that benefit their business directly at the expense of working class consumers.\n\nExample of legislative rent-seeking include mega-farms pushing for farm subsidies that help them reap obscene profits and giant corporations like Amazon demanding billion dollar incentives from local governments as bribes to open offices and facilities in their cities.\n\nThe internet has become the single most important means of production in the world. There is not a single corporation that doesn\u2019t require the web to do business. Working people also require the internet to do their jobs, educate themselves, fill out government forms and job applications, and communicate with one another. The internet today is every bit as important to us as farmland was to feudal society.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s only natural that the capitalist class would seek rent from the internet by influencing the state to remove regulations that would interfere with the growth of their profits and power. This is the nature of class struggle \u2014 behavior that has repeated throughout history since the capitalists first wrenched power from the feudal class.\n\nPerhaps the most outrageous aspect of this issue is that capitalists believe they have a right to own and control the internet at all. The internet was not developed by any individual capitalist. It is the end result of millions of humans toiling over hundreds of years to develop and refine science and technology.\n\nAs Pyotr Kropotkin puts it in The Conquest of Bread:\n\nYet the capitalists will always seek to own and commodify the internet. They will always seek to collect rent on internet services through whatever means they can exploit. Corporations will never stop seeing you and all of your personal and private activities and relationships as products and revenue sources.\n\nLobbying our representatives is fine and good, but even if we receive some legislative relief from congress as it pertains to net neutrality it can only ever be a temporary stop-gap. As long as the capitalist class is allowed to own the means of production which humanity has collectively developed class struggle will continue and the ruling class will continue to seek to oppress us and limit our freedoms.\n\nYesterday was just one more day in which we lost a battle with our capitalist oppressors. But today \u2014 tomorrow \u2014 any day can become the day we take back all that we\u2019ve lost! As Marx writes: \u201cIf conquest constitutes a natural right on the part of the few, the many have only to gather sufficient strength in order to acquire the natural right of reconquering what has been taken from them.\u201d\n\nThe only lasting solution to the issue of net neutrality, as for all problems of inequity and freedom from oppression on this earth, is to end the practice of capitalism and develop a society that is socialist and truly democratic in nature. We, the workers of the world, must unite and demand that which is ours by right \u2014 a free and neutral internet which is shared and enjoyed by all without restriction or limitation."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/08/german-metal-workers-strike-in-bid-to-gain-28-hour-working-weeks": {"title": "German workers strike for right to two-year, 28-hour working week", "keywords": ["Germany", "Unions", "Europe", "World news"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/08/german-metal-workers-strike-in-bid-to-gain-28-hour-working-weeks", "text": "Workers have downed tools at more than 80 companies across Germany as the country\u2019s biggest union stepped up its campaign for a 28-hour working week to allow employees to improve their work-life balance.\n\nIn what is shaping up to be the biggest industrial dispute in the metalwork sector in three decades, more than 15,000 employees took part in warning strikes at factories including those of the carmaker Porsche.\n\nThe IG Metall union, which represents around 3.9 million workers, wants every employee in the metal and electrical sector to have the option to reduce their working hours for a total period of two years, with the automatic right to return to full-time employment afterwards.\n\n\n\nGerman family policy took a shift in 2007 when a so-called \u201ceducational\u201d benefit mainly aimed at mothers was replaced with a \u201cparental benefit\u201d that can be shared between the mother and father of a child.\n\nUnder the union proposals, workers who opt for a 28-hour week in order to take care of young children or ageing parents would get an additional allowance of \u20ac200 per month. Those who want to take a break from doing shift work with a high health risk would be compensated with \u20ac750 per year.\n\n\n\nWith the German economy in robust health and unemployment at record lows, IG Metall is also calling for a 6% pay increase across the sector.\n\n\u201cWe want employers to recognise that traditional gender roles in modern families are changing, and we want workers to have the chance to do work that is important to society,\u201d a union spokesperson said. \u201cIn the past, demands for more flexibility has come at the cost of workers. We want to flick a switch so that flexible working also benefits workers.\u201d\n\nEmployers\u2019 associations have rejected the union\u2019s proposals, complaining that it would be too costly if, as predicted, up to a quarter of companies\u2019 staff switch to the 28-hour model.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot meet the demands for compensatory wage increases,\u201d said Oliver Zander, director of Gesamtmetall, in an interview with Die Welt newspaper. \u201cAt a time when there is a shortage of skilled personnel it would be mad to give an incentive to reduce urgently needed operating volume.\u201d\n\nGermany has around 1.1m job vacancies, and in a recent poll by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) more than half of all companies cited a shortage of skilled workers as the biggest risk facing their business.\n\nThe employers\u2019 group has compiled a legal dossier arguing that IG Metall\u2019s proposals are illegal since they discriminate against workers who have already opted to permanently work fewer hours.\n\nIt has further argued that employers could only allow some workers to work shorter hours if in turn the union allowed others to sign contracts for a 40-hour week.\n\nIn Germany, where large companies are required by law to have workers\u2019 representatives on their boards, industrial relations have traditionally been more consensus-based than in Britain or France.\n\nThe last major dispute in Germany\u2019s metal-working sector came in the 1980s, when union demands for a 35-hour working week led to months of walkouts at factories across the country.\n\nIG Metall launched an unsuccessful campaign of strikes in 2003 aiming to introduce a 35-hour working week in the states that formerly were part of East Germany. Fifteen years later, many metal workers in the former GDR continue to work 37 hours per week.\n\nIn Britain, where collective bargaining has over the years become dramatically decentralised, 37-hour working weeks remain the norm in the metalwork sector, in spite of efforts by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.\n\nA third round of collective bargaining is scheduled to begin in Germany on 11 January. If the talks fail to yield a compromise, IG Metall could move from warning strikes to targeting individual factories with full-day stoppages."}, "http://kurdishquestion.com/article/3571-belgian-court-decides-armed-struggle-not-terrorism-in-turkey-acquits-kurdish-politicians": {"title": "Mehmet Aksoy", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://kurdishquestion.com/article/3571-belgian-court-decides-armed-struggle-not-terrorism-in-turkey-acquits-kurdish-politicians", "text": "Our founder and editor-in-chief, our friend, our comrade, our loved one, our incredible activist, political organizer, writer, film-maker, our world, our everything,has become a martyr on the path to a more just, more free, more beautiful life.We honour him with our deepest respect and promise to keep the torch of revolution alive.We love you, heval.

Through times of tranquility and the throes of change, the Constitution has always guided our course toward fulfilling that most noble promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve the chance to pursue their full measure of happiness. America has carried on not only for the skill or vision of history's celebrated figures, but also for the generations who have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents. On Loyalty Day, we reflect on that proud heritage and press on in the long journey toward prosperity for all.\n\nIn the years since our Constitution was penned and ratified, Americans have moved our Nation forward by embracing a commitment to each other, to the fundamental principles that unite us, and to the future we share. We weathered the storms of civil war and segregation, of conflicts that spanned continents. We overcame threats from within and without -- from the specter of fascism abroad to the bitter injustice of disenfranchisement at home. We upheld the spirit of service at the core of our democracy, and we widened the circle of opportunity not just for a privileged few, but for the ambitious many. Time and again, men and women achieved what seemed impossible by joining imagination to common purpose and necessity to courage. That legacy still burns brightly, and the ideals it embodies remain a light to all the world.\n\nCountless Americans demonstrate that same dedication to country today. It endures in the hearts of all who put their lives on the line to defend the land they love, just as it moves millions to improve their communities through volunteerism and civic participation. Their actions help ensure prosperity for this generation and those yet to come, and they honor the immutable truths enshrined in our Nation's founding texts. On Loyalty Day, we rededicate ourselves to the common good, to the cornerstones of liberty, equality, and justice, and to the unending pursuit of a more perfect Union.\n\nIn order to recognize the American spirit of loyalty and the sacrifices that so many have made for our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529 as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as \"Loyalty Day.\" On this day, let us reaffirm our allegiance to the United States of America, our Constitution, and our founding values.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2012, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty Day, I call upon all the people of the United States to join in support of this national observance, whether by displaying the flag of the United States or pledging allegiance to the Republic for which it stands.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth."}, "http://rednblacksalamander.deviantart.com/art/Riot-Armor-535259738": {"title": "Riot Armor", "keywords": ["Art", " Digital Art", " Photography", " Traditional Art", " Community Art", " Contemporary Art", " Modern Art", " Skins", " Themes", " Poetry", " Prose", " Applications", " Wallpapers", " Online Art", " cartoons", " traditional", " drawings"], "url": "http://rednblacksalamander.deviantart.com/art/Riot-Armor-535259738", "text": "Seems like the only way to get white America's attention."}, "http://mediamilwaukee.com/top-stories/milo-yiannopoulos-milwaukee-tour-twitter-uw-uwm-transgender-lockerroom-policy-breitbart-alt-right": {"title": "Trans Student Adelaide Kramer Tells UWM Chancellor Off After Milo Talk", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://mediamilwaukee.com/top-stories/milo-yiannopoulos-milwaukee-tour-twitter-uw-uwm-transgender-lockerroom-policy-breitbart-alt-right", "text": "The UW-Milwaukee transgender student who was singled out by controversial speaker Milo Yiannopoulos sent an angry, expletive-filled email to Chancellor Mark Mone, accusing the chancellor of insulting her and engaging in \u201cgoddamn lip service.\u201d\n\n\u201cGO F-CK YOURSELF,\u201d Adelaide Karen Kramer \u2013 whose photo Yiannopoulos projected onto a screen during his speech \u2013 started the email, which she sent to the chancellor and 458 members of the university community on December 14, the morning after Breitbart editor Yiannopoulos spoke to a sold-out crowd in the Wisconsin Room at the UWM Student Union. Kramer was responding to an email that Mone sent to all students and faculty after Yiannopoulos\u2019 incendiary speech, in which he mocked Kramer and referenced whether he would want to have sex with her.\n\n\u201cDo you have any f-cking idea how hurtful this is? Do you know what it\u2019s like to be in a room full of people who are laughing at you as if you\u2019re some sort of perverted freak, and how many of them would have hollered at me (or worse) if I was outed? Do you know what this kind of terror is?\u201d Kramer wrote the chancellor of the Milwaukee public university. (Kramer was featured in a recent in-depth profile by Media Milwaukee, which reported that UWM still does not have a clear formal policy for transgender students\u2019 use of locker rooms at the Klotsche Center. You can read that here.)\n\nIn another sign of how heated the fallout continued to be in the wake of Yiannopoulos\u2019 speech, a Libertarian student group at UW-Milwaukee, Young Americans for Liberty, received a threat of violence on Facebook the day after the talk.\n\nMone\u2019s original email was sent to the campus community:\n\nIn his email, Mone had said, \u201cI do not agree with Yiannopoulos\u2019 views, and I strongly condemn the belittling of others and their appearance, and the encouragement of hate and harassment. I also will not stand silently by when a member of our campus community is personally and wrongly attacked. I am disappointed that this speaker chose to attack a transgender student.\u201d\n\nHowever, that student, Kramer, was extremely unhappy with Mone\u2019s response. In her email, which was sent at 7:52 a.m., Kramer wrote to Mone, \u201cYour words: \u2018I also will not stand silently by when a member of our campus community is personally and wrongly attacked.\u2019 That is probably the biggest piece of goddamn f-cking bullsh-t I\u2019ve ever read. What exactly do you plan to do? OH YEAH, NOTHING, BECAUSE YOU\u2019RE A COWARDLY PIECE OF SH-T. Your [sic] \u2018not standing silently\u2019 apparently consists of a single email mass-sent to the university. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t get a f-cking cookie for that. What else were you going to go? NOTHING. You were planning on doing jack sh-t.\u201d Read the full email below (warning: Graphic language):\n\nKramer vividly described how she was at the speech when Yiannopolous put a photo of her on the screen and criticized her, writing, \u201cI also knew Milo was going to regurgitate a profound amount of racist and transphobic hate. What I did not anticipate was being specifically targeted and called out in the way he did. I hadn\u2019t said anything or made even the slightest disruption: He had his harassment of me planned out well in advance. I\u2019m sitting there and I hear him say \u2018Justine Kramer\u2019 and I just froze up. I have never, ever, ever been more terrified in my life of being outed. Ever.\u201d (Justine Kramer was Adelaide\u2019s former name.)\n\nShe accused the university of allowing the speech, saying, \u201cThis also isn\u2019t just a case of a speaker going off an a tangent like that, like some random occurrence. It was not a case where you had no way of knowing he would do this. Quite the contrary: Milo has a supremely extensive, highly-documented track record of doing precisely this. As I\u2019ve already said, YOU KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN. WE TOLD YOU IT WOULD. AND WE TOLD YOU AGAIN. AND AGAIN.\u201d Kramer questioned whether a \u201cmodern Hitler\u201d would be allowed to speak on campus. Read a December 7 story on Media Milwaukee that discussed student protests of Yiannopoulos\u2019 speech before it occurred.\n\nMichelle Johnson of University Relations & Communications provided this statement in response to Kramer\u2019s email:\n\nAs you know, Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 speech was sponsored by a student organization, Turning Point USA. The university administration felt it had to allow his visit because the university cannot bar a speaker based on his or her views when the speaker has been invited by a student organization. Administrators consulted the Student Association on this point and were told the university\u2019s decision was consistent with campus policy.\n\nThat said, the administration does not in any way share or support Yiannopoulos\u2019 views, and we understand and empathize with the students and employees who opposed his appearance and are distressed by his remarks.\n\nKnowing Yiannopoulos\u2019 reputation for making controversial remarks, we sent several email messages before his appearance, advising students and employees of counseling and other resources available to them. We didn\u2019t know in advance if Milo would target anyone specific on our campus, so we couldn\u2019t reach out to any particular individual before the speech.\n\nWe did feel that it was important to respond quickly in the student\u2019s defense. Because the event ended late, a staff member reached out to the student this morning to let her know about counseling and other available support services. We hope they can connect, and the student will take advantage of those services.\n\nMone had faced pressure from some students before the speech to condemn it. (Read Media Milwaukee\u2019s live blog on the speech here.)\n\nYiannopoulos, a Cambridge University dropout, public speaker, and entrepreneur, is notoriously known for his provocations and getting his Twitter account banned. He has been on tour speaking at universities across America. Being the senior editor at Breitbart News, he has been labeled the \u201cAlt-Right.\u201d He has denied this title in the past. Some campuses have banned his appearances due to \u201csecurity issues.\u201d The University of Colorado-Boulder students launched a petition to stop Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 event.\n\nHis UWM speech was met with protests from a group calling itself the Coalition Against the Ultra Right, which organized through Facebook. The group marched into the student union just before Yiannopolous took the stage. Some of the protesters had tickets and began to disrupt the event, by standing up, booing, and yelling obscenities, including giving him the finger. Supporters chanted back \u201cUSA\u201d in support of the British journalist. A student journalist was banned from taking photos outside and inside the event, and media passes were not granted.\n\nMeanwhile, 50 protesters gathered outside the ground floor of the UWM Student Union. It was a frigid evening, and their faces were covered with an array of fabric, but it is unclear if it was for the weather or to maintain anonymity. They were met by a coalition of about 15 officers from four jurisdictions who attempted to keep the peace.\n\nYiannopolous made a series of incendiary remarks during his speech. He said at one point, \u201cFirst of all we should talk a little bit about where we are. The land, Wisconsin, of cheese, alcohol, and clinically obese lesbians. They are. They are.\u201d He then added, \u201cCheese, alcohol, and obese lesbians, three things that really I can\u2019t live without.\u201d He also said he was attracted to America by Constitutional values.\n\n\u201cBut I found that it was being ruined by people who believed that gender, skin color and sexuality were more important than ideas. It would be nice if America would remember what made it great in the first place. If any of you have been offended this evening, good. Stop allowing these people who want to divide you by their stupid categories to control how you see the world.\u201d\n\nYiannopolous brought up Kramer about 25 minutes into the speech, just after finishing a joke about feminists who critique the phrase \u201cman up.\u201d Watch:\n\nYiannopolous then stated, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one UW-Milwaukee student that does not need to man up, and that is Justine Kramer.\u201d Justine is Adelaide Kramer\u2019s former name.\n\nHe then proceeded to identify the student.\n\n\u201cDo you know about Justine Kramer? Have any of you come into contact with this person? This quote unquote nonbinary trans \u2013 you\u2019re not laughing now, are you, you know him \u2013 this quote unquote nonbinary trans woman forced his way into the women\u2019s locker rooms this year. Who knows about this story, any of you?\u201d\n\nWhat happened next was a picture of the student projected on the screen. Laughter filled the room after Yiannopoulos continued to comment.\n\nKramer had been featured in the lengthy Media Milwaukee profile story that ran December 9, and she also was the subject of local news coverage last spring when controversy erupted over UWM\u2019s locker room policy for transgender students. That subtext helps explain her anger at Mone because her email references her belief that UW-Milwaukee is not welcoming to transgender students, a sentiment explored in the profile.\n\n\u201cIn January 2016, a transgender woman \u2014 a student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee \u2014 was asked to leave the women\u2019s locker room at the fitness center. When she filed a complaint, UW-Milwaukee\u2019s provost said she was welcome to use the locker room, but only if she covered up her \u2018non-conforming genitalia.\u2019 LGBTQ experts say the response is \u2018deeply flawed\u2019 and singles out trans people for extra scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe story reported that UW-Milwaukee still lacks a clear formal public policy on locker rooms, noting that UWM \u201cis keeping the policy under wraps until administrators figure out what to do.\u201d\n\nThe story quoted UW-Milwaukee Interim Senior Student Affairs Officer Jim Hill as saying, \u201cThere is no firm timeline for this because law in this area is still developing.\u201d\n\nKramer told the news site that she was transferring to St. Cloud Minnesota to finish her engineering degree saying that, \u201cI really thought this might be a place where I could finally be my true self, but it\u2019s not.\u201d Adelaide, who just celebrated her 25th birthday, added: \u201cIf I could sum up my experience at UWM in one word, it would be \u2018disappointment.\u2019\u201d The university says she is now a former student.\n\nIn her email to Mone on December 14, Kramer described herself as a \u201cformer student at this godforsaken university.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can keep listing more things but you know what, just go f-ck yourself and in all honestly, drop your T from LGBT,\u201d Adelaide wrote. \u201cQuit pretending. You do not stand for or represent trans folk and you ignore our needs. As-hole. You are LGB at best and a complete transphobic jerk. I\u2019m done with you. Coming to this university was one of the single-most, worst mistakes I have ever made in my life. At the time you were supposedly ranked 5 stars for LGBTQ+ friendliness and sold me a colossal amount of bullsh-t to that effect. HA! WHAT A F-CKING JOKE. I really do genuinely regret ever coming here. It was a mistake.\u201d\n\nMorgan Paradis, of the campus organization, Young Americans for Liberty, said of Kramer\u2019s email, \u201cI don\u2019t feel good that her feelings were hurt. But, the singling out started when she agreed to do the story. Once it became a public story one could expect some amount of disagreement. All I see he (Yiannopoulos) was doing was commenting on a public story in the news.\u201d\n\nParadis\u2019 organization originally invited Yiannopoulos in July, but their national organization thought it would violate their non-profit status so the group Turning Point USA became his official sponsor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a cultural icon for conservatives; he just represents not being worried about offending people,\u201d Paradis said. \u201cPeople need to lighten up.\u201d\n\nWhat about Kramer\u2019s hurt feelings? \u201cDon\u2019t go here then. Get over it,\u201d said Paradis. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with BLM but they just had a big event this semester but I didn\u2019t try to shut it down.\u201d\n\nIn his email, Mone concluded, \u201cWe are at a pivotal moment in our nation\u2019s history after a contentious and divisive election. We can continue to use language that widens the divide. Or, we can choose language that bridges gaps and heals. I urge you to join me in seeking ways to reach out and find common ground.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI also urge you to respond to tonight\u2019s event with positive messages, not anger. Join me on social media in using #UWMstandstogether to tell our city, state and nation about the wonderful things happening on our campus and the valuable contributions of our students, faculty and staff.\u201d\n\nSome people were using the hashtag on December 14:\n\nFollow Media Milwaukee on Facebook for more stories and updates.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Yiannopoulos\u2019 quote on cheese, alcohol and lesbians has been updated to accurately reflect what he said in full on that point."}, "http://rt.com/usa/california-man-13-prison-banks-237/": {"title": "California man faces 13 years in jail for scribbling anti-bank messages in chalk", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://rt.com/usa/california-man-13-prison-banks-237/", "text": "Jeff Olson, the 40-year-old man who is being prosecuted for scrawling anti-megabank messages on sidewalks in water-soluble chalk last year now faces a 13-year jail sentence. A judge has barred his attorney from mentioning freedom of speech during trial.\n\nAccording to the San Diego Reader, which reported on Tuesday that a judge had opted to prevent Olson\u2019s attorney from \"mentioning the First Amendment, free speech, free expression, public forum, expressive conduct, or political speech during the trial,\u201d Olson must now stand trial for on 13 counts of vandalism. \n\n\n\nIn addition to possibly spending years in jail, Olson will also be held liable for fines of up to $13,000 over the anti-big-bank slogans that were left using washable children's chalk on a sidewalk outside of three San Diego, California branches of Bank of America, the massive conglomerate that received $45 billion in interest-free loans from the US government in 2008-2009 in a bid to keep it solvent after bad bets went south. \n\n\n\nThe Reader reports that Olson\u2019s hearing had gone as poorly as his attorney might have expected, with Judge Howard Shore, who is presiding over the case, granting Deputy City Attorney Paige Hazard's motion to prohibit attorney Tom Tosdal from mentioning the United States' fundamental First Amendment rights. \n\n\n\n\"The State's Vandalism Statute does not mention First Amendment rights,\" ruled Judge Shore on Tuesday. \n\n\n\nUpon exiting the courtroom Olson seemed to be in disbelief. \n\n\n\n\"Oh my gosh,\" he said. \"I can't believe this is happening.\"\n\n\n\nTosdal, who exited the courtroom shortly after his client, seemed equally bewildered. \n\n\n\n\"I've never heard that before, that a court can prohibit an argument of First Amendment rights,\" said Tosdal. \n\n\n\nOlson, who worked as a former staffer for a US Senator from Washington state, was said to involve himself in political activism in tandem with the growth of the Occupy Wall Street movement. \n\n\n\nOn October 3, 2011, Olson first appeared outside of a Bank of America branch in San Diego, along with a homemade sign. Eight days later Olson and his partner, Stephen Daniels, during preparations for National Bank Transfer Day, the two were confronted by Darell Freeman, the Vice President of Bank of America\u2019s Global Corporate Security. \n\n\n\nA former police officer, Freeman accused Olson and Daniels of \u201crunning a business outside of the bank,\u201d evidently in reference to the National Bank Transfer Day activities, which was a consumer activism initiative that sought to promote Americans to switch from commercial banks, like Bank of America, to not-for-profit credit unions. \n\n\n\nAt the time, Bank of America\u2019s debit card fees were among one of the triggers that led Occupy Wall Street members to promote the transfer day. \n\n\n\n\"It was just an empty threat,\" says Olson of Freeman\u2019s accusations. \"He was trying to scare me away. To be honest, it did at first. I even called my bank and they said he couldn't do anything like that.\"\n\n\n\nOlson continued to protest outside of Bank of America. In February 2012, he came across a box of chalk at a local pharmacy and decided to begin leaving his mark with written statements. \n\n\n\n\"I thought it was a perfect way to get my message out there. Much better than handing out leaflets or holding a sign,\" says Olson. \n\n\n\nOver the course of the next six months Olson visited the Bank of America branch a few days per week, leaving behind scribbled slogans such as \"Stop big banks\" and \"Stop Bank Blight.com.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Olson, who spoke with local broadcaster KGTV, one Bank of America branch claimed it had cost $6,000 to clean up the chalk writing. \n\n\n\nPublic records obtained by the Reader show that Freeman continued to pressure members of San Diego\u2019s Gang Unit on behalf of Bank of America until the matter was forwarded to the City Attorney\u2019s office. \n\n\n\nOn April 15, Deputy City Attorney Paige Hazard contacted Freeman with a response on his persistent queries. \n\n\n\n\"I wanted to let you know that we will be filing 13 counts of vandalism as a result of the incidents you reported,\" said Hazard. \n\n\n\nArguments for Olson\u2019s case are set to be heard Wednesday morning, following jury selection. \n\n"}, "https://www.rt.com/usa/266866-environmentalists-leftists-fbi-terrorism/": {"title": "FBI must explain prioritizing environmental activists on its terrorist lists - journalist (VIDEO)", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/266866-environmentalists-leftists-fbi-terrorism/", "text": "The public deserves to know why the FBI singles out environmental or left-wing activists - some from decades ago - as top terrorist suspects on its most wanted lists, as opposed to violent right-wing fugitives, journalist Will Potter told RT.\n\nPotter, an investigative journalist and author of \"Green is the New Red: An Insider's Account of a Social Movement Under Siege,\" recently wrote a post on his website that questions the Federal Bureau of Investigation's terrorism priorities, especially in light of the agency's well-known past abuses. He noted that all of those on the agency's Most Wanted Domestic Terrorism list are either leftists who committed crimes at least 30 years ago, or environmental/animal right's activists accused of property crimes, not physical violence.\n\n\"Over and over again, we're seeing this overreaching of FBI responsibilities, and going after protest groups and politicizing their duties,\" he told RT in an interview. \"It's time for all of us to examine how those powers are being used, and I think it's time for a congressional inquiry as well.\"\n\nPotter pointed to recent revelations exposing the FBI's unlawful surveillance and intelligence gathering aimed at \"extremist\" environmental activists opposed to the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was called \"vital to the security and economy of the United States\" in FBI documents.\n\n\"I think the most important takeaway (of the FBI's domestic terror list) is not the individual crimes or what these people are accused of, but the bigger priorities that the FBI is putting forward,\" he said.\n\n\"The purpose of this list is to put a giant spotlight on what the FBI wants to focus its resources on. And when the FBI is focusing resources on environmentalists, or people who are accused of destroying property, or political activists from the '70s, that means they're not focusing resources on today's criminals and actual right-wing groups that have murdered people and sent anthrax, (and) murdered abortion doctors. That should really give everybody pause of how our taxpayer money is being spent.\"\n\nThe targeting of environmental activists is no accident, Potter explained. It's part of the FBI's current mission and not an aberration, especially in an era of federal legislation, such as the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, a sweeping law that labels and punishes as \"eco-terrorism\" numerous political activities or civil disobedience conducted in the name of animal rights. The law covers action that \"damages or causes the loss of any real or personal property\" or \"places a person in reasonable fear\" of injury.\n\n\"It may seem like isolated incidents where you have these environmentalists on a most-wanted list, or the FBI is talking about animal-rights activists, but these are really systemic problems.\"\n\nPotter said he wants to know how the infamous J. Edgar Hoover-era FBI spying programs, which once targeted Black Panther members and anti-war activists, have evolved to include today's targets despite public admonishments of invasive, repressive surveillance operations.\n\n\"It's important to remember that the FBI has a history of abuses like this,\" he said. \"That's why accountability and oversight are so important. During the 1970s and '80s, there was surveillance and harassment, a program called COINTELPRO spied upon and disrupted social movements. And after that, there were congressional hearings. (Surveillance of activists) was supposed to stop, it was all over with. That was the message we were told. I think now we have to revisit that and find out actually what's the scope of what's taking place today, whether those tactics evolved into something new.\"\n\nPotter said the imbalance in the FBI's most wanted list is exemplified by left-wing environmental or animal-rights activists, who have been included based on property crimes that have not harmed a human being, while right-wing militia members who have perpetrated violence on people are not on the list.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Ag gag\u2019 law criminalizing documentation of farming abuses passed in Wyoming\n\n\"The crimes that the people on this most wanted list are accused of, some of them are serious property crimes,\" he said, \"but it's important to point out that in the history of these groups, no one has ever been hurt, and that's never been their intention, whereas with right-wing groups in particular, militias, sovereign citizens, anti-abortion groups, that's been the explicit purpose.\n\n\"You can't ignore these things when you're prioritizing crime.

Airbnb suspects that several of its units were booked in relation to the gathering. Airbnb said in a statement to BuzzFeed News it established community rules in 2016 that \"make good on our mission of belonging\" and that \"those who are members of the Airbnb community accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age.\" The Airbnb Community Commitment is something signed by all people using the service, Airbnb said, and the company is removing people from the platform who are \"antithetical\" to this policy. They added that they are able to find these users who violate the policy \"through our background check\" and the \"input of our community.\"\n\nJason Kessler, a white supremacist helping to organize the rally, called on Twitter for a boycott of Airbnb because \"we are having our civil rights violated.\"\n\n \"You see this thing going that's going on with Airbnb,\" said Kessler in a video. \"Anybody who is not just in the alt-right, but who is conservative, right-wing or cares about civil liberties should start boycotting Airbnb.

At the time, the mayor and city council said there was nothing they could do to stop the rally. On Monday, City Manager Maurice Jones said at a news conference they would grant Kessler the permit for his rally, but only if he would move it to McIntire Park. He said the decision came after Kessler indicated more than 400 people would be attending the rally, which was the estimated amount in his original permit application.\n\n Signer also shared a statement on Facebook, saying he \"wholeheartedly\" supports the city manager's decision \"because of the ballooning size of the event's attendance,\" and that he felt it balanced the right to free speech and public safety. \"Government has no more central duty than protecting life and property. Given the sheer numbers predicted, the City Manager is right to conclude that this event is incompatible with the dense and urban location of Emancipation Park, right next to our Downtown Mall,\" Signer said in his statement. \"However, at McIntire Park, the voices of all can be heard in a way that's consistent with our duty to the public.\"\n\n In response to the announcement, Kessler tweeted \"Nothing will stop us.\""}, "http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/the-panama-papers-how-the-worlds-rich-and-famous-hide-their-money-offshore": {"title": "The Panama Papers: how the world\u2019s rich and famous hide their money offshore", "keywords": ["World news", "Iceland", "China", "Politics", "Tax havens", "Panama Papers"], "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/the-panama-papers-how-the-worlds-rich-and-famous-hide-their-money-offshore", "text": "The hidden wealth of some of the world\u2019s most prominent leaders, politicians and celebrities has been revealed by an unprecedented leak of millions of documents that show the myriad ways in which the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes.\n\nThe Guardian, working with global partners, will set out details from the first tranche of what are being called \u201cthe Panama Papers\u201d.

That is the painful lesson I have had to learn this year.\n\nAs a scholar-activist working on issues such as sexual assault, Palestine, and anti-fascism, I am used to receiving abusive messages and being publicly maligned. Now, however, attacks on me have reached troubling new heights.\n\nLast month, the Stanford Review, a rightwing publication co-founded by Peter Thiel and based on my university campus, wrote that I have helped set up an \u201corganization [that is] undeniably a chapter of a terrorist group\u201d and demanded my resignation. Their article was picked up by groups like JihadWatch, Campus Fix, Campus Reform, Fox & Friends, and other rightwing media outlets.\n\nThe organization I belong to is called the Campus Antifascist Network. We advocate for organized resistance to fascist violence on campus, and for educating our communities and others as to the nature of fascism today. We claim solidarity with a proud tradition of anti-fascism dating back to the early 20th century. \n\n\n\nThe group was founded shortly after the election of Donald Trump, and responded to the steady rise of a well-funded rightwing campaign on college campuses. We do not \u2013 and never would \u2013 advocate \u2013 for initiating violence.\n\nThe attack on me is part of a broader phenomenon noted by the American Association of University Professors, which claims that college campuses are the new battleground for conservative groups, far-right organizations and white supremacists. These groups are all trying to intimidate faculty and students, to recruit members, and to attract publicity. Not just careers and reputations are on the line \u2013 often personal safety is as well.\n\nToday, we are seeing the resurgence of a wretched phenomenon we thought we had put behind us \u2013 McCarthyism, which involves \u201cthe use of tactics involving personal attacks on individuals by means of widely publicized indiscriminate allegations especially on the basis of unsubstantiated charges\u201d.\n\nProfessors are more than hesitant about fighting back against accusations that emanate from organizations supported by the likes of Peter Thiel or Charlie Kirk, who founded Turning Point USA.\n\nIn recent years, there have been well-publicized cases of academics who have had their syllabuses or social media cherry-picked for allegedly inflammatory statements, and then found themselves on the receiving end of orchestrated harassment campaigns.\n\nCNN ran a story on the increasing numbers of professors like myself who have faced death threats for their political statements and activism. But it\u2019s not just political progressives and radicals who are being hit. Scientists are under attack, too. Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, has received death threats for his work on climate change.\n\nDespite this new and alarming phenomenon on campus, university administrators seem loth to aggressively protect their faculty. My own university has left it to me to press charges, and has chosen not to make any public comment on the Stanford Review\u2019s defamation of my character, despite an open letter supporting me signed by nearly 700 members of the Stanford community.\n\nBesides those who signed letters of support, six constitutional law scholars from the Stanford School of Law wrote a letter to the editor of the Stanford Daily declaring that there was no evidence that I had advocated violence, nor that I am a member of a terrorist group. These then were my sources of support, not the university. Yet this has not stopped the attacks on me.\n\nI don\u2019t have the resources to bring a libel suit \u2013 I cannot out-lawyer a newspaper that has an ally in its founder and major contributor to the university, Peter Thiel. \n\n\n\nThe troubling question is: who does?\n\n"}, "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Dear-Hillary-You-Cant-Be-a-Pro-War-Feminist-20161025-0001.html": {"title": "Dear Hillary: You Can\u2019t Be a Pro-War Feminist", "keywords": ["Hillary Clinton", " Iraq", " Libya", " Honduras", " War & conflict", " Military expenditure", " US & Canada", " United States", " USElection2016"], "url": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Dear-Hillary-You-Cant-Be-a-Pro-War-Feminist-20161025-0001.html", "text": ""}, "https://www.indy100.com/article/nazi-socialist-right-wing-white-supremacists-history-twitter-mikestuchbery-7900001": {"title": "Man says Nazis were socialist, gets schooled by history writer", "keywords": ["", ""], "url": "https://www.indy100.com/article/nazi-socialist-right-wing-white-supremacists-history-twitter-mikestuchbery-7900001", "text": "'Nazi' is the short name.

He also draws attention to the overt racist and classist nature of the decades-long internal \u201cwar\u201d (emphases mine):\n\nWe\u2019re talking about Gotham city. \u2026 We were jumping on guys in the middle of the night, all of that, swooping down on folks all across the country, using these sort of attack tactics that we went out on, that you would use in Vietnam, or some kind of war-torn zone. All of the stuff that we were doing, just calling it the war on drugs. And there wasn\u2019t very many black guys in my position. So when I would go into the war room, where we were setting up all of our drug and gun and addiction task force determining what cities we were going to hit, I would notice that most of the time it always appeared to be urban areas. That\u2019s when I asked the question, well, don\u2019t they sell drugs out in Potomac and Springfield, and places like that? Maybe you all think they don\u2019t, but statistics show they use more drugs out in those areas [rich and white] than anywhere. The special agent in charge, he says \u201cYou know, if we go out there and start messing with those folks, they know judges, they know lawyers, they know politicians. You start locking their kids up, somebody\u2019s going to jerk our chain.\u201d He said they\u2019re going to call us on it, and before you know it, they\u2019re going to shut us down, and there goes your overtime. What I began to see is that the drug war is totally about race. If we were locking up everybody, white and black, for doing the same drugs, they would have done the same thing they did with prohibition. They would have outlawed it. They would have said, \u201cLet\u2019s stop this craziness. You\u2019re not putting my son in jail. My daughter isn\u2019t going to jail.\u201d If it was an equal enforcement opportunity operation, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here anyway. It\u2019s all about fairness, man.

How would I be treated if everything was done equally?\n\nLegal scholar Michelle Alexander masterfully details the overtly racist and classist origins and continued reality of the War on Drugs in her opus The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness. In it, among myriad other pieces of proof evincing this fact, Alexander documents the unmitigated racism of President Nixon, the architect of the War on Drugs.\n\nSome conservative political strategists admitted that appealing to racial fears and antagonisms was central to this strategy [the so-called \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d of Republicans appealing to working-class whites in the South], though it had to be done surreptitiously. H.R. Haldeman, one of Nixon\u2019s key advisers, recalls that Nixon himself deliberately pursued a southern, racial strategy: \u201cHe [President Nixon] emphasized that you have to face that fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to.\u201d Similarly, John Ehrlichman, special counsel to the president, explained the Nixon administration\u2019s campaign strategy of 1968 in this way: \u201cWe\u2019ll go after the racists.\u201d In Ehrlichman\u2019s view, \u201cthat subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon\u2019s statements and speeches.\u201d"}, "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-robbins/the-dark-side-of-vitaminw_b_669716.html": {"title": "The Dark Side of Vitaminwater", "keywords": ["vitamin water lawsuit", "vitamin water sued", "Vitamin Water", "John Robbins", "vitaminwater", "coca cola"], "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-robbins/the-dark-side-of-vitaminw_b_669716.html", "text": "Now here's something you wouldn't expect. Coca-Cola is being sued by a non-profit public interest group, on the grounds that the company's vitaminwater products make unwarranted health claims. No surprise there. But how do you think the company is defending itself?\n\nIn a staggering feat of twisted logic, lawyers for Coca-Cola are defending the lawsuit by asserting that \"no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking vitaminwater was a healthy beverage.\"\n\nDoes this mean that you'd have to be an unreasonable person to think that a product named \"vitaminwater,\" a product that has been heavily and aggressively marketed as a healthy beverage, actually had health benefits?\n\nOr does it mean that it's okay for a corporation to lie about its products, as long as they can then turn around and claim that no one actually believes their lies?\n\nIn fact, the product is basically sugar-water, to which about a penny's worth of synthetic vitamins have been added. And the amount of sugar is not trivial. A bottle of vitaminwater contains 33 grams of sugar, making it more akin to a soft drink than to a healthy beverage.\n\nIs any harm being done by this marketing ploy? After all, some might say consumers are at least getting some vitamins, and there isn't as much sugar in vitaminwater as there is in regular Coke.\n\nTrue. But about 35 percent of Americans are now considered medically obese. Two-thirds of Americans are overweight. Health experts tend to disagree about almost everything, but they all concur that added sugars play a key role in the obesity epidemic, a problem that now leads to more medical costs than smoking.\n\nHow many people with weight problems have consumed products like vitaminwater in the mistaken belief that the product was nutritionally positive and carried no caloric consequences? How many have thought that consuming vitaminwater was a smart choice from a weight-loss perspective? The very name \"vitaminwater\" suggests that the product is simply water with added nutrients, disguising the fact that it's actually full of added sugar.\n\nThe truth is that when it comes to weight loss, what you drink may be even more important than what you eat. Americans now get nearly 25 percent of their calories from liquids. In 2009, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health published a report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, finding that the quickest and most reliable way to lose weight is to cut down on liquid calorie consumption. And the best way to do that is to reduce or eliminate beverages that contain added sugar.\n\nMeanwhile, Coca-Cola has invested billions of dollars in its vitaminwater line, paying basketball stars, including Kobe Bryant and Lebron James, to appear in ads that emphatically state that these products are a healthy way for consumers to hydrate. When Lebron James held his much ballyhooed TV special to announce his decision to join the Miami Heat, many corporations paid millions in an attempt to capitalize on the event. But it was vitaminwater that had the most prominent role throughout the show.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, alleges that vitaminwater labels and advertising are filled with \"deceptive and unsubstantiated claims.\" In his recent 55-page ruling, Federal Judge John Gleeson (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York), wrote, \"At oral arguments, defendants (Coca-Cola) suggested that no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking vitamin water was a healthy beverage.\" Noting that the soft drink giant wasn't claiming the lawsuit was wrong on factual grounds, the judge wrote that, \"Accordingly, I must accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true.\"\n\nI still can't get over the bizarre audacity of Coke's legal case. Forced to defend themselves in court, they are acknowledging that vitaminwater isn't a healthy product. But they are arguing that advertising it as such isn't false advertising, because no could possibly believe such a ridiculous claim.\n\nI guess that's why they spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising the product, saying it will keep you \"healthy as a horse,\" and will bring about a \"healthy state of physical and mental well-being.\"\n\nWhy do we allow companies like Coca-Cola to tell us that drinking a bottle of sugar water with a few added water-soluble vitamins is a legitimate way to meet our nutritional needs?\n\nHere's what I suggest: If you're looking for a healthy and far less expensive way to hydrate, try drinking water. If you want to flavor the water you drink, try adding the juice of a lemon and a small amount of honey or maple syrup to a quart of water. Another alternative is to mix one part lemonade or fruit juice to three or four parts water. Or drink green tea, hot or chilled, adding lemon and a small amount of sweetener if you like. If you want to jazz it up, try one-half fruit juice, one-half carbonated water.\n\nIf your tap water tastes bad or you suspect it might contain lead or other contaminants, get a water filter that fits under the sink or attaches to the tap.\n\nAnd it's probably not the best idea to rely on a soft drink company for your vitamins and other essential nutrients. A plant-strong diet with lots of vegetables and fruits will provide you with what you need far more reliably, far more consistently -- and far more honestly.\n\nTo learn about inexpensive and healthy foods and beverages, and practical steps you can take toward greater quality of life and economic freedom, read John Robbins' critically acclaimed new book The New Good Life: Living Better Than Ever in an Age of Less.

The Times describes Nabi Saleh as having \u201clong-running disputes with a nearby Israeli settlement, Halamish, that Nabi Saleh residents say has stolen their land and water.\u201d The Times does not note that, as a colony on occupied territory, Halamish is illegal under international law.\n\nThe Newsweek piece says Tamimi \u201chas now been indicted on five counts of assaulting security forces,\u201d and that she is \u201ccharged with interfering with the soldiers\u2019 duties by preventing them from returning to their post.\u201d It notes that \u201cin May, she was charged with interfering with soldiers who were trying to arrest a protester throwing stones,\u201d and refers to her indictment two other times, including in the headline. At no point does the article mention that the proceedings are taking place in a military court. Similarly, an Associated Press (1/9/18) report refers to \u201cIsrael\u2019s hard-charging prosecution\u201d and \u201cthe charges\u201d against Tamimi, without mentioning that she is being tried by the same occupying military that shot her cousin.\n\nOmitting that information makes it sound like Tamimi will receive a fair legal process, but the evidence suggests the opposite. According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are subjected to a military court system that \u201cdoes not grant the right to due process and the rights derived from it,\u201d whereas Israelis illegally colonizing the Occupied Territories have the rights and privileges of a civilian legal system.\n\nIn the military courts, the age of majority is 16, which means that Palestinian teenagers can be tried as adults, while 18 is the age of majority for Israelis. Defence for Children International Palestine (DCIP), a group that has consultative status with the UN, reports that Israeli military court judges, who are either active duty or reserve officers in the Israeli military, \u201crarely exclude evidence obtained by coercion or torture, including confessions drafted in Hebrew, a language most Palestinian children do not understand.\u201d The Israeli military courts\u2019 conviction rate of greater than 99 percent underscores how stacked they are against Palestinians.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 framing of Tamimi\u2019s story suggests that the case\u2019s central issue is whether Palestinians or Israelis would have been better off if the soldier had reacted more violently to being slapped. The Times\u2019 David Halbfinger says\n\nThe paper even implied that Palestinians may be happy that Tamimi was arrested, writing that \u201cthe scene of the young woman being hauled away may have given Palestinians the clear-cut propaganda coup they had been denied by the original confrontation.\u201d\n\nCNN similarly trivialized Tamimi\u2019s arrest, noting that Israelis call her \u201cShirley Temper\u201d because of \u201cher long ginger curls\u201d and because they accuse her of \u201cstarring in carefully choreographed \u2018Pallywood\u2019 videos, a dismissive characterization of protests considered staged for the camera.\u201d\n\nWhile the Times and CNN provide a forum for speculation about whether Palestinians want their own children to suffer because it makes for good public relations, there is much this framing overlooks. For example, none of the above-mentioned articles mention the risk of Tamimi being seriously harmed in Israeli jails. Yet UNICEF charges Israel with subjecting Palestinian youth to \u201cpractices that amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture.\u201d These include children \u201cbeing aggressively awakened in the middle of the night by many armed soldiers and being forcibly brought to an interrogation center tied and blindfolded, sleep-deprived,\u201d and \u201cthreatened with death, physical violence, solitary confinement and sexual assault, against themselves or a family member.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s well-documented mistreatment of Palestinian youth is ignored in these reports, which suggests it is not Palestinian parents but Western reporters who are interested in crafting a public relations spectacle."}, "http://www.epi.org/publication/epidemic-wage-theft-costing-workers-hundreds/": {"title": "An Epidemic of Wage Theft Is Costing Workers Hundreds of Millions of Dollars a Year", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.epi.org/publication/epidemic-wage-theft-costing-workers-hundreds/", "text": "Millions of Americans struggle to get by on low wages, often without any benefits such as paid sick leave, a pension, or even health insurance. Their difficult lives are made immeasurably harder when they do the work they have been hired to do, but their employers refuse to pay, pay for some hours but not others, or fail to pay overtime premiums when employees\u2019 hours exceed 40 in a week.\n\nThis failure to pay what workers are legally entitled to can be called wage theft; in essence, it involves employers taking money that belongs to their employees and keeping it for themselves. Amounts that seem small, such as not paying for time spent preparing a work station at the start of a shift, or for cleaning up and closing up at the end of a shift, can add up. When a worker earns only a minimum wage ($290 for a 40-hour week), shaving a mere half hour a day from the paycheck means a loss of more than $1,400 a year, including overtime premiums. That could be nearly 10 percent of a minimum-wage employee\u2019s annual earnings\u2014the difference between paying the rent and utilities or risking eviction and the loss of gas, water, or electric service.\n\nSurvey evidence suggests that wage theft is widespread and costs workers billions of dollars a year, a transfer from low-income employees to business owners that worsens income inequality, hurts workers and their families, and damages the sense of fairness and justice that a democracy needs to survive. A three-city study of workers in low-wage industries found that in any given week, two-thirds experienced at least one pay-related violation. The researchers estimated that the average loss per worker over the course of a year was $2,634, out of total earnings of $17,616. The total annual wage theft from front-line workers in low-wage industries in the three cities approached $3 billion. If these findings in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles are generalizable to the rest of the U.S. low-wage workforce of 30 million, wage theft is costing workers more than $50 billion a year.\n\nIt is useful to compare the cost of these wage and hour violations with crimes that are better recognized and greatly more feared, though they are much smaller in their overall dollar impact. All of the robberies, burglaries, larcenies, and motor vehicle thefts in the nation cost their victims less than $14 billion in 2012, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reports. That is well over one-third of the estimated cost of wage theft nationwide.\n\nLooking in more detail, in the United States in 2012, there were 292,074 robberies of all kinds, including bank robberies, residential robberies, convenience store and gas station robberies, and street robberies. The total value of the property taken in those crimes was $340,850,358. Those are not the robberies that were solved; those are all the robberies that were reported to the police, anywhere in the nation.\n\nNo one knows precisely how many instances of wage theft occurred in the U.S. during 2012, nor do we know what the victims suffered in total dollars earned but not paid. But we do know that the total amount of money recovered for the victims of wage theft who retained private lawyers or complained to federal or state agencies was at least $933 million\u2014almost three times greater than all the money stolen in robberies that year.\n\nWe know this because EPI canvassed the state labor departments and attorneys general, consulted the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s annual budget, and relied on research for NERA Economic Consulting by Denise Martin, Stephanie Plancich, and Janeen McIntosh on civil litigation settlements. Here\u2019s what we found:\n\nWe have not been able to determine how much more was recovered for wage theft victims by six state departments of labor (Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Indiana, Louisiana, and Vermont) and five attorneys general (Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Oklahoma), so the 2012 total is greater than $933 million.\n\nObviously, the nearly $1 billion collected is only the tip of the wage-theft iceberg, since most victims never sue and never complain to the government. It is notable that the number of Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) cases filed in federal court each year has been rising rapidly, from 5,302 in 2008 to 7,764 in 2013, according to Federal Judicial Caseload Statistics reported by Seyfarth Shaw LLP. The number of case filings is more than five times the number 20 years ago.\n\nCongress must do much more to control this epidemic of wage theft, and could begin by granting President Obama\u2019s request to add 300 investigators to the staff of the Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division. Ultimately, the current staff of 1,100 investigators should be doubled, along with the associated staff in the office of the Solicitor of Labor, which prosecutes the division\u2019s cases. Congress should also finish the work begun in the House of Representatives and enact the various amendments that would prohibit the award of federal contracts to firms convicted of wage and hour violations. Amendments have been added to four fiscal year 2015 appropriations bills, and similar prohibitions should be added to every appropriations bill Congress takes up.\n\nFinally, as we have pointed out in a report for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the penalties under federal law for even willful and repeat violations of the law are minimal. The maximum civil monetary penalty for failure to pay the minimum wage or the required overtime premium is $1,100. For giant corporations such as Wal-Mart and Dollar General, maximum civil money penalties per violation should probably be at least $25,000, while small businesses should be subject to smaller fines\u2014perhaps $5,000 per violation. Clearly, the fines should be sufficient to deter violations and to make it economically unwise to violate the law.\n\nIt is helpful to understand the variety of employer practices that can be considered wage theft and how devastating wage theft can be for workers living from paycheck to paycheck. Following are a just a sample of cases from state prosecutions and settlements finalized in 2012.\n\nIn January 2012, California Attorney General Kamala Harris\u2019s office reached a $1 million settlement with a group of eight car washes run by Dipu Haque Sikder that had routinely committed wage theft.\n\nThe list of violations by these eight businesses was extensive. Workers were required to wait on standby hours before their shifts began in case additional staffing was necessary, with no additional pay. The car washes frequently paid employees subminimum wages, failed to pay for overtime, and did not allow breaks. Those who quit or were fired never received their final wages. Moreover, workers were often unable to cash their paychecks due to insufficient funds in the company bank account.\n\nVeranda, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, reached a settlement in March 2012 with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s office over its illegal theft of wages from 25 employees. The restaurant paid employees less than the minimum wage, failed to compensate them for overtime work, and cheated them out of tips.\n\nTwo Mexican immigrant busboys, Marco Jacal and Isidro Suarez, were paid no wages at all for their work and had to subsist solely on their share of pooled tips. Then, once a manager began to oversee tip distribution, their meager earnings shrank further. After checking with waitresses, they realized the manager was illegally taking a share for himself. At this point, Jacal and Suarez got in touch with an immigrant advocacy group, Make the Road New York, and subsequently the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nAfter he was sued, restaurant owner Moutaz Ali requested the working papers of his employees (as an intimidation tactic) and shortly retaliated against the two known whistleblowers \u2014 first cutting their hours and then firing them. The case settlement required the restaurant to pay restitution of $25,000 to each of the two busboys and $150,000 to the other 23 workers.\n\nBy Kentucky state law, employees must receive a paid 10-minute break for every four hours worked. However, a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Berea, Ky., failed to abide by this. By refusing to pay workers for their break time, the fast-food restaurant was able to keep its employees working later without extra pay. While 10 minutes may seem insignificant, the time\u2014and especially the lost pay, adds up to a meaningful loss of income, especially for low-income workers. Between 2012 and 2013, McDonald\u2019s reached agreement with the Kentucky Labor Cabinet to pay $29,000 in back wages to 203 affected workers.\n\nUnderscoring how widespread the problem of wage theft is, Kentucky Labor Cabinet spokesperson Daniel Lowry reported that the state collected $4.4 million in restitution on wage theft cases in 2013, while comparatively all robberies in the state totaled $2.5 million.\n\nAfter receiving a wage complaint from a worker who failed to receive any money for his work, California Labor Commissioner Julie Su\u2019s office began investigating contractor Tadros & Youssef Construction\u2019s work on the Highland Oaks Elementary School construction project. Su\u2019s office discovered that nine other employees earned below the prevailing wage and were not paid for overtime hours on this same project. The resulting settlement forced Tadros & Youssef to pay $877,876.64 restitution to the 10 workers. The contracting firm is no longer in business.\n\nDuring this project, Tadros & Youssef often hired workers under a promise to pay them by piece rate, i.e., according to the number of units produced. The contracting firm used this method to cheat workers out of their legally required pay without their knowledge. In her remarks on the case, Commissioner Su emphasized the point, \u201cPiece rate payment should never be used as an end-run around minimum wage and prevailing wage laws. Workers are entitled to at least the hourly floor for every hour worked.\u201d\n\nAfter an investigation by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan\u2019s office, Mark Zwirecki, a subcontractor for Classic Gutter Co., was found guilty of 10 counts of forgery in committing wage theft against 10 Polish carpenters working under him on a project to soundproof homes near O\u2019Hare airport.\n\nZwirecki, a subcontractor and foreman for Classic Gutter Co., deposited the money the company gave him to pay his workers directly into his own bank account. He then provided the employees an undisclosed wage far below the prevailing wage they were legally entitled to. According to the attorney general\u2019s office, Zwirecki\u2019s ability to speak Polish to the mostly non-English speaking carpenters aided the scheme, through which he stole $270,753. Zwirecki was sentenced to 12 months of probation and forced to pay a $10,333 fine on top of $60,804 in restitution to the workers.\n\nUnder a 2012 settlement with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s office, Mystique Boutique agreed to pay $925,000 in restitution to workers whom the company had deprived of wages. At the chain of clothing stores, employees often worked 10- and 11-hour days for six days a week with no overtime pay. According to the Retail Action Project, some Mystique workers were making as little as $5.15 per hour and many were immigrants.\n\nTo make matters worse, once the AG\u2019s office began looking into the matter, owner David Cohen tried to forcibly prevent employee cooperation with the investigation. He reportedly threatened several of his workers and even attempted to pay one $50,000 to provide him with the names of employees speaking to investigators.\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office found that Central Mass Disposal, a company handling waste and recyclable collection in eight communities, was paying its employees below the legally required prevailing wage for government contracts from 2008 to 2010. Central Mass Disposal agreed to pay $753,624.45 in restitution to 107 employees along with a $120,000 civil penalty to the commonwealth.\n\nThroughout 2012, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) dealt with repeated wage theft offenses by contractor Affordable Safe and Professional Flagging, LLC. The company routinely paid less than the prevailing wage and failed to pay overtime to employees who conducted traffic control on public construction projects. Over the course of 2012, the company was forced to pay a total of $107,010.24 in back wages. Due to these numerous violations, the Bureau of Labor and Industries disbarred the company in September 2012 for the next five years\u2014preventing it from receiving any state contracts during this period.\n\nAfter its disbarment, the firm was allowed to finish its work on the Portland Reservoir Project (it was grandfathered into this contract). Astoundingly, this led to yet more instances of stolen wages as employees\u2019 paychecks bounced on several occasions and most received no pay for an entire month. In 2013, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries obtained a settlement of $113,000 in back wages for 36 employees.\n\nAfter 95 employees of video game developer Sensory Sweep Studio/Fooptube LLC filed wage claims with the Utah Labor Commission, the case was prosecuted by Attorney General Mark Shurleff\u2019s office. In October 2012, the attorney general achieved the first wage theft criminal conviction in Utah\u2019s history. David Rushton, founder, president, and CEO of the company, received a one-year jail sentence and was ordered to eventually pay at least $1.2 million in back wages to the 95 employees in question.\n\nRushton\u2019s employees frequently received paychecks that bounced because of insufficient funds. Many victims experienced real hardship as a result. Stephen Frost\u2019s first house payment almost fell through because his Sensory paycheck bounced. Eventually, because Frost continuously failed to receive wages he had earned, he and his family were forced to move in with relatives and rent out their house.\n\nBut Rushton didn\u2019t only steal his employees\u2019 wages. He also stole $1 million in employee retirement fund contributions he never deposited. Further, employees\u2019 health insurance was canceled because Rushton failed to keep pace with the company\u2019s insurance bill. As a result, an employee was unable to get proper medication for a child who had recently undergone a heart transplant.\n\nThe Gymboree Corporation agreed to a settlement with Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office in March 2012 regarding its failure to allow store managers to take meal breaks. According to Massachusetts state law, all employees working more than six hours at a time must be afforded at least a 30-minute meal break in which they are relieved of all duties and free to leave the premises. Gymboree paid a total of $130,000 in restitution to all current and former managers working between July 2009 and July 2011. Additionally the company was assessed $360,000 in penalties and agreed to allocate $13,600 to update company policies.\n\nBrady Meixell joined EPI in the summer of 2014.

It describes a dystopian society in a future United Kingdom in which intelligence and merit have become the central tenet of society, replacing previous divisions of social class and creating a society stratified between a merited power holding elite and a disenfranchised underclass of the less merited. The essay satirised the Tripartite System of education that was being practised at the time.[1]\n\nMeritocracy is the political philosophy in which political influence is assigned largely according to the intellectual talent and achievement of the individual. Michael Young coined the term, formed by combining the Latin root \"mere\u014d\" and Ancient Greek suffix \"cracy\", in his essay to describe and ridicule such a society, the selective education system that was the Tripartite System, and the philosophy in general.[1]\n\nThe word was adopted into the English language with none of the negative connotations that Young intended it to have and was embraced by supporters of the philosophy. Young expressed his disappointment in the embrace of this word and philosophy by the Labour Party under Tony Blair in the Guardian in an article in 2001, where he states:\n\nJournalist and writer Paul Barker points out that \u201cirony is a dangerous freight to carry\u201d and suggests that in the 1960s and 70s it was read \u201cas a simple attack on the rampant meritocrats\u201d, whereas he suggests it should be read \u201cas sociological analysis in the form of satire\u201d.[2]"}, "http://www.avclub.com/article/depeche-mode-tells-lifelong-fan-richard-spencer-fu-250908?utm_content=Main&utm_campaign=SF&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=SocialMarketing": {"title": "Depeche Mode tells \u201clifelong fan\u201d Richard Spencer to fuck off", "keywords": ["Music", " Richard Spencer", " Depeche Mode", " Nazi punching", " Newswire", " News"], "url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/depeche-mode-tells-lifelong-fan-richard-spencer-fu-250908?utm_content=Main&utm_campaign=SF&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=SocialMarketing", "text": "Richard Spencer, the Baldur von Schirach of getting clocked in the face, was on the receiving end of yet more humiliation earlier today when he was peacefully cleansed from the Conservative Political Action Conference for being, in the words of its spokesman, \u201crepugnant.\u201d Being deemed too odious for a gathering where Steve Bannon counts as a headliner is embarrassing enough, but\u2014as comeuppance for Spencer and his \u201calt-right\u201d ilk tends to come swiftly and in several rounds these days\u2014the shitting on Spencer didn\u2019t end there.\n\nBefore he was hustled off the premises, Spencer spent some time being pelted with questions by reporters, who were surely hoping the light from their cameras would once again attract someone\u2019s flying fists.

Martin Armstrong pointed this out at his blog, Armstrong Economics, last week.\n\nOfficers can take cash and property from people without convicting or even charging them with a crime \u2014 yes, really! \u2014 through the highly controversial practice known as civil asset forfeiture. Last year, according to the Institute for Justice, the Treasury and Justice departments deposited more than $5 billion into their respective asset forfeiture funds. That same year, the FBI reports that burglary losses topped out at $3.5 billion.\n\nArmstrong claims that \"the police are now taking more assets than the criminals,\" but this isn't exactly right: The FBI also tracks property losses from larceny and theft, in addition to plain ol' burglary. If you add up all the property stolen in 2014, from burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft and other means, you arrive at roughly $12.3 billion, according to the FBI. That's more than double the federal asset forfeiture haul.\n\nOne other point: Those asset forfeiture deposit amounts are not necessarily the best indicator of a rise in the use of forfeiture. \"In a given year, one or two high-dollar cases may produce unusually large amounts of money \u2014 with a portion going back to victims \u2014 thereby telling a noisy story of year-to-year activity levels,\" the Institute for Justice explains. A big chunk of that 2014 deposit, for instance, was the $1.7 billion Bernie Madoff judgment, most of which flowed back to the victims.\n\nFor that reason, the net assets of the funds are usually seen as a more stable indicator \u2014 those numbers show how much money is left over in the funds each year after the federal government takes care of various obligations, like payments to victims. Since this number can reflect monies taken over multiple calendar years, it's less comparable to the annual burglary statistics.\n\nStill, even this more stable indicator hit $4.5 billion in 2014, according to the Institute for Justice \u2014 higher again than the burglary losses that year.\n\nOne final caveat is that these are only the federal totals and don't reflect how much property is seized by state and local police each year. Reliable data for all 50 states is unavailable, but the Institute of Justice found that the total asset forfeiture haul for 14 states topped $250 million in 2013. The grand 50-state total would probably be much higher.\n\nStill, boil down all the numbers and caveats above and you arrive at a simple fact: In the United States, in 2014, more cash and property transferred hands via civil asset forfeiture than via burglary. The total value of asset forfeitures was more than one-third of the total value of property stolen by criminals in 2014. That represents something of a sea change in the way police do business \u2014 and it's prompting plenty of scrutiny of the practice.\n\nThe surprising reason more police dogs are dying in the line of duty\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t realize it\u2019s this easy for police to take your cash\n\nPolice chases kill more people each year than floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and lightning \u2014 combined"}, "https://lawandcrime.com/police/nypd-sex-crimes-lieutenant-indicted-on-over-80-counts-of-child-sexual-abuse/": {"title": "NYPD Sex Crimes Lieutenant Indicted On Over 80 Counts Of Child Sexual Abuse", "keywords": ["law and order", "nicholas mcateer", "nypd", "svu", "t"], "url": "https://lawandcrime.com/police/nypd-sex-crimes-lieutenant-indicted-on-over-80-counts-of-child-sexual-abuse/", "text": "A retired New York City Police Department (\u201cNYPD\u201d) lieutenant has been indicted on a total of 82 counts of child sexual abuse.\n\nNicholas McAteer, who hails from the New York City suburb of Orange County, is accused of a shocking array of child sexual abuse and incest after two victims have come forward to detail years of such allegations.\n\nThe first victim came forward in August and McAteer was then arrested, charged and released on $75,000 bail.\n\nJust recently, a second victim came forward and last week a grand jury indicted McAteer and dozens of additional charges.\n\nA source with the McAteer family told News 12 Westchester that the abuse apparently began when the alleged victims\u2013both of whom were family members but neither of whom are his children\u2013were 12 and 13 years of age.\n\nAccording to that same source, the abuse occurred in a systematic fashion\u2013either while McAteer\u2019s wife was asleep or inside of McAteer\u2019s unmarked NYPD patrol car.\n\nThe sexual crimes\u2013including rape\u2013against McAteer\u2019s minor family members are alleged to have occurred over the course of a decade.

Johnson made a move that was unprecedented at the time and remains unmatched by succeeding administrations. He announced a War on Poverty, saying that its \u201cchief weapons\u201d would be \u201cbetter schools, and better health, and better homes, and better training, and better job opportunities.\u201d So starting in 1964 and for almost a decade, the federal government poured at least some of its resources in the direction they should have been going all along: toward those who were most in need. Longstanding programs like Head Start, Legal Services, and the Job Corps were created. Medicaid was established. Poverty among seniors was significantly reduced by improvements in Social Security. Johnson seemed to have established the principle that it is the responsibility of government to intervene on behalf of the disadvantaged and deprived. But there was never enough money for the fight against poverty, and Johnson found himself increasingly distracted by another and deadlier war\u2014the one in Vietnam. Although underfunded, the War on Poverty still managed to provoke an intense backlash from conservative intellectuals and politicians. The original welfare reform bill\u2014a bill, it should be recalled, which was signed by President Bill Clinton\u2014included an allocation of $100 million for \"chastity training\" for low-income women. In their view, government programs could do nothing to help the poor because poverty arises from the twisted psychology of the poor themselves. By the Reagan era, it had become a cornerstone of conservative ideology that poverty is caused not by low wages or a lack of jobs and education, but by the bad attitudes and faulty lifestyles of the poor. Picking up on this theory, pundits and politicians have bemoaned the character failings and bad habits of the poor for at least the past 50 years. In their view, the poor are shiftless, irresponsible, and prone to addiction. They have too many children and fail to get married. So if they suffer from grievous material deprivation, if they run out of money between paychecks, if they do not always have food on their tables\u2014then they have no one to blame but themselves.\n\nIn the 1990s, with a bipartisan attack on welfare, this kind of prejudice against the poor took a drastically misogynistic turn. Poor single mothers were identified as a key link in what was called \u201cthe cycle of poverty.\u201d By staying at home and collecting welfare, they set a toxic example for their children, who\u2014important policymakers came to believe\u2014would be better off being cared for by paid child care workers or even, as Newt Gingrich proposed, in orphanages. Welfare \u201creform\u201d was the answer, and it was intended not only to end financial support for imperiled families, but also to cure the self-induced \u201cculture of poverty\u201d that was supposedly at the root of their misery. The original welfare reform bill\u2014a bill, it should be recalled, which was signed by President Bill Clinton\u2014included an allocation of $100 million for \u201cchastity training\u201d for low-income women. A series from The Atlantic and The Shriver Report Read More The Great Recession should have put the victim-blaming theory of poverty to rest. In the space of only a few months, millions of people entered the ranks of the officially poor\u2014not only laid-off blue-collar workers, but also downsized tech workers, managers, lawyers, and other once-comfortable professionals. No one could accuse these \u201cnouveau poor\u201d Americans of having made bad choices or bad lifestyle decisions. They were educated, hardworking, and ambitious, and now they were also poor\u2014applying for food stamps, showing up in shelters, lining up for entry-level jobs in retail. This would have been the moment for the pundits to finally admit the truth: Poverty is not a character failing or a lack of motivation. Poverty is a shortage of money.\n\nFor most women in poverty, in both good times and bad, the shortage of money arises largely from inadequate wages. When I worked on my book, Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, I took jobs as a waitress, nursing-home aide, hotel housekeeper, Wal-Mart associate, and a maid with a house-cleaning service. I did not choose these jobs because they were low-paying. I chose them because these are the entry-level jobs most readily available to women. What I discovered is that in many ways, these jobs are a trap: They pay so little that you cannot accumulate even a couple of hundred dollars to help you make the transition to a better-paying job. They often give you no control over your work schedule, making it impossible to arrange for child care or take a second job. And in many of these jobs, even young women soon begin to experience the physical deterioration\u2014especially knee and back problems\u2014that can bring a painful end to their work life. I was also dismayed to find that in some ways, it is actually more expensive to be poor than not poor. If you can\u2019t afford the first month\u2019s rent and security deposit you need in order to rent an apartment, you may get stuck in an overpriced residential motel. If you don\u2019t have a kitchen or even a refrigerator and microwave, you will find yourself falling back on convenience store food, which\u2014in addition to its nutritional deficits\u2014is also alarmingly overpriced. If you need a loan, as most poor people eventually do, you will end up paying an interest rate many times more than what a more affluent borrower would be charged. To be poor\u2014especially with children to support and care for\u2014is a perpetual high-wire act. The criminalization of poverty has accelerated since the recession. Most private-sector employers offer no sick days, and many will fire a person who misses a day of work, even to stay home with a sick child. A nonfunctioning car can also mean lost pay and sudden expenses. A broken headlight invites a ticket, plus a fine greater than the cost of a new headlight, and possible court costs. If a creditor decides to get nasty, a court summons may be issued, often leading to an arrest warrant. No amount of training in financial literacy can prepare someone for such exigencies\u2014or make up for an income that is impossibly low to start with. Instead of treating low-wage mothers as the struggling heroines they are, our political culture still tends to view them as miscreants and contributors to the \u201ccycle of poverty.\u201d If anything, the criminalization of poverty has accelerated since the recession, with growing numbers of states drug testing applicants for temporary assistance, imposing steep fines for school truancy, and imprisoning people for debt. Such measures constitute a cruel inversion of the Johnson-era principle that it is the responsibility of government to extend a helping hand to the poor. Sadly, this has become the means by which the wealthiest country in the world manages to remain complacent in the face of alarmingly high levels of poverty: by continuing to blame poverty not on the economy or inadequate social supports, but on the poor themselves. It\u2019s time to revive the notion of a collective national responsibility to the poorest among us, who are disproportionately women and especially women of color. Until that happens, we need to wake up to the fact that the underpaid women who clean our homes and offices, prepare and serve our meals, and care for our elderly\u2014earning wages that do not provide enough to live on\u2014are the true philanthropists of our society."}, "https://www.gofundme.com/welcomehomechelsea": {"title": "Click here to support Chelsea Manning Welcome Home Fund organized by Chase Strangio", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.gofundme.com/welcomehomechelsea", "text": ": This is the official campaign raising funds for Chelsea Manning.

Support us in this fight: make a tax-deductible donation today by clicking here.\n\n(Photo: Pete Souza / White House)Mike Stivers for Truthout: Anyone following issues of civil liberties under Obama knows that his administration's policies have been disastrous. The signing of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which effectively legalizes indefinite detention of US citizens, the prosecution of more whistleblowers than any previous president, the refusal to close Guantanamo, and the adoption of ruthless positions in trials such as Hedges vs. Obama and Holder vs. Humanitarian Law Project don't even encapsulate the full extent of the flagrant violations of civil, political and constitutional rights. One basic question that a lot of people seem to be asking is, why? What's the rationale?\n\nNoam Chomsky: That's a very interesting question. I personally never expected anything of Obama, and wrote about it before the 2008 primaries. I thought it was smoke and mirrors. The one thing that did surprise me is his attack on civil liberties. They go well beyond anything I would have anticipated, and they don't seem easy to explain. In many ways the worst is what you mention, Holder vs. Humanitarian Law Project. That's an Obama initiative and it's a very serious attack on civil liberties. He doesn't gain anything from it \u2013 he doesn't get any political mileage out of it. In fact, most people don't even know about it, but what it does is extend the concept of \"material assistance to terror\" to speech.\n\nThe case in question was a law group that was giving legal advice to groups on the terrorist list, which in itself has no moral or legal justification; it's an abomination. But if you look at the way it's been used, it becomes even more abhorrent (Nelson Mandela was on it until a couple of years ago.) And the wording of the colloquy is broad enough that it could very well mean that if, say, you meet with someone in a terrorist group and advise them to turn to nonviolent means, then that's material assistance to terrorism. I've met with people who are on the list and will continue to do so, and Obama wants to criminalize that, which is a plain attack on freedom of speech. I just don't understand why he's doing it.\n\nThe NDAA suit, of which I'm a plaintiff - it mostly codifies existing practice. While there has been some protest over the indefinite detention clause, there's one aspect of it that I'm not entirely happy with. The only protest that's being raised is in response to detention of American citizens, but I don't see why we should have the right to detain anyone without trial. The provision of the NDAA that allows for this should not be tolerated. It was banned almost eight centuries ago in the Magna Carta.\n\n\n\nIt's the same with the drone killings. There was some protest over the Anwar Al-Awlaki killing because he was an American citizen. But what about someone who isn't an American citizen? Do we have a right to murder them if the president feels like it?\n\nOn Obama's 2012 election campaign web site, it clearly states that Obama has prosecuted six whistleblowers under the Espionage Act. Does he think he's appealing to some constituency with that affirmation?\n\nI don't know what base he's appealing to. If he thinks he's appealing to the nationalist base, well, they're not going to vote for him anyway. That's why I don't understand it. I don't think he's doing anything besides alienating his own natural base. So it's something else.\n\nWhat it is is the same kind of commitment to expanding executive power that Cheney and Rumsfeld had. He kind of puts it in mellifluous terms and there's a little difference in his tone. It's not as crude and brutal as they were, but it's pretty hard to see much of a difference.\n\nIt also extends to other developments, most of which we don't really know about, like the surveillance state that's being built and the capacity to pick up electronic communication. It's an enormous attack on personal space and privacy. There's essentially nothing left. And that will get worse with the new drone technologies that are being developed and given to local police forces.\n\nThat expansion of the surveillance state, do you see that as another facet of expanding executive power?\n\nIt's an enormous expansion of executive power. I doubt that they can do much with this information that's being stored. I've had plenty of experience with the FBI in simpler years when they didn't have all this stuff. But they had tons of information. They were just drowning in it and didn't know how to use it. It's sort of like walking into the New York Public Library and saying \"I want to be a chemist.\" You've got all the information there, but it's not doing any good.\n\nMight that change with enhanced technology and search capabilities?\n\nThere will be new ways of combing through the data electronically to pick up things that look like suspicious connections, almost all of which will mean nothing, but they may find some things. It's kind of like the drone killings. You have what's called \"intelligence.\" Sometimes it means something; other times it means nothing. It also means that if you have suspicions of somebody for some reason, whatever it is, you can go in there and find all sorts of incriminating stuff. It may not be legally incriminating, but it will be used to intimidate people - threatening to publicize things people meant to be private.\n\nDo you think nonviolent, verbal dissent could eventually be criminalized?\n\nIt could be criminalized. Anybody who has looked at law enforcement at all knows that one of the techniques is to try to force confession or plea-bargaining by just using material that the person doesn't want publicized. That's very common. You can threaten to expose something even if it didn't happen, or it's just a rumor. That's a powerful weapon to get people to cooperate or submit, and I suspect we're going to see a lot of that. We already do see a lot of it in the criminal courts. Most cases don't come to trial. They're settled. And a lot of them are settled in this way.\n\nThere's an alarming quote from Chris Hedges in reference to the NDAA suit. He said, \"If we lose [the suit], the power of the military to detain citizens, strip them of due process and hold them indefinitely in military prisons will become a terrifying reality.\" How much weight does this case hold?\n\nWe've already lost that right. If you look at the criminal systems and the truly oppressed populations, like the black male population, for them, due process is sometimes existent, but overwhelmingly they just don't have it. You can't hire a lawyer; you don't get a decent defense and you don't have resources. That's how the prisons are filled.\n\nDo you think the left in general could become another oppressed population in the future?\n\nI don't think there's much of a threat there. I doubt that there'll be anything like what there was in the 60s. We're nowhere near the days of COINTELPRO. That was the FBI, and it was pretty harsh. It went as far as political assassinations. Again, the worst of which was directed towards blacks. It's harder to attack privileged whites.\n\nIt's the same with the drug wars. The police can go to downtown Harlem and pick up a kid with a joint in the streets. But they can't go into the elegant apartments and get a stockbroker who's sniffing cocaine.\n\nYou can see the same with incarceration rates, which are increasing outrageously. That all started with Reagan. He started a race war. There's a great book by Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow. She points out, and she's quite right, that it's very analogous to what happened after reconstruction when slavery was technically eliminated, but it just turned into criminalization of black life. You ended up with a large part of the black, mostly male population in jail, and they become slave labor. This runs deep in American history. It's not going to be easy to extricate. Privileged whites on the left will never be subject to this, though. They have too much political power.\n\nHow do the military-industrial complex and market forces in general perpetuate these systems of injustice?\n\nVery much so. Just look at the incarceration rates now. They're driven by privatized prison systems. The development of the surveillance technology like drones is also highly commercialized by now. The state commercializes a lot of this activity, like the military does. I'm sure there were more contractors in Iraq than soldiers.\n\nIs there any way that political economic reform - like, say, overturning Citizens United - might rein in these industrial complexes?\n\nWell, I don't think Citizens United is likely to be overturned, and it is, of course, a rotten decision, but it does have some justifications. And there are some civil libertarians like Glenn Greenwald who more or less supported it on free speech grounds. I don't agree with it, but I can see the argument.\n\nOn the other hand, things like detention without trial, well, that strikes right at the heart of Anglo American law dating back to the 13th century. That's the main part of the Charter of Liberties, the core of the Magna. Now that had a narrow scope; it was mostly limited to free men.\n\nIt's interesting to see the way in which due process is being reinterpreted by Obama's Justice Department in regards to the drone killings. Attorney General Eric Holder was asked why the administration was killing people without due process. Well, there was due process, he said, because they discuss it within the executive branch. King John in the 13th century would have loved that.\n\nIn two years, we're going to get to the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, and it'll be a funeral. Not just this, but every other aspect. Take rendition, for example. One of the provisions of Magna Carta is that you can't send someone across the seas for punishment. Much of the world participates in rendition now.\n\nIs there potential for legal redress in cases like Hedges vs. Obama? How viable is that strategy?\n\nWell, I was asked by Chris Hedges to participate and I'm one of the plaintiffs. I think it's a viable strategy. But NDAA is not the worst of it by far. Holder vs. Humanitarian Law is certainly worse. Legal strategies are certainly worth pursuing, and they can achieve results. Our system of law is flawed. But it's still a system of law. It's not Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere has been considerable outrage towards the Bradley Manning case - what do you make of the campaign to support him?\n\nBradley Manning is another case of radical violation of the Magna Carta. Here's a guy, an American citizen. He's been held in prison without trial for about a year and a half, a large part of it in solitary confinement, which is torture, and he's never going to get a civil trial. It'll be a military trial if he even gets one.\n\nIt's pretty remarkable to see that things like this are acceptable and not even worthy of comment. And Bradley Manning isn't even the worst case. Take, say, the first Guantanamo prisoner who went to what's called \"trial\" under Obama. Omar Khadr, his name is. Take a look at his history. He's a 15-year-old boy in his village in Afghanistan. Soldiers invade the village, so he shoots at them, trying to defend it. That makes him a terrorist. So he was sent to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, which is worse than Guantanamo. There's no Red Cross, no supervision, no nothing. He was there for a couple of years, and then sent to Guantanamo for another couple of years. Finally there came a chance to have a hearing before a military tribunal. This is mostly under Obama, for the record. His lawyers were told, You have two choices: You can plead guilty and you get another eight years in Guantanamo. Or you can plead innocent, in which case, you're here forever. So those are the choices his lawyers were given, practically in those words. So they told him to plead guilty. He's actually a Canadian citizen, and though they could have gotten him out anytime they wanted, Canada finally had the courage to step on the master's toes and asked for him to be released, though he remains imprisoned.\n\nThe point of this is that we accept it. There's virtually no protest over the fact that a 15-year-old child is treated this way.\n\nIs it possible that we might see a revival of the global justice movement of the 1980s to launch large-scale movements against these practices and policies?\n\nThere is a global justice movement, and it does important work. But it doesn't conform to the prevailing doctrinal system of the powerful, so it doesn't make it into the public view. There was an interesting report published recently by the Open Society Institute, \"Globalizing Torture.\" There were some very interesting aspects to that. It wasn't commented on much, but Latin American analyst Greg Grandin at New York University wrote a comment on it that was very important. He said that if you look at the map of countries that participated in the US torture practices - which remember, is a violation of Magna Carta - most of the world participated. Most of Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. But there was one striking omission: Latin America. There wasn't a single Latin American country that participated. Which is striking because Latin America used to be under the thumb of the United States. They did what we wanted or else we would overthrow their governments. Furthermore, during that whole period, Latin America was one of the world centers of torture. But now they've liberated themselves enough, so they're the one area of the world that didn't participate. That helps explain the passionate hatred of Chavez and Morales and others who have taken Latin America out of the US's reach. Those are very important changes. It shows that things can be done.\n\nIn your time as an activist and writer, do you see states on a trajectory toward more openness, transparency and accountability, obviously with movements pushing that, or do you see them as more opaque, unaccountable and exclusive?\n\nThese things are always going on in parallel. In many respects it's more open and transparent. But there's a backlash to try to restore obedience, passivity and power structures. That struggle has gone on throughout history. Over hundreds of years, they do move toward openness, freedom and justice. Like Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice. It's very slow, and it often bends backwards and that's true of basically any movement you can think of. Civil rights, women's rights, freedom of expression, etcetera. And we should remember that, in a lot of these movements, the United States has been a global leader. Freedom of speech is protected in the US beyond any country I know - certainly more than the European countries in all sorts of ways. And it's not in the Bill of Rights, incidentally. It comes mostly from Supreme Court Cases of the 1960s, some of them in the context of the civil rights movement. That's what large-scale popular movements do. They push things forward.\n\nDo you see potential for a movement like that in response to recent policy and practice in regards to surveillance?\n\nThere should be. Nobody could have predicted what happened in the 60s. In the 50s, things were totally dead. I lived through it, so I know. There was very little activism going on. Then, all of a sudden, things started to happen. Unpredictably. A couple of black kids sat in at a lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. It could have ended there. Cops could have come and thrown the kids in jail and it would have been over. But it grew into a huge popular movement. That could happen again."}, "https://warisboring.com/anarchists-are-killing-neo-nazis-in-greece-baca262397da#.bf2igwkue": {"title": "From drones to AKs, high technology to low politics.", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://warisboring.com/anarchists-are-killing-neo-nazis-in-greece-baca262397da#.bf2igwkue", "text": "The conflict in Bosnia was more than a civil war.

His crime? Being a journalist.\n\nShaye's story has received some attention thanks to the excellent reporting of independent journalist Jeremy Scahill, but chances are most Americans have never heard of him due to a virtual blackout of coverage in the mainstream media. This despite the fact that the U.S. government--and President Obama in particular--are directly responsible for keeping him locked up.\n\nShaye is one of Yemen's most respected journalists. He gained international attention in recent years for his investigations into al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and he was also the last journalist to interview radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki before Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike.\n\nAlthough he used connections to interview al-Qaeda and other extremist leaders, he was no sympathizer. His interviews were hardly uncritical, and he regularly posed hard-hitting questions that gained him the admiration of even staunch supporters of the U.S. war on terror.\n\n\"It is difficult to overestimate the importance of his work,\" Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen scholar at Princeton University who had communicated regularly with Shaye since 2008, told Scahill. \"Without Shaye's reports and interviews, we would know much less about al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula than we do, and if one believes, as I do, that knowledge of the enemy is important to constructing a strategy to defeat them, then his arrest and continued detention has left a hole in our knowledge that has yet to be filled.\"\n\nPrior to 2009, Shaye regularly appeared in the international media as an expert on al-Qaeda in the Gulf region. In fact, it was not this reporting that brought him under fire from the Yemeni and U.S. governments, despite later claims.\n\nOn December 17, 2009, the Yemeni government announced that it had conducted a series of air strikes against an al-Qaeda training camp in the village of al Majala in the Abyan province in the south of the country. Shaye traveled to Majala in the aftermath to investigate. He found that there was no training camp, just a village, and that the victims of the attack were overwhelmingly civilians, including 14 women and 21 children.\n\nMoreover, Shaye discovered remnants of Tomahawk missiles and cluster bombs--which are not part of the Yemeni government's arsenal--stamped with the words \"Made in the USA.\" He circulated pictures of these in the international media. While at the time the U.S. government refused to confirm its involvement in the attacks, later diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks confirmed it.\n\nIn one leaked cable, Ali Abdullah Saleh, then president of Yemen, assured then-head of U.S. Central Command General David Petraeus: \"\"We'll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours.\"\n\nSEVEN MONTHS later, Shaye was abducted by Yemeni intelligence officials, beaten and interrogated regarding his reporting on U.S. involvement in Majala. \"We will destroy your life if you keep on talking about this issue,\" one of the interrogators told him.\n\nShaye responded by going directly to Al-Jazeera to describe his kidnapping. \"Abdulelah continued to report facts, not for the sake of the Americans or al-Qaeda, but because he believed that what he was reporting was the truth and that it is a journalist's role to uncover the truth,\" Shaye's best friend, Yemeni political cartoonist Kamal Sharaf, told Scahill.\n\nOne month later, Shaye was arrested and held in solitary confinement for 34 days with no contact with the outside world.\n\nWhen Shaye's lawyer, Abdulrahman Barman, was finally able to visit him, he noticed \"that one of Abdulelah's teeth was extracted and another one was broken, in addition to the presence of some scars on his chest. There were a lot scars on his chest. He was psychologically tortured. He had been told that all his friends and family members had left him and that no one had raised his case. He was tortured by false information.\"\n\nIn October 2010, Shaye was hauled into Yemen's state security court--a kangaroo court established by presidential decree--in a cage. The multiple charges leveled against him included joining, recruiting and serving as a propagandist for al-Qaeda as well as inciting members to assassinate President Saleh and his son.\n\nShaye refused to respond to these charges for which no evidence was offered and instead turned the tables on the court in his statement. As Scahill reports:\n\nAs security guards dragged him away, Shaye yelled, \"Yemen, this is a place where, when a young journalist becomes successful, he is viewed with suspicion.\"\n\nIN JANUARY 2011, the court, which, according to Human Rights Watch, \"failed to meet international standards of due process,\" convicted Shaye on terrorism-related charges and sentenced him to five years in prison.\n\nHis imprisonment caused a huge public outcry, and local activists and journalists, including some prominent tribal leaders, began petitioning for his release. A month later, it seemed as though they would be successful when President Saleh agreed to issue a pardon. Yet when news of it leaked to the press--mere hours before the paperwork was to be signed--Saleh suddenly received a personal phone call from Obama.\n\nAccording to the White House summary of the call, Obama \"expressed concern over the release of Abd-Ilah al-Shai, who had been sentenced to five years in prison for his association with AQAP.\" Saleh immediately scrapped the pardon.\n\nAfter continued public outcry, Yemen's new president, Abdo Rabbo Mansour, agreed to release Shaye on July 23 of this year, though he is to continue serving out the rest of his sentence under house arrest.\n\nWhile Shaye's release is certainly a cause for celebration, we should not allow his story to be buried. As the witch hunts against whistle-blowers Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden drag on, Shaye's story is yet another chilling example of the lengths to which our government will go to suppress the truth about its murderous policies, including the targeting of journalists. We must raise our voices in support of Shaye and all those who bravely speak out against the U.S. war on truth."}, "http://abc7chicago.com/students-bullied-girl-killed-after-pepper-spraying-attackers-at-dunkin-donuts/2929436/": {"title": "Students: Bullied girl killed after pepper-spraying attackers at Dunkin Donuts", "keywords": ["new rochelle", "westchester county", "dunkin donuts stabbing", "dunkin' donuts", "teen stabbed", "valaree schwach", "stabbing", "dunkin donuts", "bullying", "us world", "new york", "united states"], "url": "http://abc7chicago.com/students-bullied-girl-killed-after-pepper-spraying-attackers-at-dunkin-donuts/2929436/", "text": "The suspect wanted in a deadly stabbing of a teenager inside a Dunkin' Donuts in Westchester County, N.Y., surrendered to police Thursday after authorities publicly identified her.Z'Inah Brown, 16, turned herself in to New Rochelle police and was booked for second-degree murder in the death of 16-year-old Valeree Megan Schwab.

She picked it up and began to read, \u201cWho among us has any conception of the dimensions of shame that will befall us and our children when one day the veil has fallen from our eyes and the most horrible crimes \u2014 crimes that infinitely outdistance every human measure \u2014 reach light of day?\u201d\n\nThe mass deportation of Jews to concentration camps was now fully underway. As a child, Sophie had been a member of the girl\u2019s branch of the Hitler Youth, but had been troubled when her Jewish friend was prohibited from joining. As Jud Newborn and Annette Dumbach explained in their book, Sophie Scholl and the White Rose, Sophie and her siblings \u2014 still under the sway of the Hitler Youth \u2014 often clashed with their father, an avowed anti-Nazi. One evening, walking along the Danube, he had turned to his children suddenly and hissed, \u201cAll I want is for you to walk straight and free through life, even when it\u2019s hard.\u201d Slowly, skepticism wormed its way in. Her alienation reached fever pitch in high school as nearly everything she learned was steeped in Nazi propaganda. Then her father was arrested when his employer overheard him calling Hitler \u201cthe scourge of humanity.\u201d But reading the pamphlet, Sophie was conflicted. She had two brothers at the front, her father was in jail awaiting sentencing, and her mother was ill. Waiting to report anti-Nazi literature was a crime. She walked out of the lecture hall with the pamphlet in hand.\n\nSophie went in search of her older brother Hans, who was a medical student also at the University of Munich. He wasn\u2019t in his apartment, so she waited for him there. She found a book by the German poet, Friedrich Schiller on his desk and began reading. One page in particular was covered in marks. The exact words she had read in the pamphlet were underlined. Sophie was terrified. Her brother must have had something to do with the pamphlet. When he returned, Sophie confronted him. He demurred. Two of his friends arrived, and eventually they told her the truth. Her brother and four others were a part of an anonymous resistance campaign. Sophie decided to join them.\n\nFor the next month, the group worked on their campaign. They bought stamps and paper from different post offices to avoid arousing suspicion. They collected quotes and copied them with a mimeograph. The second pamphlet read, \u201cSince the conquest of Poland 300,000 Jews have been murdered, a crime against human dignity.\u201d The third called for the sabotage of armament plants, newspapers, and public ceremonies, and the awakening of the \u201clower classes.\u201d Rumors buzzed about the pamphlets. As the language of the pamphlets became increasingly explicit, the gestapo ramped up their efforts to find the perpetrators, arresting anyone at the slightest suspicion of collaboration.\n\nIn July, four members of the White Rose including Hans were ordered to spend their summer break working as medics at the Russian front. On their way, they passed the Warsaw ghetto and were horrified. Once in Russia, they understood that Germany was losing to the Soviets despite the fact that the Nazis claimed otherwise. When they returned home in November, they were emboldened, and the White Rose increased the number of pamphlets they were publishing. The group traveled by train to distribute the leaflets all over Germany. They wanted to create the impression that the White Rose was a vast network, that the public was behind them. When the Germans admitted their loss to the Soviets in February of 1943, some White Rose members went out at night and graffitied the words \u201cFreedom,\u201d \u201cDown with Hitler\u201d and \u201cHitler mass murder\u201d on the city hall and other public places. They believed Nazi Germany might be crumbling, they just needed the people to realize it."}, "https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-clashes-break-alt-right-milo/": {"title": "Berkeley: Clashes Break Out Against Alt-Right and Milo", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-clashes-break-alt-right-milo/", "text": "It\u2019s Going Down is a digital community center from anarchist, anti-fascist, autonomous anti-capitalist and anti-colonial movements.

Basic models of these laser-guided firecrackers use shaped-charge HEAT ( high-explosive anti-tank ) warheads but upgraded models include blast fragmentation sleeves for bulk-murder & thermobaric warheads that suck the air out of Afghan caves & can even collapse buildings.

To understand what a drone strike is, try to imagine the missiles as metal bags stuffed with the taxes of 163 workers being launched at a mosque in Pakistan.

In addition, the company found that U.S. flag exports to Vietnam during the late 1960s and early 1970s resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, a clear sign that there was something seriously wrong with its product.\n\nDespite fears about the flag's safety\u2014especially when improperly used or manipulated in ways not originally intended\u2014sales continued unabated over the years, potentially putting billions of unsuspecting people in danger.\n\n\"At first, we wanted one of our flags in every home in America,\" Burman said. \"Unfortunately, the practical applications of this product are far outnumbered by the risks it presents. Millions have died needlessly, and when you ask people why, they point to the flag.\"\n\nAdded Burman, \"Frankly, we should have pulled it off the market decades ago.\"\n\nStudies conducted by the Annin & Company research and development department revealed that faulty U.S. flags have caused more than just injuries and deaths.

But the county attorney informed me that I had to sign the contract because the board had passed it. The only way to cancel it was by board action.\n\n\u201cOnce I signed it, what I have been doing is working with the County manager and Commissioner (Bob) Ott \u2026 to look for ways that we can use the existing contract to review current routes to make them more efficient and to have the study done cheapest. We are still in the early stages of that.\n\n\u201cRegardless, the study is needed. It was a major issue during the town halls, and I tried to find a way to respond to those concerns. But I, as Chairman, do not have the authority to abrogate a contract approved by the Board. Moreover, there was not unanimity in my desire to cancel the contract.\n\n\u201cIn short, any effort to cancel the contract would have brought problems of their own, and I decided to move on and make the best of what we had.\u201d\n\nBoyce ends his email by saying transit will undoubtedly be a major topic at the board retreat later this month."}, "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42745853": {"title": "'World's richest 1% get 82% of the wealth'", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42745853", "text": "The gap between the super rich and the rest of the world widened last year as wealth continued to be owned by a small minority, Oxfam has claimed.\n\nSome 82% of money generated last year went to the richest 1% of the global population while the poorest half saw no increase at all, the charity said.\n\nOxfam said its figures - which critics have queried - showed a failing system.\n\nIt blamed tax evasion, firms' influence on policy, erosion of workers' rights, and cost cutting for the widening gap.\n\nOxfam has produced similar reports for the past five years. In 2017 it calculated that the world's eight richest individuals had as much wealth as the poorest half of the world.\n\nThis year, it said 42 people now had as much wealth as the poorest half, but it revised last year's figure to 61. Oxfam said the revision was due to improved data and said the trend of \"widening inequality\" remained.\n\nOxfam chief executive Mark Goldring said its constant readjustment of the figures reflected the fact that the report was based \"on the best data available at the time\".\n\n\"However you look at it, this is an unacceptable level of inequality,\" he said.\n\nOxfam's report coincides with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, a Swiss ski resort. The annual conference attracts many of the world's top political and business leaders.\n\nInequality typically features high on the agenda, but Mr Goldring said that too often \"tough talk fades away at the first resistance\".\n\nIt's really hard working out how much wealth the super-rich and the very poor have.\n\nThe super-rich tend not to publicise their worth and many of the world's poorest countries keep poor statistics.\n\nTo illustrate that, this time last year, Oxfam told us that eight individuals have as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population. Now it has revised that figure to 61 people for last year, falling to 42 people this year - that's a pretty big revision.\n\nAnd there are other caveats around the data on which all this is based, such as that the people on the list with the lowest wealth are not necessarily poor at all - they may be highly qualified professionals with large amounts of student debt, for example, or people with high incomes but enormous mortgages.\n\nBut whether it's eight people, 42 people or 61 people who have the same wealth as half of the world, there is still great wealth inequality around the world, which is the message Oxfam is taking to Davos.\n\nThe charity is urging a rethink of business models, arguing their focus on maximising shareholder returns over broader social impact is wrong.\n\nIt said there was \"huge support\" for action with two thirds (72%) of 70,000 people it surveyed in ten countries saying they wanted their governments to \"urgently address the income gap between rich and poor\".\n\nBut Mark Littlewood, director general at free market think tank The Institute of Economic Affairs, said Oxfam was becoming \"obsessed with the rich rather than the poor\".\n\n\"Higher taxes and redistribution will do nothing to help the poor; wealth is not a fixed pie. Richer people are also highly taxed people - reducing their wealth won't lead to redistribution, it will destroy it to the benefit of no one,\" he added.\n\nIt was a criticism echoed by Sam Dumitriu, head of research at another free market think tank - the Adam Smith Institute - who said the charity's inequality stats \"always paint the wrong picture\".\n\n\"In reality, global inequality has fallen massively over the past few decades.\n\n\"As China, India and Vietnam embraced neoliberal reforms that enforce property rights, reduce regulations and increase competition, the world's poorest have received a massive pay rise leading to a more equal global income distribution.\"\n\nOxfam's report is based on data from Forbes and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth databook, which gives the distribution of global wealth going back to 2000.\n\nThe survey uses the value of an individual's assets, mainly property and land, minus debts, to determine what he or she \"owns\". The data excludes wages or income.\n\nThe methodology has been criticised as it means that a student with high debts, but with high future earning potential, for example, would be considered poor under the criteria used.\n\nBut Oxfam said even if the wealth of the poorest half of the world was recalculated to exclude people in net debt their combined wealth was still equal to that of just 128 billionaires."}, "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/26/stormfront-internets-longest-running-white-suprema/": {"title": "Stormfront, internet\u2019s longest-running white supremacist site, goes offline", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/26/stormfront-internets-longest-running-white-suprema/", "text": "Stormfront, one of the internet\u2019s oldest and most popular white supremacist sites, has been booted off its web address of more than two decades amid a crackdown against hate sites.\n\nThe address Stormfront.org went dark on Friday, and publicly available information current lists its domain status as \u201cunder hold,\u201d a category reserved for websites under legal dispute or slated for deletion, the USA Today network first reported.\n\nThe Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a D.C.-based nonprofit group, said it was behind the effort and had successfully booted the website from its domain of 22 years by raising its concerns with Stormfront\u2019s registrar, Network Solutions LLC, and its parent company, Web.com.\n\n\u201cTheir website is a vehicle used to promote racially-motivated violence and hate,\u201d Kristen Clarke, the committee\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cFollowing our efforts, Network Solutions has pulled the site.

Luis Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois once described as \u201cthe whipped cream on top of the White Nationalist/Neo-Nazi banana split.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Stormer\u2019s publisher, Andrew Anglin, wrote on article Aug. 12 mocking a woman killed hours earlier while protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, 32-year-old Heather Heyer. The Stormer was subsequently booted by domain registrars GoDaddy and Google, and attempted to relaunch at more than a half-dozen address this week before relegating itself to the so-called dark web where it\u2019s subject to less restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe shutting of Stormfront, via this new technique of domain seizure, sets a new precedent: you don\u2019t have to have made edgy jokes about a fat woman, you don\u2019t have to go viral, you don\u2019t even have to be the least bit culturally relevant.

And we should never downplay the vicious attack on gay brothers, lesbian sisters, bisexuals and trans folk, that was part of the chanting that took place the next day.\n\nBut what happened was, they held us hostage in the church. We could not leave after the service, because the torch march threatening the people who were there. And so, in that sense, I said, \u201cHmmm, boy, these neofascists, they\u2019re out of control. Where are the police?\u201d And who would think that our dear sister Heather, my dear comrade, who also was with IWW\u2014you know, that\u2019s very important. She was an organizer. She stood with us on Saturday. She paid the ultimate price. And many of us may have to pay that ultimate price.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to Reverend Traci Blackmon, but first to your MSNBC interview on Saturday, when you were in [Charlottesville], when you were rushed off the live shot as people around you were attacked. Let\u2019s go to that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was\u2014that was Joy Reid of MSNBC, as [Traci] Blackmon was whisked away by an ally right there on the set. Reverend Blackmon, what happened then?\n\nREV. TRACI BLACKMON: Well, I was giving the interview for Joy Reid\u2014and thank you for having me here. And I also want to echo my condolences, my deepest sympathy to the family of Heather and to the family of the law enforcement officers who also lost their lives in this unnecessary, tragic event. Joy Reid had invited me on her show to talk about what had happened at the church the night before. And they were not aware of what was happening in Charlottesville until I began to make some calls to let people know that Charlottesville was under attack. They immediately sent a team out to cover. And their news team was stationed inside the perimeter of the events that were happening Saturday. And so, I was asked to come and do an interview. And with the permission of local people on the scene, the community organizers from Charlottesville\u2014I asked them first\u2014I was given permission to do that interview. And in the midst of the interview, we began to hear pops. And I didn\u2019t know what those pops were. I still don\u2019t know what those pops were. But the security that was there rushed me off from the camera. I really didn\u2019t know what was happening in that moment.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s Reverend Traci Blackmon, who\u2019s speaking to us now from St. Louis, who was in Charlottesville this weekend, on Friday night addressing people in the church, and on Saturday on the street. Professor Jalane Schmidt is also with us. And you\u2019re with Black Lives Matter. You were very involved with the organizing around what took place. Can you tell us what happened this weekend, what you understood was going to happen, how people organized, and the kind of response by all of the authorities? Jalane Schmidt is just being seated right now, so let me go to Cornel West. I heard\u2014well, The Guardian reported that people that night, who were responding to the torch march, were actually attacked with swung torches, pepper spray and lighter fluid.\n\nCORNEL WEST: Absolutely. You had a number of the courageous students, of all colors, at the University of Virginia who were protesting against the neofascists themselves. The neofascists had their own ammunition. And this is very important to keep in mind, because the police, for the most part, pulled back. The next day, for example, those 20 of us who were standing, many of them clergy, we would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists who approached, over 300, 350 anti-fascists. We just had 20. And we\u2019re singing \u201cThis Little light of Mine,\u201d you know what I mean? So that the\u2014\n\nCORNEL WEST: The anti-fascists, and then, crucial, the anarchists, because they saved our lives, actually. We would have been completely crushed, and I\u2019ll never forget that. Meaning what? Meaning that you had the police holding back, on the one hand, so we couldn\u2019t even get arrested. We were there to get arrested. We couldn\u2019t get arrested, because the police had pulled back, and just allowing fellow citizens to go at each other, you see, and with all of the consequences that would follow therefrom.\n\nSo, in that sense, you know, I think what we\u2019re really seeing, though, Sister Amy, is the American empire in decay, with the rule of big money, with massive militarism, facilitated by the scapegoating of the most vulnerable, of immigrants, Muslims, Jews, Arabs, gay, lesbians, trans and bisexuals, and black folk. The white supremacy was so intense. I\u2019ve never seen that kind of hatred in my life. We stood there, and nine units went by, and looking right in our eyes. And they\u2019re cussing me out, and so forth and so on. They\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t lose my holy ghost, to tell you the truth, because I wanted to start swinging myself. I\u2019m a Christian, but not a pacifist, you know. But I held back. But that kind of hatred\u2014but that is just the theater. It\u2019s big money. It\u2019s big military. And it\u2019s the way in which this capitalist civilization is leading us toward unbelievable darkness and bleakness. And the beautiful thing is the fightback. It was a beautiful thing to see all the people coming back. But they had more fascists than anarchists, more fascists than fightback."}, "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/rottherdam-police-undress-youth-clothes-expensive-crime-gangs-racial-profiling-a8169631.html": {"title": "Dutch police to \u2018undress\u2019 youths wearing clothes deemed too expensive for them", "keywords": ["Rotterdam", " policing", " crime", " Netherlands", " Racial profiling", " Europe", " World", " News"], "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/rottherdam-police-undress-youth-clothes-expensive-crime-gangs-racial-profiling-a8169631.html", "text": "Police in the Dutch city of Rotterdam have launched a new pilot programme which will see them confiscating expensive clothing and jewellery from young people if they look too poor to own them.\n\nOfficers say the scheme will see them target younger men in designer clothes they seem unlikely to be able to afford legally \u2013 if it is not clear how the person paid for it, it will be confiscated.\n\nThe idea is to deter criminality by sending a signal that the men will not be able to hang onto their ill-gotten gains.\n\nRotterdam police chief Frank Paauw told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf: \u201cThey are often young men who consider themselves untouchable. We're going to undress them on the street.\n\n\u201cWe regularly take a Rolex from a suspect. Clothes rarely. And that is especially a status symbol for young people.

Her straight blonde hair is now cut short. Large blue eyes stand out in a face pale without makeup. Her soft Southern drawl has an undertone of determination. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me awhile, but now I\u2019m glad to be considered an \u201cunsuitable influence\u201d. That was how the school board justified my firing. That and \u201cdeviating from the curriculum. It\u2019s like they were implying I was a deviant. And according to their norms, I am.\u201d\n\nThe twenty-nine-year-old was fired for teaching her high school students how US foreign policy has provoked terrorism. This struggle with her school board turned her from a Republican into a revolutionary for peace.\n\nI taught my tenth grade American history class about what the USA has done for decades in the countries in which we now have terrorism. We work with the local oligarchs there to keep the country under control for our economic advantage. We support dictators and also the kind of managed democracy we have in the USA, where the only political parties that have a chance are those aligned with business and the private ownership of resources. People in those countries are tired of being kept at the bottom. They\u2019re tired of CIA coups and assassinations of progressive leaders. So now they\u2019re defending themselves the only way they can. And they\u2019re getting pretty good at it. This was a lesson for my class in history but also in cause and effect, as I explained what has provoked so many people to such anger at the USA. But the effect on me was that I got fired and now apparently blacklisted. One of the students had an uncle stationed in Iraq, and she reacted as if I had insulted him. She took it as an attack on her family. I reminded her that I wasn\u2019t criticizing our soldiers but the government\u2019s reasons for sending them there. I wanted very much for her uncle to return safely home. But she insisted I had no business saying any of that. That led to a mini-lesson on freedom of speech in which the whole class took part. It was one of the liveliest but also most emotionally charged discussions we\u2019d had. Several students were convinced what I had said were lies, and freedom of speech doesn\u2019t include the right to lie. They denied the USA had harmed these countries. They insisted the terrorists are maniacs who hate us for our freedom, hate us because we\u2019re Christian. We have to stop them before they kill us. While we were talking, I looked in the corner at the American flag with its red for the blood of our brave soldiers. Every morning the students put their hands over their hearts and pledge allegiance to that flag in a ritual designed to evoke tender feelings of identification with our country. I saw the portraits of the Founding Fathers on the walls, all looking so wise and kind, just the father every child would like to have. I thought about all the patriotic civics classes that teach us how great America is but leave out much of our history, particularly foreign policy. I realized these kids \u2014 all of us \u2014 are being indoctrinated, not just by the schools but also by the press and entertainment. Rather than thinking critically, we\u2019re encouraged to react emotionally. One of the media\u2019s purposes is to keep our emotions stirred up so we don\u2019t think too much. Several students took my side, but for some of them that was because I was the teacher, the authority figure. But others had really thought about the issue and added ideas of their own that had never occurred to me. One African-American girl made brilliant connections between the kind of invisible colonialism the USA tries to enforce on other countries and its domestic colonization of poor minority groups here. The discussion was an intense learning experience for us all. Its goal wasn\u2019t to try to change opinions but to clarify what we really believe and help us articulate that. We all benefited from it. Next day the principal called me in because of student complaints. My explanations didn\u2019t convince her, but she indicated if I apologized to the class and never did anything like this again, she could let the incident slide. When I refused, she said she\u2019d have to bring the matter before the school board. The board \u2014 made up of business leaders, a minister, and a retired educator \u2014 interviewed me and issued a report saying my \u2018inappropriate behavior and recalcitrant defense of it\u2019 left them no choice but to dismiss me. Previous to this, my professional evaluations had always been excellent. Since the firing, I\u2019ve applied for other jobs in the state and haven\u2019t got one interview. And there\u2019s a shortage of teachers in the state.\n\nJudy and I were talking in the cramped living-dining-room-kitchen of the rental trailer she had to move into after being fired. The air conditioner was broken, and the room was hot and humid. I was grateful for the iced tea with a sprig of mint.\n\nShe showed me photos of her as a high school and college cheerleader, full of pep and team spirit. Now she was embarrassed by them.\n\nI can look back and see how I was serving a ritual designed to make young people identify with their school and its team, cheering it on to victory over the other team. School sports are sort of trainer wheels to prepare us for military patriotism. We cheer our athletes, then we cheer our troops. Our group is naturally the special good one who deserves to win. It\u2019s interesting that George W. Bush was a cheerleader. But at the time I got fired, I hadn\u2019t thought of any of that. I was just examining the history of US involvement in the Mideast. I wasn\u2019t radical. My parents voted Republican, and I had followed their lead. But those days are over. The whole incident made it clear to me how much thought control goes on in our society, how mentally manipulating the media and the educational institutions are. After being fired I had lots of free time, so I read books by Naomi Klein, William Blum, and Howard Zinn. I learned more about how the power holders use patriotism to quash dissent and make the people afraid of outside enemies. I learned how the global rich act in their own interests regardless of nationality, and how this keeps the majority of the world in poverty. We\u2019re not going to have peace until we stop this. Now I\u2019m a waitress in a chain restaurant. That\u2019s been a good lesson in capitalism. I\u2019m making a lot less money, but the government still takes a hefty chunk of it to kill people they think are a threat to them.\n\nWhen I asked Judy what she was doing to stop that, she gestured self-mockingly at her petite form and said, \u201cBelieve it or not, this person, all 105 pounds of me, has become an enemy of the state. I\u2019m actively working to bring it down, particularly the patriarchal, capitalist form that we live under.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big assignment,\u201d I said. \u201cHow do you think we can build something different?\u201d\n\nWell, we first have to realize the men in charge aren\u2019t going to let us build anything really different,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey\u2019ll do everything they can, no matter how vicious, to hold on to power. And they\u2019ve got too many on their side now. I think our job is to clear the ground so something new can be built. We have to weaken this monolith so it will eventually fall, undermine it, chip away at it however we can. That\u2019s probably going to be a lifetime assignment for us. The generations who come after us can decide what to build in its place. That\u2019s their job, and it\u2019s presumptuous of us to try to do that for them. Planning a new society at this point seems to me to be just daydreaming, spinning fantasies. First we have to break this system\u2019s power. Otherwise our descendants will still be living under it.\n\nI objected that this sounds pessimistic, but she didn\u2019t agree.\n\nIt\u2019s clear by now that this system is not going to allow basic changes. Only superficial reforms come out of congress, and they\u2019re often reversed later on. Both major parties are tied to the business establishment, which wields the real power. The Democrats tolerate an occasional eccentric like Dennis Kucinich to create an impression of progress, but they don\u2019t have a chance of achieving power. The establishment uses them to channel public discontent into dead-end streets, to convince people if they wait another four years, this system could change. But it never does. Liberalism\u2019s purpose is to maintain the power structure by stringing people\u2019s hopes along to the next meaningless election. It\u2019s so much more comforting to believe things will improve someday and the system is mostly fair, just has a few problems. And from the top half of society it looks that way. But from the bottom half, especially overseas, it looks quite different. And that\u2019s where the changes are going to come from, not from the liberals.\n\n\u201cWhat do you see happening?\u201d I asked her.\n\nDirect action. There are all sorts of nonviolent ways to undermine power. Depriving the corporations and their government of money is a good start. This can be done by work sabotage, by tax evasion, by refusing to buy things. Consumer strikes are particularly important for women because the media are continually screaming at you to get new stuff. That\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to get rid of the feelings of inadequacy that patriarchy has instilled in you \u2014 grab the latest clothes, hairstyles, makeup, furnishings so you can feel better about yourself. But if you just stop obeying them, stop buying that crap, use the old stuff until it wears out, defy the image makers, then you liberate yourself from this sick culture. That\u2019s when you can really start feeling good about yourself. For one thing, you\u2019re definancing the war. Corporate and government resources are limited. Every dollar less that you give them is one they can\u2019t use to kill people overseas. This war has already devastated the economy. Taxes and the national debt are maxed out. They can\u2019t go higher. If costs continue to rise and we continue to lose, the only solution will be to pull out the troops. Mass murder has become a luxury the USA can no longer afford. Thousands of small acts of citizen sabotage will help pull the plug on the war. Making concrete suggestions about this could get me put in jail these days, so I can\u2019t be too specific. But each of us has gifts for resistance, and I think we should use them to toss monkey wrenches into the works. I have a few personal projects that mean a lot to me. Most Americans object to this approach because it might affect their personal lives. We\u2019ve been brought up to see that as our top priority. But allowing our government to be viciously militaristic will inevitably harm our lives more. To end the cycle, we have to stop the killing, even if that temporarily makes things harder for us. The two forms of aggression \u2014 wars abroad and declining wages at home \u2014 are linked. Both are functions of capitalism. We need to break its hold on us.\n\nBeneath the bravado, her voice was now tinged with anxiety. She didn\u2019t want to say too much. She didn\u2019t know me very well. She \u2014 like all of us \u2014 wasn\u2019t sure how far her freedoms go anymore.\n\n\u201cWhat if that helps someone like Bush or McCain get elected?\u201d I wanted to know.\n\nWith a dismissing wave she said:\n\nI asked her how she thinks we should oppose patriarchy.\n\nWith a mix of irony and sincerity that showed her to be both a radical feminist and a well-mannered Southern lady, she first asked me if I would like more iced tea. Then she said:\n\nBoth men and women have internalized patriarchal assumptions, and we\u2019ve been brought up to think that\u2019s the only way things can be. We need to root these implanted concepts out of us. Art can do that. Lesbian and gay cultures can do that. Some psychotherapies can do it. Theologies that oppose the notion of a Heavenly Father can do it. Patriarchy has robbed women of our power. That\u2019s why so many of us feel incomplete and inadequate. The culture tells us we need a man to fill that void, but we gradually and painfully learn that traps us in dependency. It isn\u2019t fair to the men either, because we\u2019ve given them the responsibility for making us whole, which is something another person can\u2019t do for you. This romantic myth we\u2019re fed is like a drug to keep us helpless \u2014 the opiate of the lasses. What we need is not a man. We need to take our power back. Then we can have an equal relationship with a man, if that\u2019s what we want. At some point opposing patriarchy almost always brings us into opposition to our fathers, and that\u2019s scary ground for a lot of us. Before women can change, we have to confront the part of ourselves that still needs our father\u2019s praise. As long as we unconsciously want to be daddy\u2019s little girl, we\u2019re going to support the system.\n\nI commented that it sounds like she\u2019s got over that.\n\nI said, \u201cNone of this \u2014 the political and personal change \u2014 is easy, is it?\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cFrom Cheerleader to Enemy of the State\u201d is a chapter from Radical Peace: People Refusing War, which presents the experiences of peace activists who have moved beyond petitions and demonstrations into direct action: helping soldiers to desert, destroying computer systems, trashing recruiting offices, burning military equipment, and sabotaging defense contractors.

He leaps into action without hesitation\u2014saving lives is what he\u2019s known for three decades.\n\nOther good Samaritans stop and pull over to help pry the victim, Rebecca Buchanan, from her crushed, green four-door sedan on the side of the road.\n\nAfter reviving Buchanan, a Georgia State Patrol trooper orders Rickerson to move his truck from the roadway.\n\nThe 30-year veteran fire chief refuses to leave her side.\n\nHe spent decades saving others, but the last life this retired fire chief saved, cost him his freedom. (Photo provided)\n\nMinutes later, the 56-year-old former battalion chief watches, handcuffed from the back of a police cruiser, as Buchanan, who clings to life, is loaded into a medical helicopter.\n\nHe\u2019s arrested for obstruction, and later, booked into the Pike County Jail.\n\nWhat happened that crisp fall evening along that rural two-lane highway has been debated, but all versions of the story conclude with a young mother surviving what could have been a fatal crash, and the man, who she credits with saving her life, ending up behind bars.\n\nJust before 5 p.m., on Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2017, the now-retired firefighter, drives westbound down GA 109 in Meansville, Ga.\n\nIt\u2019s a bright, Georgia autumn day\u2014blue skies dashed with a sprinkle of white puffy clouds; his 2003 white Toyota Tundra\u2019s tires crunch colorful leaves as they blow across the rural, winding road.\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nIn front of him, he watches in disbelief as a driver loses control of her car.\n\nThe car fishtails to the right and back to the left.\n\nThe driver hits the culvert with the front end of her car, catapulting the car forward.\n\nThe car soars into the air, flipping end over end\u2014over and over and over\u2014finally landing on its tires on the side of the road.\n\nRickerson jumps into action as he\u2019s done hundreds of times as a professional first responder, and runs straight to the victim\u2014leaving his truck in the middle of the road with the keys still in the ignition.\n\n\u201cMy training pretty much kicked in as soon as I witnessed the wreck,\u201d he recalled. \u201cYou go into the mode of firefighter when you see this happen.\n\n\u201cMany times, the worst thing you can do is nothing,\u201d Rickerson said.\n\nHe sees that her head is resting in the passenger seat.\n\n\u201cShe was not breathing. She was not responsive and there was no breath at all,\u201d said Rickerson who's in plain clothing--khaki shorts and a polo shirt, unlike his full firefighter garb of years' past.\n\nWithout pause, 911 calls begin flooding into Pike County\u2019s dispatch center, including from Rickerson.\n\nRickerson: \u201cThis 911? Pike County? This is Rick Rickerson, I\u2019m a retired battalion chief, Griffin Fire Department. I\u2019m on the scene of an overturned single vehicle with a single occupant, unresponsive at this time.\u201d\n\nRickerson: \u201cThere is entrapment. The doors will not open. The doors will not open. It\u2019s on its wheels. It\u2019s overturned at least three times.\u201d\n\nRickerson: \u201cShe is unresponsive and, at this time, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s breathing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rickerson and others who stopped to help, including Kristy Rodriguez, put everything they have into opening the car door and it breaks free.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that Rebecca was trapped\u2026 she wasn\u2019t breathing,\u201d said Rodriguez, who was fourth on the scene.\n\n\u201cI can hear Rick saying, we need to get her airway open. She\u2019s not breathing,\u201d she remembered.\n\nOne of the bystanders holds her head, another holds her shoulder, while Rickerson opens her mouth.\n\nAll he can see is blood.\n\nHe clears her airway with her shirt, but her mouth fills back up with blood.\n\nHe cleans it again.\n\n\u201cI never saw Rick leave the side of the vehicle,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI believe that Rick was right where he was supposed to be.\u201d\n\nAfter clearing her airway and making sure she can breathe, Rickerson calls 911 again.\n\nDispatcher: \u201cPike County 911, what\u2019s the address of your emergency?\u201d\n\nRickerson: Pike County 911, Rick Rickerson again on the wreck at 109.\u201d\n\nRickerson: \u201cNo first responders are here yet; can you advise your officer in charge of fire responding that Rick Rickerson is on the scene and I would suggest them requesting life flight.\u201d\n\nDispatcher: \u201cIt\u2019s already in the air.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher calls over the radio.\n\nTrooper: \u201cI\u2019m actually a trooper with the state patrol; I\u2019m in training, so I\u2019m kinda off.\u201d\n\nTrooper: \u201cIf you have access to life flight, I would definitely have them en route.\u201d\n\nGeorgia State Patrol trooper, Sgt. Rodney Jeter, arrives on the scene in an unmarked SUV.\n\nJeter, dressed in black pants, a black polo with the word \u201cinstructor\u201d embroidered on it and a black ball cap, gets out of his vehicle and approaches the vehicle, inquiring about the truck in the middle of the road.\n\n\u201cI cleared the blood again, and it was probably another 45 seconds before the second breath. And somewhere in that point, between the second and third breath, I heard, \u2018Whose truck is this?\u2019\u201d Rickerson said.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s mine,\u2019 He said, \u2018I need you to move it.\u2019 And I looked over at him and I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving this patient.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe turned sideways and said, \u2018Sir? I said I want this truck moved!\u2019 And again, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving my patient.\u2019 She had had only two or three breaths. I was prepared to breathe for her if she had stopped breathing again. I wasn\u2019t leaving that patient.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rickerson, there were no emergency medical personnel on the scene yet.\n\n\u201cThere [were] no first responders. So, I was the only one on the scene,\u201d he recalled.\n\nBut, according to the Georgia Department of Public Safety incident report filled out by Jeter, Rickerson was no longer rendering aid to Buchanan when he approached him about his truck.\n\n\u201cRickerson was standing behind two others that were kneeling down beside the vehicle. There were three people that were standing immediately around the vehicle,\u201d Jeter wrote in his report.\n\n\u201cHe was not touching the driver at the time and was not rendering aid. I called out to Rickerson and said, \u201cHey, sir, can you please move your vehicle?\u201d He replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not moving my vehicle right now!\u201d I replied, \u2018Sir, I need you to move your vehicle to make room for emergency vehicles that are coming.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe replied, \u201cI told you, I\u2019m not moving my vehicle right now, and I\u2019m not leaving this patient!\u201d\n\nJeter, according to the report, walks over to the accident scene, and identifies himself as a Sergeant with the Georgia State Patrol, explaining that he doesn\u2019t want his vehicle in the way of emergency vehicles coming to the scene.\n\n\u201c[Rickerson] stated, \u2018I don\u2019t care who you are. You can take me to jail, but I\u2019m not moving my vehicle or leaving this patient right now.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe kept following me, wanting me to hear him out,\u201d Rickerson said about the trooper. \u201cTelling me he was a paramedic.\n\n\u201cAnd I questioned him, \u2018You\u2019re a paramedic? You didn\u2019t put your hands on that patient. You didn\u2019t help us open that door.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll paramedics have vehicle extrication training. But he didn\u2019t do anything to assist us with this patient,\u201d Rickerson said.\n\nFollowing this exchange of words, one of the other witnesses on the chaotic scene, 40-year-old Emily Meadows, moves Rickerson\u2019s truck for him.\n\n\u201cI walked away and advised Mr. Rickerson I would speak with him later,\u201d Jeter said in the report.\n\nAs first responders arrive on the scene, Jeter points Rickerson out as the best witness for information about the crash to an officer and a few sheriff\u2019s deputies. However, he also reveals that he\u2019s had a run-in with him\u2014not following an order to move his truck.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be your best bet on some good witness information. I\u2019ll let you get that before I tell him what I\u2019m gonna tell him,\u201d he can be heard saying on one of the cruiser\u2019s dash cam.\n\n\u201cI almost\u2026 I come close\u2026 I had to really control myself to keep from arresting him just a while ago,\u201d he can be heard saying on one of the cruiser\u2019s dash cam.\n\nOther officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies on the scene chime in.\n\n\u201cHe thinks he knows every single thing there is to know about everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a piece of s**t. He\u2019s a piece of s**t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just hate. I hate. He is a piece. I told you there was something wrong with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis might get interesting,\u201d one says, laughing.\n\n\u201cAll I did was ask him to move his truck,\u201d Jeter responds.\n\nOnce Buchanan is loaded into the ambulance on a stretcher, awaiting the medical helicopter\u2019s arrival, Jeter approaches Rickerson once again.\n\n\u201cHey, buddy? Hey, sir? Come here,\u201d he\u2019s heard saying on the dash cam footage. \u201cAll I asked you to do is just move your vehicle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you know if I leave that patient with two civilians\u2026\u201d Rickerson explains.\n\n\u201c\u2026and she goes back not breathing. I opened up her airway to make her breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already told you my whole background,\u201d Jeter says to Rickerson.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about your background. I care about what happened right here. You\u2019re mad at me because I don\u2019t care about your background,\u201d Rickerson argues. \u201cYou know you ain\u2019t got no case here.\u201d\n\nJeter wrote in his report, \u201cIt was clear to me Mr. Rickerson refused to cooperate the entire time I spoke with him.\u201d\n\nRick Rickerson, a retired fire chief, said he saved a woman's life and then was handcuffed and arrested for not moving his truck.

His wife Lauren alerted his parents who went to help him. When Lauren called him back, all she heard was heavy breathing. She grew frantic and knew he was in distress. She sent texts pleading with him to call her. When his parents arrived on the scene, there was no sign of Alfred. His pickup truck was still parked at the package store, CL&M Grocery, Inc., but Alfred was long gone. The store clerk said she saw Alfred, who was dressed in scrubs, but claims after he talked on his cell phone, he stuffed his cell phone in his socks and took off running, of \u201chis own free will.\u201d\n\nAlfred knew help was on this way, so it\u2019s questionable that he\u2019d run off into the woods in a town where racial tension is highly prevalent.\n\nAlfred grew up in Jasper along with his four siblings. His father is a pastor and middle school gym teacher. \u201cAlfred was a man of great faith,\u201d his wife tells CNN. A football player while in college, she goes on to say \u201che loved his family, was very ambitious and hard working \u2026 fun loving and brilliant.\u201d\n\nHis family questions the sheriff\u2019s office commitment to finding Alfred when they abruptly halted the search after only four days, saying they\u2019ve exhausted their resources, Alfred would be listed as a missing person and there was no indication of foul play. They even said this case was likely drug related and Alfred ripped off his clothes after having hallucinations.\n\nAlfred\u2019s watch, clothing and his identification were found in the area near where deputies claimed to have searched.\n\nHis lifeless body was found 18 days after he went missing in November 2013, the week of Thanksgiving, near Hemphill in Sabine County, Tex. which is 45 minutes away from where \u201cin the pre-dawn hours of June 7, 1998, James Byrd Jr. was walking home in Jasper, when he was stopped by three white men who offered him a ride home. Byrd got in the bed of their pick-up truck, but the men did not take him home. Instead, they drove him to a desolate, wooded road east of town, beat him severely, chained him to the back of the truck by his ankles and dragged him for more than three miles. The murderers drove on for another mile before dumping his torso in front of an African American cemetery in Jasper,\u201d according to the police report.\n\nTragically, Alfred was found by volunteers and his father. He was stripped to his boxer shorts, wearing only a single sock with his cell phone tucked inside, and both his sneakers. He was missing an ear, two front teeth and his throat was slit. There was not a lot of decomposition in comparison to most bodies found in the elements after 18 days. On November 26, 2013, forensic pathologist John W. Ralston MD, ruled his death \u201caccidental\u201d due to \u201ccombined drug intoxication,\u201d in other words, a drug overdose \u2013 cocaine, methamphetamine and amphetamines.\n\nThe family isn\u2019t buying it because Alfred never used drugs. His family had their own autopsy and the pathologist concluded that he died of severe trauma to the neck and head and a gash across his throat.\n\nThe county\u2019s autopsy report didn\u2019t address the cut on his neck or throat area and also went on to report that any damage caused to the body was caused by animal activity, offering no explanation why the cut across his neck was a straight line and why the animals didn\u2019t chew him to the bone after being out in the woods for over 18 days.\n\nEvery single day that passes, evidence is lost or destroyed. Please help this family find answers. Alfred took care of his wife and three sons financially and the family is seeking donations, any help is appreciated.

When bouncers threw him out, Evans told them he was a cop and could have them arrested.\n\nNow, we're not police officers, but it seems like Evans managed to do everything a cop (or non-cop) should absolutely never do under any circumstances: operate a vehicle after drinking eight beers, abuse his title to receive better treatment, and sexually assault a virtual stranger. It's shocking that he didn't manage to torture any small animals on the ride over, but no man has time to get everything done off his checklist, especially when he's wasted.\n\nSome justice has been served: a jury convicted Evans of sexual abuse and the police force fired him from his post. But Judge Jacqueline Hatch \u2014 appointed by Jan Brewer, who currently holds the title of America's Worst Governor Ever (a very competitive ranking!) \u2014 decided that Evans didn't deserve jail time because he didn't have a criminal record and because his friends really like him. Also, because the woman in question is a total whore who occasionally leaves her house at night to socialize in public spaces.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Daily Sun, here's how the slut-shaming went down:\n\nBad things can happen in bars, Hatch told the victim, adding that other people might be more intoxicated than she was. \"If you wouldn't have been there that night, none of this would have happened to you,\" Hatch said. Hatch told the victim and the defendant that no one would be happy with the sentence she gave, but that finding an appropriate sentence was her duty. \"I hope you look at what you've been through and try to take something positive out of it,\" Hatch said to the victim in court. \"You learned a lesson about friendship and you learned a lesson about vulnerability.\" Hatch said that the victim was not to blame in the case, but that all women must be vigilant against becoming victims. \"When you blame others, you give up your power to change,\" Hatch said that her mother used to say.\n\nWe wouldn't be surprised if Hatch decides to write an inspirational self-help book for young women sometime in the near future. Chapter One: Friends Don't Let Friends Get Fingered by Drunk Cops! Chapter Two: Be the Change You Want to See In Yourself by Not Blaming that Police Officer for Sexually Assaulting You! Chapter Three: The \"Bright Side\" of Rape!\n\nThere are so many more mind-blowingly horrible aspects to this story that you might want to stop reading for a second and do a little rage-dance before continuing. We'll wait.\n\nIn a more perfect world, everyone would be forced to read a transcript of these trial proceedings to understand the definitive meaning of rape culture. We would print Hatch's words in textbooks across the nation as an example of how not to talk to those who are taken advantage of by people in high-ranking positions. But all we can hope for right now is that more women will ignore everything that ever comes out of Hatch's evil mouth and follow in the victim's brave, brave footsteps.\n\nNo jail time for Flagstaff cop in bar groping [Arizona Daily Sun]"}, "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gay-marriage-and-other-major-rulings-at-the-supreme-court/2015/06/25/ef75a120-1b6d-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html?tid=sm_tw": {"title": "Supreme Court rules gay couples nationwide have a right to marry", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gay-marriage-and-other-major-rulings-at-the-supreme-court/2015/06/25/ef75a120-1b6d-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html?tid=sm_tw", "text": "A deeply divided Supreme Court on Friday delivered a historic victory for gay rights, ruling 5 to 4 that the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live.\n\nThe court\u2019s action rewarded years of legal work by same-sex marriage advocates and marked the culmination of an unprecedented upheaval in public opinion and the nation\u2019s jurisprudence.\n\nMarriages began Friday in states that had previously thwarted the efforts of same-sex couples to wed, while some states continued to resist what they said was a judicial order that changed the traditional definition of marriage and sent the country into uncharted territory. As of the court\u2019s decision Friday morning, there were 14 states where same-sex couples were not allowed to marry.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who has written all of the court\u2019s decisions recognizing and expanding gay rights, said the decision was based on the fundamental right to marry and the equality that must be afforded gay Americans.\n\n\u201cUnder the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right,\u201d Kennedy wrote. He was joined in the ruling by the court\u2019s liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nAll four of the court\u2019s most conservative members \u2014 Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 dissented, and each wrote a separate opinion.\n\nThe common theme in their dissents was that judicial activism on the part of five members of the court had usurped a power that belongs to the people.\n\n\u201cIf you are among the many Americans \u2014 of whatever sexual orientation \u2014 who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today\u2019s decision,\u201d wrote Roberts, who for the first time in his tenure marked his disagreement with a decision by reading part of his dissent from the bench.\n\n\u201cCelebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nScalia called the decision a \u201cthreat to American democracy,\u201d saying it robs citizens of \u201cthe freedom to govern themselves.\u201d\n\n[It\u2019s the first time Roberts has had such a bold statement from the bench]\n\nIn a statement in the White House Rose Garden, President Obama hailed the decision: \u201cThis ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are truly treated as equal, we are more free.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2012 that Obama declared that same-sex couples should be able to marry, and it was only last year that he said he thought the Constitution provided such a right. But by Friday evening, the rainbow colors that gay rights activists have adopted were projected onto the north face of the White House. With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Obama said, \u201cToday we can say in no uncertain terms that we have made our union a little more perfect.\u201d\n\nThere were wild scenes of celebrations on the sidewalk outside the Supreme Court. Same-sex marriage supporters had arrived early, armed with signs and rainbow flags. They cheered at the announcement of a constitutional right for gay marriage, which did not legally exist anywhere in the world until the turn of this century. The first legally recognized same-sex marriages in the United States took place just 11 years ago, the result of a Massachusetts state supreme court decision.\n\nJim Obergefell, who became the face of the case, Obergefell v. Hodges, when he sought to put his name on his husband\u2019s Ohio death certificate as the surviving spouse, said, \u201cToday\u2019s ruling from the Supreme Court affirms what millions across the country already know to be true in our hearts: that our love is equal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past, that from this day forward it will be, simply, marriage,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Austin R. Nimocks, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group that supports traditional marriage, said: \u201cToday, five lawyers took away the voices of more than 300 million Americans to continue to debate the most important social institution in the history of the world. . . . Nobody has the right to say that a mom or a woman or a dad or a man is irrelevant. There are differences that should be celebrated.\u201d\n\n[Opponents of gay marriage are divided on whether to resist the ruling]\n\nThe Supreme Court used cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, where restrictions against same-sex marriage were upheld by an appeals court last year, to find that the Constitution does not allow such prohibitions.\n\nKennedy over the past 20 years has written the Supreme Court\u2019s most important gay rights cases: overturning criminal laws on homosexual conduct, protecting gays from discrimination and declaring that the federal government could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed where they were legal.\n\nHe often employs a lofty, \u00adwriting-for-history tone, and Friday\u2019s decision was no different.\n\nReferring to the couples who brought the cases before the court, Kennedy wrote: \u201cIt would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization\u2019s oldest institutions.\u201d\n\nKennedy did not respond directly to the court\u2019s dissenters, but he addressed the argument that the court was creating a constitutional right. The right to marriage is fundamental, he said. The difference is society\u2019s evolving view of gay people and their rights, he said.\n\n\u201cThe limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter.\u201d\n\nAs in previous decisions, Kennedy did not spell out how courts should scrutinize laws that treated gays differently. But Mary Bonauto, who argued the case for gay plaintiffs at the Supreme Court, said that message from Kennedy\u2019s combined opinions \u201cis one of inclusion: Stop making rules for gay people.\u201d\n\nScalia was a sharp critic of Kennedy\u2019s style, saying it was \u201cas pretentious as its content is egotistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie,\u201d Scalia wrote.\n\nRoberts wrote a lengthy dissent that was a point-by-point takedown of the majority opinion. Gay activists had wondered whether the 60-year-old justice might take note of the increasing public support for same-sex marriage and find a way to join the majority on what they called the \u201cright side of history.\u201d\n\nBut he and the other dissenters said the question was not whether same-sex marriage was a good idea, but who should decide.\n\n\u201cThe court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cJust who do we think we are?\u201d\n\nRoberts rejected a comparison to Loving v. Virginia, in which the court struck down bans on interracial marriage. That did not change the age-old definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, he said. He raised concerns that the decision could lead to polygamous marriages \u2014 he mentioned a married threesome of lesbians called a \u201cthrouple.\u201d\n\nHe noted that voters and legislators in only 11 states had authorized same-sex marriages, and said it was better for gay marriage to be adopted through the democratic process than by judicial order. He said religious leaders could take little comfort from the majority opinion that their beliefs would be respected.\n\nThat theme was picked up by Alito in his dissent. He said there could be \u201cbitter and lasting wounds\u201d from the decision and warned that the decision will be \u201cexploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent.\u201d\n\nThe questions raised in the cases decided Friday were left unanswered in 2013, when the justices last confronted the issue of same-sex marriage. A slim majority of the court said at the time that a key portion of the Defense of Marriage Act \u2014 withholding the federal government\u2019s recognition of same-sex marriages \u2014 was unconstitutional. In a separate case that year, the court said procedural issues kept it from answering the constitutional question in a case from California but allowed same-sex marriages to resume in that state.\n\nSince then, courts across the nation \u2014 with the notable exception of the Cincinnati-based federal appeals court that left intact the restrictions in the four states at issue \u2014 have struck down a string of state prohibitions on same-sex marriage, many of them passed by voters in referendums.\n\nJerry Markon, David Nakamura and Sandhya Somashekhar contributed to this report."}, "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16689838/fcc-net-neutrality-comments-were-largely-ignored": {"title": "FCC ignored your net neutrality comment, unless you made a \u2018serious\u2019 legal argument", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16689838/fcc-net-neutrality-comments-were-largely-ignored", "text": "The FCC received a record-breaking 22 million comments chiming in on the net neutrality debate, but from the sound of it, it\u2019s ignoring the vast majority of them.

Under orders from the head of the Parisian police, Maurice Papon, the French National Police attacked a demonstration of some 30,000 pro-National Liberation Front (FLN) Algerians. After 37 years of denial and censorship of the press, in 1998 the French government finally acknowledged 40 deaths, although there are estimates of 100 to 300 victims.[1] Death was due to heavy-handed beating by the police, as well as massive drownings, as police officers threw demonstrators in the river Seine.\n\nThe massacre appears to have been intentional, as has been demonstrated by historian Jean-Luc Einaudi (fr), who won a trial against Maurice Papon in 1999 (Papon had been convicted in 1998 on charges of crimes against humanity for his role under the Vichy collaborationist regime during World War II). Official documentation and eyewitnesses within the Paris police department indeed suggest that the 1961 massacre was directed by Papon himself. Police records show that Papon called for officers in one station to be \"subversive\" in quelling the demonstrations, and assured them protection from prosecution if they participated.[2]\n\nForty years after the massacre, on 17 October 2001, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the Socialist Mayor of Paris, put up a plaque in remembrance of the massacre on the Saint-Michel bridge.[3][4] How many demonstrators were killed is still unclear. In the absence of official estimates, the placard which commemorates the massacre stated: \"In memory of the many Algerians killed during the bloody repression of the peaceful demonstration of 17 October 1961\". On 18 February 2007 (the day after Papon's death), calls were made for a Paris M\u00e9tro station under construction in Gennevilliers to be named \"17 Octobre 1961\" in commemoration of the massacre.[5][6]\n\nThe events were documented by a number of photographs, many of them graphic.[7]\n\nOn 17 October 1961, the massacre took place in the context of the Algerian War (1954\u201362), which had become more and more violent over the years. After de Gaulle's equivocal return to power during the May 1958 crisis and his sudden change of policy concerning Algerian independence, the OAS used all possible means to oppose the National Liberation Front (FLN), which took the war to the metropolis where it was helped by some activists such as the Jeanson network. The repression by French authorities, both in Algeria and in metropolitan France, was very harsh.\n\nAccording to historian Jean-Luc Einaudi, a specialist on the massacre, some of the causes of the violent repression of the 17 October 1961 demonstration can best be understood in terms of the composition of the French police force itself, which still included many former members of the force in place during the World War II Vichy regime which had collaborated with the Gestapo to detain Jews, as for example in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup of 16\u201317 July 1942.\n\nThe vast majority of police officers suspended after the Liberation of Paris in 1944 for extreme forms of collaborationism (including assistance to the Parti Populaire Fran\u00e7ais and similar groups) were later reintegrated into the police forces. In contrast, some of the policemen who had been part of the Resistance movement had their career advancement blocked because of Cold War anti-communism, since the Resistance was partially communist and communist ministers had been expelled from the government in May 1947. Moreover, police officers who had been members of the Resistance might well have taken part in the various raids against Jews and other persecuted groups during the Vichy regime, as otherwise they would have been dismissed, according to J.-L. Einaudi and Maurice Rajsfus.\n\nThe career of Maurice Papon as Head of Paris' police force in the 1960s and Minister of Finance under Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing's presidency in the 1970s, suggests that there was institutional racism in the French police until at least the 1960s. In fact, Papon was not charged and convicted until 1997\u201398 for his World War II crimes against humanity in being responsible for the deportation of 1,560 Jews, including children and the elderly, between 1942 and 1944.\n\nBefore his appointment as chief of the Paris police, Papon had been, since 1956, prefect of the Constantine department in Algeria, where he actively participated in the repression of and the use of torture against the civilian population.[8] On 13 March 1958, 7,000 policemen demonstrated in the courtyard of the police headquarters, against the delays in the \"risque prime\" accorded to them because of the war, although the FLN had not yet begun to target police officers at this time.[9] Encouraged by far-right deputy Jean-Marie Le Pen, 2,000 of them attempted to enter the Palais Bourbon, seat of the National Assembly, with shouts of \"Sales Juifs! A la Seine! Mort aux fellaghas!\" (Dirty Jews! Into the Seine (river)! Death to the (Algerian) rebels!). With the recommendation of Minister of Interior Maurice Bourg\u00e8s-Maunoury, Maurice Papon was next day named prefect of the police. Two years earlier, in Constantine, Algeria, he had assumed the role of \"Inspecteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour l'administration en mission extraordinaire\" (IGAME \u2013 General Inspector for the Administration on Extraordinary Mission). \"Prohibited zones, detention centers ('camps de regroupements'), torture, executions without trial: this is the reality of the war he [Papon] was supervising out there.\" According to Einaudi, in the following years he applied these methods in Paris and the Seine department.[10]\n\nAfter the May 1958 crisis and the installation of the new Fifth Republic under 'Free France' leader Charles de Gaulle's leadership, Maurice Papon was kept on. Papon created the 'compagnies de district' (district companies), police forces that specialized in repression, where new police recruits were trained. These district companies were formed mainly from veterans of the Indochina War (1947\u201354) and young Frenchmen coming back from Algeria.\n\nOn 25 August 1958, an FLN offensive in Paris killed three policemen on boulevard de l'H\u00f4pital in the 13th arrondissement and another in front of the cartoucherie de Vincennes. The Prefect of police, Maurice Papon, organized in retaliation massive raids on Algerian people in Paris and its suburbs. More than 5,000 Algerians were detained in the former Beaujon hospital, in the Japy gymnasium (11th arrondissement) and in the V\u00e9l'd'Hiv \u2013 the Japy gymnasium and the V\u00e9l'd'Hiv had been used as detention centers under P\u00e9tain's collaborationist regime.[11] A former member of the FTP resistance, reporter Madeleine Rifaud then wrote in L'Humanit\u00e9:\n\nAccording to Einaudi, \"Already at this time, policemen [were] boasting about throwing Algerians in the Seine\" river.[11] Vincennes' \"identification center\" (CIV \u2013 Centre d'identification de Vincennes) was then created under the authority of the prefecture of police in January 1959. Algerians detained during police raids in the Paris region could be brought there for identity verifications but could also be put under house arrest by the police prefect. \"These raids were frequently the occasion of violence.\" Einaudi stated.[12]\n\nThe Auxiliary Police Force (FPA \u2013 Force de police auxiliaire) was then created in 1959. This special constabulary force, put under the authority of the Algerian Affairs Coordination Center of the Prefecture of Police (Centre de coordination des Affaires alg\u00e9riennes de la pr\u00e9fecture de police) and supervised by the military, was under the control of the police prefect, Maurice Papon. Led by Captain Raymond Montaner and based at the Fort de Noisy, Romainville, it was composed entirely of Algerian Muslims \u2013 recruited either in Algeria or in France. In autumn 1960, the FPA was composed of 600 members. It first operated in the 13th arrondissement where it requisitioned caf\u00e9-hotels. Torture is rumoured to have been utilized most notably at 9, rue Harvey and 208, rue du Ch\u00e2teau des Rentiers. Disappearances took place. The FPA then extended its action to the 18th arrondissement, where three hotels were requisitioned in rue de la Goutte-d'Or. The FPA was also active in the suburbs, from the summer of 1961, in particular in Nanterre's bidonvilles. Some voices were opposed to these crimes denied by the police prefecture\".[13] Christian magazine T\u00e9moignage Chr\u00e9tien wrote: \"It is not possible to stay mute when, in our Paris, men are resurrecting the methods of the Gestapo\".[14]\n\nThe FLN decided to resume bombings against the French police at the end of August 1961; from the end of August 1961 to the beginning of October 1961, 11 policemen were killed and 17 injured (in Paris and its suburbs). \"These bombings had the effect of spreading fear throughout the ranks of the Paris police, but also for increasing the desire for revenge and hate against the whole of the community. During the whole of September, the Algerian population was severely repressed. In practice, this massive repression was based on physical appearance\", according to Einaudi.[15] Daily raids against Algerians \u2014 frequently confusing any Magreb people (Moroccans or Tunisians), and even Spanish or Italian immigrants, with Algerians. \u2013 Algerians were arrested at work or in the streets and were thrown into the Seine with their hands tied in order to drown them, among the other methods used for this repression, as shown for example by a report published by the priest, Joseph Kerlan, from the Mission de France.[16]\n\nAccording to historian Einaudi, \"It was in this climate that, on 2 October, during the funerals of a policeman killed by the FLN, the police prefect [Papon] proclaimed, in the prefecture's courtyard: \"For one hit taken we shall give back ten!\" This call [was] an encouragement to kill Algerians and [was] immediately understood as such. On the same day, visiting Montrouge's police station, the prefect of police declared to the police officers present: \"You also must be subversive in the war that sets you against others. You will be covered, I give you my word on that.\"[17]\n\nOn 5 October 1961, the prefecture of police, whose chief was Maurice Papon, announced in a press statement the introduction of a curfew from 8.30 p.m. to 5.30 a.m. in Paris and its suburbs for \"Algerian Muslim workers\", \"French Muslims\" and \"French Muslims of Algeria\" (all three terms used by Papon, although the approximately 150,000 Algerians living at the time in Paris were officially considered French and possessed a French identity card). The French Federation of the FLN thus called upon the whole of the Algerian population in Paris, men, women and children, to demonstrate against the curfew, widely regarded as a racist administrative measure, on 17 October 1961. According to historian Jean-Luc Einaudi, the head of the police, Maurice Papon, had 7,000 policemen, 1,400 CRS and gendarmes mobiles (riot police) to block this demonstration, to which the Prefecture of Police had not given its agreement (mandatory for legal demonstrations). The police forces thus blocked all access to the capital, metro stations, train stations, Paris' Portes, etc. Of a population of about 150,000 Algerians living in Paris, 30,000\u201340,000 of them managed to join the demonstration however. Police raids were carried out all over the city. 11,000 persons were arrested, and transported by RATP bus to the Parc des Expositions and other internment centers used under Vichy.[2] Those detained included not only Algerians, but also Moroccans and Tunisians immigrants, who were then sent to the various police stations, to the courtyard of the police prefecture, the Palais des Sports of Porte de Versailles (15th arrondissement), and the Stade Pierre de Coubertin, etc.\n\nDespite these raids, 4,000 to 5,000 people succeeded in demonstrating peacefully on the Grands Boulevards from R\u00e9publique to Op\u00e9ra, without incident. Blocked at Op\u00e9ra by police forces, the demonstrators backtracked. Reaching the Rex cinema (the site as the present Le Rex Club on the \"Grands Boulevards\"), the police opened fire on the crowd and charged, leading to several deaths. On the Neuilly bridge (separating Paris from the suburbs), the police detachments and FPA members also shot at the crowd, killing some. Algerians were thrown into and drowned in the Seine at points across the city and its suburbs, most notably at the Saint-Michel bridge in the center of Paris and near the Prefecture of Police, very close to Notre Dame de Paris.\n\nIn 1961, the police prefecture spoke only of \"2 persons shot dead\".[19] Following historian Jean-Luc Einaudi's testimony during the Papon trial in the late-1990s, left-wing police Minister Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement ordered the opening of parts of the archives. The resulting Mandelken Report, based on the investigation of these partial records, counted 32 dead. Einaudi then published an op-ed in Le Monde on 20 May 1998, contesting this official figure, criticizing both the methodology of the report and the consulted records. He called attention to the fact that many of the records had been destroyed. A report that Papon had prepared for Interior Minister Roger Frey, the prime minister, and the head of government, Charles de Gaulle, was not included in the consulted records. In addition, the Mandelken report ignored the massacre that had taken place in the courtyard of the Police prefecture, and Papon's name itself appeared nowhere in the report. Einaudi concluded his op-ed stating that: \"on the night of 17 October 1961 there had been a massacre perpetrated by the police forces acting on the orders of Maurice Papon.\" Papon subsequently filed a lawsuit in February 1999, a courtsuit against him, because of this sentence, alleging defamation of a public servant.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the state acknowledged in 1998 the massacre and spoke of 40 dead.\n\nResponding to Papon's request, the court gave an ambiguous judgement. It stated that Einaudi had \"defamed\" Papon, but that Einaudi had acted on \"good faith\", and praised the \"seriousness and quality\" of Einaudi's research.[20] Both Papon and Einaudi were thus vindicated by the court's judgement.\n\nThe French juridical system lacks formal independence from the executive branch of the French government, and is subject to executive pressures which calls into question judicial findings. For example, the trials about the corruption scandals in the Paris region, and the Taiwan frigates scandal \u2013 Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 have both been subjected to questions about executive pressure. These pressures on the judiciary system have been denounced by the judge's trade-union.\n\nThe French government commission in 1998 claimed only 48 people died. The historian Jean-Luc Einaudi (La Bataille de Paris, Paris: Seuil, 1991) asserted that as many as 200 Algerians had been killed. The historian Jean-Paul Brunet found satisfactory evidence for the murder of 31 Algerians, while suggesting that a number of up to 50 actual victims was credible.[21]\n\nThis contradicts David Assouline, who was granted in 1997 limited access to consult part of the police documents (which were supposed to be classified until 2012) by Minister of Culture Catherine Trautmann (PS). He found a list of 70 persons killed, while the texts confirmed Einaudi's comments that the magistrates who had been called on by the victims' families to consider these incidents had systematically acquitted the policemen. According to Le Monde in 1997, which quoted the director of the Paris Archives, the register listed 90 persons by the second half of October.[22]\n\nIn a 2001 article in Esprit, Paul Thibaud discussed the controversy between Jean-Luc Einaudi, who spoke of 200 killed on 17 October, and 325 killed by the police during the autumn of 1961, and Jean-Paul Brunet, who gave an estimate of only 50 (and 160 dead, possible homicide victims, who passed through the IML medico-legal institute during the four months between September and December 1961). Although criticizing Einaudi on some points, Thibaud also underlined that Brunet had consulted only police archives and took the registers of the IML medico-legal institute at face value. Based on other sources, Thibaud pointed out (as did Brunet) that administrative dissimulation about the dead had taken place, and that the IML could not be relied upon as sole source. Thibaud concluded that Einaudi's work made it possible to give an estimate of 300 Algerian victims of murder (whether by police or others) between 1 September and 31 December 1961.[23]\n\nThe events surrounding the massacre and its death toll were largely unknown for decades. There was almost no media coverage at the time. These events remained unknown in part because they were overshadowed in the French media by the Charonne Metro Station massacre on 8 February 1962 whose victims were not only Algerians, but also French members of the Communist Party.\n\nOn 26 October 1961, Georges Montaron, editor of T\u00e9moignage Chr\u00e9tien, Claude Bourdet, editor of France Observateur, Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie, editor of Lib\u00e9ration, Avril, editor of T\u00e9l\u00e9rama, parish priest Lochard, Jean-Marie Domenach, editor of Esprit magazine, Jean Schaeffert and Andr\u00e9 Souqui\u00e8re organized in the Maison de la Mutualit\u00e9 a meeting to \"protest against police violences and the repression of the 17 October 1961 demonstration in Paris\".\n\nA few days later, some anonymous policemen published a text called A group of republican policemen declare... (Un groupe de policiers r\u00e9publicains d\u00e9clarent...) on 31 October, stating:\n\nWhat happened on 17 October 1961 and in the following days against the peaceful demonstrators, on which no weapons were found, morally forces us to bring our testimony and to alert public opinion... All guilty people must be punished. The punishment must be extended to all of the responsible people, those who give orders, those who feign of letting it happen, whatever their high office may be... Among the thousands of Algerians brought to the Parc des Expositions of the Porte de Versailles, tens were killed by blows from rifle butts and pickaxe handles... In one of the extremity of the Neuilly bridge, groups of policemen on one side, CRS on the other, moved slowly towards each other. All the Algerians captured in this huge trap were knocked out and systematically thrown in the Seine. A good hundred people were subjected to this treatment... [In the Parisian police headquarters], torturers threw their victims by tens in the Seine which flows only a few meters from the courtyard, to keep them from being examined by the forensic scientists. Not before having taken their watches and money. Mr. Papon, prefect of the police, and Mr. Legay, general director of the municipal police, assisted to these horrible scenes... These indisputable facts are only a small part of what has happened in these last days and what continues to happen. They are known by the municipal police. The extortions committed by the harkis, the district special brigades, the brigades des aggressions et violences are not secret any more. The little information given by the newspapers is nothing compared to the truth... We do not sign this text and sincerely regret it. We observe, not without sadness, that the current circumstances do not allow us to do so...[24]\n\nThe anonymous authors remained so until the late 1990s although Maurice Papon tried to discover them. In February 1999, its main author, Emile Portzer, former member of the National Front resistance organization during the war, testified in favor of historian Jean-Luc Einaudi during the trial which followed Papon's suit against him (won by Einaudi). On 1 January 1962, the police prefect Papon declared to the police forces under his orders: \"On 17 October you won... the victory against Algerian terrorism... Your moral interests have been successfully defended, since the aim of the police prefecture's opponents to put in place an investigation committee have been defeated.\"[25]\n\nOn 8 February 1962, another demonstration against the OAS, which had been prohibited by the state, was repressed at Charonne metro station (Affaire de la station de m\u00e9tro Charonne). Nine members of the CGT trade union, most of them communists, were killed by the police forces, directed by Maurice Papon under the same government, with Roger Frey as Minister of Interior, Michel Debr\u00e9 as Prime Minister and Charles de Gaulle as president, who did all they could to \"dissimulate the scale of the 17 October crime\" (Jean-Luc Einaudi[26]). The funerals on 13 February 1962 of the nine persons killed (among them, Fanny Dewerpe) were attended by hundreds of thousands of people.[27][28][29] On 8 February 2007 the Place du 8 F\u00e9vrier 1962, a square near the metro station, was dedicated by Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the mayor of Paris, after sprays of flowers were deposited at the foot of a commemorative plaque installed inside the metro station where the killings occurred.\n\nAccording to James J. Napoli, coverage of the massacre by major British and American media sources, such as The Times, TIME magazine and The New York Times, downplayed the severity of the massacre as well as the Paris government's responsibility for the events.[30]\n\nThe official death toll was initially three, before the French government acknowledged in 1998 that the massacre occurred and that a vague \"several dozen\" people were killed.[31]\n\nNo one has been prosecuted for participation in the killings, because they fell under the general amnesty for crimes committed during the Algerian War. This included on one side French police and military personnel fighting for France; and on the other side various French-ethnic (pro-independence, often communist) and Algerian fighters, for attacks on civilian targets such as caf\u00e9s, which killed 3,000 civilians.[citation needed]\n\nForty years after the massacre, in 2001, the event was officially acknowledged by the city of Paris with the placement and unveiling of a memorial plaque near the Pont Saint-Michel.[3][4] This resulted from work by the Socialist Party local government. At the unveiling of the plaque, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the Socialist Party Mayor of Paris, cited the need for France to come to terms with this event in order to move forward with unity. Centrist and right-wing politicians, as well as the police union, objected to the plaque on various grounds (increased threat of civil unrest, alleged tolerance of terrorism, and encouragement of disrespect for the police). On the other hand, historian Olivier LeCour Grandmaison, president of the 17 October 1961 Association, declared to L'Humanit\u00e9 that \"if a step forward had been taken with the decision of the city of Paris to put a commemorative plaque on the Pont Saint-Michel, [he] deplored that the text which was chosen for it invokes neither the idea of a crime against humanity nor the responsibility of the author of the crime, the state. Thus, in no case does this Parisian initiative exempt the highest national authorities from taking responsibility. In addition, if [former Socialist Prime minister] Lionel Jospin personally expressed himself last year [in 2000] by speaking of \"tragic events\", neither the police's responsibility in the crime nor that of those politically responsible at the time have been clearly established, much less officially condemned.\".[32] On 17 October 2012, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande acknowledged the 1961 massacre of Algerians in Paris.[33]"}, "http://www.alternet.org/vision/151850/8_reasons_young_americans_don%27t_fight_back%3A_how_the_us_crushed_youth_resistance/?page=entire": {"title": "8 Reasons Young Americans Don't Fight Back: How the US Crushed Youth Resistance", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.alternet.org/vision/151850/8_reasons_young_americans_don%27t_fight_back%3A_how_the_us_crushed_youth_resistance/?page=entire", "text": "8 Reasons Young Americans Don't Fight Back: How the US Crushed Youth Resistance\n\nTraditionally, young people have energized democratic movements. So it is a major coup for the ruling elite to have created societal institutions that have subdued young Americans and broken their spirit of resistance to domination.\n\nYoung Americans\u2014even more so than older Americans\u2014appear to have acquiesced to the idea that the corporatocracy can completely screw them and that they are helpless to do anything about it. A 2010 Gallup poll asked Americans \u201cDo you think the Social Security system will be able to pay you a benefit when you retire?\u201d Among 18- to 34-years-olds, 76 percent of them said no. Yet despite their lack of confidence in the availability of Social Security for them, few have demanded it be shored up by more fairly payroll-taxing the wealthy; most appear resigned to having more money deducted from their paychecks for Social Security, even though they don\u2019t believe it will be around to benefit them.\n\nHow exactly has American society subdued young Americans?\n\n1. Student-Loan Debt. Large debt\u2014and the fear it creates\u2014is a pacifying force. There was no tuition at the City University of New York when I attended one of its colleges in the 1970s, a time when tuition at many U.S. public universities was so affordable that it was easy to get a B.A. and even a graduate degree without accruing any student-loan debt. While those days are gone in the United States, public universities continue to be free in the Arab world and are either free or with very low fees in many countries throughout the world. The millions of young Iranians who risked getting shot to protest their disputed 2009 presidential election, the millions of young Egyptians who risked their lives earlier this year to eliminate Mubarak, and the millions of young Americans who demonstrated against the Vietnam War all had in common the absence of pacifying huge student-loan debt.\n\nToday in the United States, two-thirds of graduating seniors at four-year colleges have student-loan debt, including over 62 percent of public university graduates. While average undergraduate debt is close to $25,000, I increasingly talk to college graduates with closer to $100,000 in student-loan debt. During the time in one\u2019s life when it should be easiest to resist authority because one does not yet have family responsibilities, many young people worry about the cost of bucking authority, losing their job, and being unable to pay an ever-increasing debt. In a vicious cycle, student debt has a subduing effect on activism, and political passivity makes it more likely that students will accept such debt as a natural part of life.\n\n2. Psychopathologizing and Medicating Noncompliance. In 1955, Erich Fromm, the then widely respected anti-authoritarian leftist psychoanalyst, wrote, \u201cToday the function of psychiatry, psychology and psychoanalysis threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man.\u201d Fromm died in 1980, the same year that an increasingly authoritarian America elected Ronald Reagan president, and an increasingly authoritarian American Psychiatric Association added to their diagnostic bible (then the DSM-III) disruptive mental disorders for children and teenagers such as the increasingly popular \u201coppositional defiant disorder\u201d (ODD). The official symptoms of ODD include \u201coften actively defies or refuses to comply with adult requests or rules,\u201d \u201coften argues with adults,\u201d and \u201coften deliberately does things to annoy other people.\u201d\n\nMany of America\u2019s greatest activists including Saul Alinsky (1909\u20131972), the legendary organizer and author of Reveille for Radicals and Rules for Radicals, would today certainly be diagnosed with ODD and other disruptive disorders. Recalling his childhood, Alinsky said, \u201cI never thought of walking on the grass until I saw a sign saying \u2018Keep off the grass.\u2019 Then I would stomp all over it.\u201d Heavily tranquilizing antipsychotic drugs (e.g. Zyprexa and Risperdal) are now the highest grossing class of medication in the United States ($16 billion in 2010); a major reason for this, according to theJournal of the American Medical Association in 2010, is that many children receiving antipsychotic drugs have nonpsychotic diagnoses such as ODD or some other disruptive disorder (this especially true of Medicaid-covered pediatric patients).\n\n3. Schools That Educate for Compliance and Not for Democracy. Upon accepting the New York City Teacher of the Year Award on January 31, 1990, John Taylor Gatto upset many in attendance by stating: \u201cThe truth is that schools don\u2019t really teach anything except how to obey orders. This is a great mystery to me because thousands of humane, caring people work in schools as teachers and aides and administrators, but the abstract logic of the institution overwhelms their individual contributions.\u201d A generation ago, the problem of compulsory schooling as a vehicle for an authoritarian society was widely discussed, but as this problem has gotten worse, it is seldom discussed.\n\nThe nature of most classrooms, regardless of the subject matter, socializes students to be passive and directed by others, to follow orders, to take seriously the rewards and punishments of authorities, to pretend to care about things they don\u2019t care about, and that they are impotent to affect their situation. A teacher can lecture about democracy, but schools are essentially undemocratic places, and so democracy is not what is instilled in students. Jonathan Kozol in The Night Is Dark and I Am Far from Home focused on how school breaks us from courageous actions. Kozol explains how our schools teach us a kind of \u201cinert concern\u201d in which \u201ccaring\u201d\u2014in and of itself and without risking the consequences of actual action\u2014is considered \u201cethical.\u201d School teaches us that we are \u201cmoral and mature\u201d if we politely assert our concerns, but the essence of school\u2014its demand for compliance\u2014teaches us not to act in a friction-causing manner.\n\n4. \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d and \u201cRace to the Top.\u201d The corporatocracy has figured out a way to make our already authoritarian schools even more authoritarian. Democrat-Republican bipartisanship has resulted in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, NAFTA, the PATRIOT Act, the War on Drugs, the Wall Street bailout, and educational policies such as \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d and \u201cRace to the Top.\u201d These policies are essentially standardized-testing tyranny that creates fear, which is antithetical to education for a democratic society. Fear forces students and teachers to constantly focus on the demands of test creators; it crushes curiosity, critical thinking, questioning authority, and challenging and resisting illegitimate authority. In a more democratic and less authoritarian society, one would evaluate the effectiveness of a teacher not by corporatocracy-sanctioned standardized tests but by asking students, parents, and a community if a teacher is inspiring students to be more curious, to read more, to learn independently, to enjoy thinking critically, to question authorities, and to challenge illegitimate authorities.\n\n5. Shaming Young People Who Take Education\u2014But Not Their Schooling\u2014Seriously. In a 2006 survey in the United States, it was found that 40 percent of children between first and third grade read every day, but by fourth grade, that rate declined to 29 percent. Despite the anti-educational impact of standard schools, children and their parents are increasingly propagandized to believe that disliking school means disliking learning. That was not always the case in the United States. Mark Twain famously said, \u201cI never let my schooling get in the way of my education.\u201d Toward the end of Twain\u2019s life in 1900, only 6 percent of Americans graduated high school. Today, approximately 85 percent of Americans graduate high school, but this is good enough for Barack Obama who told us in 2009, \u201cAnd dropping out of high school is no longer an option. It\u2019s not just quitting on yourself, it\u2019s quitting on your country.\u201d\n\nThe more schooling Americans get, however, the more politically ignorant they are of America\u2019s ongoing class war, and the more incapable they are of challenging the ruling class. In the 1880s and 1890s, American farmers with little or no schooling created a Populist movement that organized America\u2019s largest-scale working people\u2019s cooperative, formed a People\u2019s Party that received 8 percent of the vote in 1892 presidential election, designed a \u201csubtreasury\u201d plan (that had it been implemented would have allowed easier credit for farmers and broken the power of large banks) and sent 40,000 lecturers across America to articulate it, and evidenced all kinds of sophisticated political ideas, strategies and tactics absent today from America\u2019s well-schooled population. Today, Americans who lack college degrees are increasingly shamed as \u201closers\u201d; however, Gore Vidal and George Carlin, two of America\u2019s most astute and articulate critics of the corporatocracy, never went to college, and Carlin dropped out of school in the ninth grade.\n\n6. The Normalization of Surveillance. The fear of being surveilled makes a population easier to control. While the National Security Agency (NSA) has received publicity for monitoring American citizen\u2019s email and phone conversations, and while employer surveillance has become increasingly common in the United States, young Americans have become increasingly acquiescent to corporatocracy surveillance because, beginning at a young age, surveillance is routine in their lives. Parents routinely check Web sites for their kid\u2019s latest test grades and completed assignments, and just like employers, are monitoring their children\u2019s computers and Facebook pages. Some parents use the GPS in their children\u2019s cell phones to track their whereabouts, and other parents have video cameras in their homes. Increasingly, I talk with young people who lack the confidence that they can even pull off a party when their parents are out of town, and so how much confidence are they going to have about pulling off a democratic movement below the radar of authorities?\n\n7. Television. In 2009, the Nielsen Company reported that TV viewing in the United States is at an all-time high if one includes the following \u201cthree screens\u201d: a television set, a laptop/personal computer, and a cell phone. American children average eight hours a day on TV, video games, movies, the Internet, cell phones, iPods, and other technologies (not including school-related use). Many progressives are concerned about the concentrated control of content by the corporate media, but the mere act of watching TV\u2014regardless of the programming\u2014is the primary pacifying agent (private-enterprise prisons have recognized that providing inmates with cable television can be a more economical method to keep them quiet and subdued than it would be to hire more guards).\n\nTelevision is a dream come true for an authoritarian society: those with the most money own most of what people see; fear-based television programming makes people more afraid and distrustful of one another, which is good for the ruling elite who depend on a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy; TV isolates people so they are not joining together to create resistance to authorities; and regardless of the programming, TV viewers\u2019 brainwaves slow down, transforming them closer to a hypnotic state that makes it difficult to think critically. While playing a video games is not as zombifying as passively viewing TV, such games have become for many boys and young men their only experience of potency, and this \u201cvirtual potency\u201d is certainly no threat to the ruling elite.\n\n8. Fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism. American culture offers young Americans the \u201cchoices\u201d of fundamentalist religion and fundamentalist consumerism. All varieties of fundamentalism narrow one\u2019s focus and inhibit critical thinking. While some progressives are fond of calling fundamentalist religion the \u201copiate of the masses,\u201d they too often neglect the pacifying nature of America\u2019s other major fundamentalism. Fundamentalist consumerism pacifies young Americans in a variety of ways. Fundamentalist consumerism destroys self-reliance, creating people who feel completely dependent on others and who are thus more likely to turn over decision-making power to authorities, the precise mind-set that the ruling elite loves to see. A fundamentalist consumer culture legitimizes advertising, propaganda, and all kinds of manipulations, including lies; and when a society gives legitimacy to lies and manipulativeness, it destroys the capacity of people to trust one another and form democratic movements. Fundamentalist consumerism also promotes self-absorption, which makes it difficult for the solidarity necessary for democratic movements.\n\nThese are not the only aspects of our culture that are subduing young Americans and crushing their resistance to domination. The food-industrial complex has helped create an epidemic of childhood obesity, depression, and passivity. The prison-industrial complex keeps young anti-authoritarians \u201cin line\u201d (now by the fear that they may come before judges such as the two Pennsylvania ones who took $2.6 million from private-industry prisons to ensure that juveniles were incarcerated). As Ralph Waldo Emerson observed: \u201cAll our things are right and wrong together. The wave of evil washes all our institutions alike.\u201d"}, "http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/chomsky-boston-bombings-gave-americans-taste-terrorism-us-inflicts-abroad-every": {"title": "Chomsky: The Boston Bombings Gave Americans a Taste of the Terrorism the U.S. Inflicts Abroad Every Day", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/chomsky-boston-bombings-gave-americans-taste-terrorism-us-inflicts-abroad-every", "text": "April is usually a cheerful month in New England, with the first signs of spring, and the harsh winter at last receding. Not this year.\n\nThere are few in Boston who were not touched in some way by the marathon bombings on April 15 and the tense week that followed. Several friends of mine were at the finish line when the bombs went off. Others live close to where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the second suspect, was captured. The young police officer Sean Collier was murdered right outside my office building.\n\nIt's rare for privileged Westerners to see, graphically, what many others experience daily - for example, in a remote village in Yemen, the same week as the marathon bombings.\n\nOn April 23, Yemeni activist and journalist Farea Al-Muslimi, who had studied at an American high school, testified before a US Senate committee that right after the marathon bombings, a drone strike in his home village in Yemen killed its target.\n\nThe strike terrorized the villagers, turning them into enemies of the United States - something that years of jihadi propaganda had failed to accomplish.\n\nHis neighbors had admired the US, Al-Muslimi told the committee, but \"Now, however, when they think of America, they think of the fear they feel at the drones over their heads. What radicals had previously failed to achieve in my village, one drone strike accomplished in an instant.\"\n\nRack up another triumph for President Obama's global assassination program, which creates hatred of the United States and threats to its citizens more rapidly than it kills people who are suspected of posing a possible danger to us someday.\n\nThe target of the Yemeni village assassination, which was carried out to induce maximum terror in the population, was well-known and could easily have been apprehended, Al-Muslimi said. This is another familiar feature of the global terror operations.\n\nThere was no direct way to prevent the Boston murders. There are some easy ways to prevent likely future ones: by not inciting them. That's also true of another case of a suspect murdered, his body disposed of without autopsy, when he could easily have been apprehended and brought to trial: Osama bin Laden.\n\nThis murder too had consequences. To locate bin Laden, the CIA launched a fraudulent vaccination campaign in a poor neighborhood, then switched it, uncompleted, to a richer area where the suspect was thought to be.\n\nThe CIA operation violated fundamental principles as old as the Hippocratic oath. It also endangered health workers associated with a polio vaccination program in Pakistan, several of whom were abducted and killed, prompting the UN to withdraw its anti-polio team.\n\nThe CIA ruse also will lead to the deaths of unknown numbers of Pakistanis who have been deprived of protection from polio because they fear that foreign killers may still be exploiting vaccination programs.\n\nColumbia University health scientist Leslie Roberts estimated that 100,000 cases of polio may follow this incident; he told Scientific American that \"people would say this disease, this crippled child is because the US was so crazy to get Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nAnd they may choose to react, as aggrieved people sometimes do, in ways that will cause their tormentors consternation and outrage.\n\nEven more severe consequences were narrowly averted. The US Navy SEALs were under orders to fight their way out if necessary. Pakistan has a well-trained army, committed to defending the state. Had the invaders been confronted, Washington would not have left them to their fate. Rather, the full force of the US killing machine might have been used to extricate them, quite possibly leading to nuclear war.\n\nThere is a long and highly instructive history showing the willingness of state authorities to risk the fate of their populations, sometimes severely, for the sake of their policy objectives, not least the most powerful state in the world. We ignore it at our peril.\n\nThere is no need to ignore it right now. A remedy is investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill's just-published Dirty Wars: The World Is a Battleground.\n\nIn chilling detail, Scahill describes the effects on the ground of US military operations, terror strikes from the air (drones), and the exploits of the secret army of the executive branch, the Joint Special Operations Command, which rapidly expanded under President George W. Bush, then became a weapon of choice for President Obama.\n\nWe should bear in mind an astute observation by the author and activist Fred Branfman, who almost single-handedly exposed the true horrors of the US \"secret wars\" in Laos in the 1960s, and their extensions beyond.\n\nConsidering today's JSOC-CIA-drones/killing machines, Branfman reminds us about the Senate testimony in 1969 of Monteagle Stearns, US deputy chief of mission in Laos from 1969 to 1972.\n\nAsked why the US rapidly escalated its bombing after President Johnson had ordered a halt over North Vietnam in November 1968, Stearns said, \"Well, we had all those planes sitting around and couldn't just let them stay there with nothing to do.\" So we can use them to drive poor peasants in remote villages of northern Laos into caves to survive, even penetrating within the caves with our advanced technology.\n\nJSOC and the drones are a self-generating terror machine that will grow and expand, meanwhile creating new potential targets as they sweep much of the world. And the executive won't want them just \"sitting around.\"\n\nIt wouldn't hurt to contemplate another slice of history, at the dawn of the 20th century.\n\nIn his book \"Policing America's Empire: The United States, the Philippines and the Rise of the Surveillance State,\" the historian Alfred McCoy explores in depth the US pacification of the Philippines after an invasion that killed hundreds of thousands through savagery and torture.\n\nThe conquerors established a sophisticated surveillance and control system, using the most advanced technology of the day to ensure obedience, with consequences for the Philippines that reach to the present.\n\nAnd as McCoy demonstrates, it wasn't long before the successes found their way home, where such methods were employed to control the domestic population - in softer ways to be sure, but not very attractive ones.\n\nWe can expect the same. The dangers of unexamined and unregulated monopoly power, particularly in the state executive, are hardly news. The right reaction is not passive acquiescence."}, "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/07/18/a-christian-extremist-shot-a-trans-woman-in-the-face-but-indiana-doesnt-call-that-a-hate-crime/": {"title": "A Christian Extremist Shot a Trans Woman In the Face, but Indiana Doesn\u2019t Call That a Hate Crime", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/07/18/a-christian-extremist-shot-a-trans-woman-in-the-face-but-indiana-doesnt-call-that-a-hate-crime/", "text": "Last week, a Christian extremist shot a transgender woman in the face at her place of work \u2014 and because it happened in Indiana, it\u2019s not considered a hate crime.\n\nCrystal Cash, 55, was shot in the face while working at the cosmetics business she runs in Evansville, Indiana. Cash is currently unable to speak, but through writing was able to help identify her attacker as Gerald Duane Lewis. Lewis also yelled an anti-gay slur at Cash before shooting her.\n\nViolence against transgender women is an epidemic, and in incidents like this, it\u2019s obvious that anti-LGBT bias is at play. Still, the police investigation of the incident has been murky, which is likely related to the fact that Cash is a trans woman and that there are no hate crimes laws on the books to protect against bias-based violence in Indiana:\n\nThe case has been complicated by the police \u2014 who have implied that Cash is a prostitute \u2014 and by whether her assailant, identified as Gerald Duane Lewis (AKA Gadiell Ben Israel), belongs to an organization identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as a hate group. The SPLC identifies Lewis/Israel\u2019s church as violently anti-Semitic and anti-LGBT. The Israel United in Christ Church, on its Tumblr page, denounces interracial marriage as a sin and an abomination, and also commands its followers not to vote. In recent posts, it commented upon a recent house fire that killed seven children that it was a lesson to be learned about \u201cdefiling the sabbath.\u201d The organization posted a note on its website denying that Lewis was a current member of the group.\n\nTransgender women are often mistreated in the criminal justice system, whether they are being accused of a crime or have been victimized. They are frequently assumed to be sex workers and treated poorly, or their gender identities are not recognized. Both of these things happened to Cash:\n\nWhen the Evansville Courier-Press reported on the arrest, it paraphrased the police report: \u201cInvestigators noted in the arrest affidavit that Cash operates a known massage parlor in one of the spaces in the building where the shooting happened. Cash is a frequent poster on Backpage.com, an adult services website that police have expressed concern about in the past. [\u2026] Johnny Dickens, Cash\u2019s brother, says that his sister has been in a \u201ccommitted relationship for twenty years.\u201d He alleges that police are trying to portray his sister as a prostitute rather than as a transgender businesswoman who was targeted by a Christian extremist. According to Courier news reports, there was initial confusion after the events as police reported that a \u201cman\u201d had been shot. Cash was able to describe the suspect in writing, whom she said was wearing an \u201cIsraeli-Christian\u201d tee shirt. Lewis/Israel is being held on $5 million bond/$500,000 cash for attempted murder, robbery, and carrying a handgun without a permit.\n\nThis is where it would be helpful for the police to publicly acknowledge that Cash\u2019s attacker committed a hate crime. Hate crimes don\u2019t just target a person, but an entire class of people. They\u2019re meant to intimidate, like small-scale terrorist attacks that send a threatening message to an entire community.\n\nHate crimes legislation, therefore, recognizes the multifaceted ways an act of violence can affect an entire community, and helps protect other members of that community who may be at risk. President Barack Obama even prioritized expanding hate crimes legislation toward the beginning of his presidency.\n\nDespite all this information, police are not charging Lewis with a hate crime because Indiana is one of only five states in the country that do not have hate crimes protections in place. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2014 who might just be our next Vice President \u2014 is a major opponent of hate crimes legislation:\n\n\u201cThe president has used his position as commander in chief to advance a radical social agenda, when he should have used it to advance legislation that would unequivocally support our troops,\u201d said [then-U.S. Rep.] Mike Pence, R-Ind., chairman of the House Republican Conference. Pence also argued that the law could be used to curb free speech rights, such as with religions that consider homosexuality a sin.\n\nProtecting people who are at risk has been a federal concern for at least the last seven years, but in states like Indiana, efforts to implement hate crimes laws are continually thwarted. This horrifying event could be a snapshot of the \u201cvalues\u201d that would govern a Mike Pence vice presidency: no recognition of populations that are routinely targeted, and no justice for those who experience such violence. Here\u2019s hoping for a speedy recovery for Cash, and a speedy demise for the Trump/Pence campaign."}, "http://nypost.com/2014/07/13/nypd-detective-in-coma-after-subway-platform-assault/": {"title": "Cop in coma after subway station assault", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://nypost.com/2014/07/13/nypd-detective-in-coma-after-subway-platform-assault/", "text": "Cops are hunting for this man in a vicious assault on an off-duty NYPD detective in a Midtown subway station.\n\nOfficer Adrian Delfaus, 29, suffered a serious head injury when the man allegedly clobbered him during a dispute involving a panhandler in the 6-train station at 23rd Street at around 6:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nDelfaus was in a medically induced coma before doctors upgraded his condition to stable Sunday afternoon.\n\nHis mother said he was out of the coma and could be released from Bellevue Hospital as early as Monday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing well,\u201d she said after visiting him Sunday. \u201cWe just hope they catch the guy.\u201d\n\nThe NYPD released a sketch of the attacker, who they say is in his 40s, about 5-foot-9 and 200 pounds.

Iraqi forces take Kirkuk, while Syrian Democratic Forces seize Raqqa. Ai Weiwei releases a film about refugees, while refugees continues to trek across the Sahara Desert and across the lip that divides Myanmar from Bangladesh. Puerto Rico still has no power, while a cyclonic storm hits Ireland. U.S. troops die in Niger, a massive bomb kills hundreds in Mogadishu (Somalia), the Taliban attacks in Paktia and Ghazni (Afghanistan). A sensation of dread fills the air over the potential of another illegal American war, this time against Iran or North Korea or both.\n\nIt is difficult to digest. There seems to be too much sorrow, too much pain, too little understanding of how to turn these stories from tragedy into hope.\n\nIt would seem obvious that the defeat of ISIS in Raqqa should allow for celebration. But even here, for those who follow this story, there is hesitation. That \u2018victory\u2019 comes paired with the events in Kirkuk, showing that the aftermath of the defeat of ISIS is going to be as complex and difficult as the war against ISIS. Borders are shifting, States are consolidating their territory. Will the Syrian Arab Army now move north towards Raqqa and clash with the Syrian Democratic Forces, just as the Turkish Army might move south to dampen the ambitions of the Kurds who are the dominant power in the Syrian Democratic Forces? Will the Kurdish Question\u2014so long suppressed\u2014be the next power keg to explode across fragile West Asia?\n\nWhat to make of the deaths in Somalia and in Afghanistan, shocking numbers dead, shocking that they have made so little dent in the consciousness of the West. It is hard for the West to acknowledge the bare humanity of the dead Somalis and the dead Afghans. Their names have not been noted, their lives difficult to understand. It is as if there is wall that separates our human species being, those who live in zones of great war and tragedy are separated from those who live with the illusion of peace, in countries that produce the conditions for war but deny that they have a hand in it. So easy for the Western public to ignore the bombings in Afghanistan, a country wrecked most recently by a Western war.\n\nEven easier to ignore Somalia, whose descent into warlordism is fundamentally linked to overfishing of corporate trawlers inside Somalia\u2019s territorial waters and interventions by foreign powers (including the United States). None of this complicity matters. All that one registers is that there were deaths there, a passivity that suggests that there will always be death there and that they have cultural problems that they have to sort out.\n\nThere will never be hashtags for these Afghans and Somalis, nor indeed will their flags fly anywhere (what do their flags even look like?). It is easier for a Western consumer of the news to imagine themselves at a caf\u00e9 in Paris or on the Ramblas in Barcelona; attacks there cut to the core, reflect the humanity at one side of the division. Harder to imagine being in central Mogadishu or at the district administration building in Ghazni. Those who are there are on the other side of the international division of humanity.\n\nWhat to make of the refugee crisis, the flood that will continue to grow and bedevil the West? These refugees are again anonymous bodies, huddled together, desperation as their motif. There is something timeless about Salah Jaheen\u2019s poem on a Palestinian refugee, \u2018Caging his suffering within his ribs/Withered and starving/Sitting around doing nothing.\u2019\n\nBut this futility is not enough. Jaheen looks at the refugees and writes, \u2018and in the line, there are a thousand families/and five hundred thousand sorrows\u2019. Sorrow is what strikes the poet, but surely there is more there, as any of us who have written stories about refugees know. There is expectation and anticipation, for if these did not exist in the minds of the refugee, then the refugee would not have bothered with the long trek.\n\nThe fact of the refugee migration and of war is undeniable. But what is bewildering is why the refugees are on the move and why there are wars. It is always convenient to rest the blame on culture: the Shias and the Sunnis do not get along or the Turks hate the Kurds or that Islam has a violent streak that cannot be moderated. These are the reflexive, and racist, explanations for a reality that should be understood not only through cultural explanations, but also through explanations that are available and yet ignored.\n\nOn Monday, the UN\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) celebrated its founding in 1945 with World Food Day. Last month, the FAO released a sobering report that has received far too little attention. In its report, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017, the FAO showed that global hunger has risen for the first time in a decade, with its figures showing that 815 million people around the planet suffer from hunger. That\u2019s more than 1 in 10 people. The figure has risen by 38 million from last year. The UN\u2019s World Food Program called this report\u2019s findings an \u2018indictment of humanity\u2019.\n\nBuried in the report is an astounding number: that 489 million of those who are chronically food insecure and malnourished live in countries affected by conflict. That means the vast bulk of those who are starving live in conflict zones. Three quarters of children who are stunted by age five, who suffer from acute malnutrition, live in these same areas, mostly West Asia, North Africa and Central Asia in a belt of dry land that has been susceptible to climate change as much as to the seemingly endless war.\n\nIndeed, the FAO finds that the increase in hunger is \u2018largely due to the proliferation of violent conflicts and climate-related shocks\u2019. In Iraq, for instance, two districts, Ninewa and Salah al-Din, used to produce a third of the country\u2019s wheat and 40 percent of its barley. Today, thanks to the illegal US war on Iraq in 2003, the food production in the region is severely compromised. In Ninewa, up to 68% of the land used for wheat cultivation has been compromised, while up to 57% of the land for barley is no longer usable. Famines in South Sudan and Yemen are a direct consequence of war, with Somalia itself experiencing famine as a result of war and drought, with six million people of its fourteen million in dire need of food. Boko Haram\u2019s growth in northern Nigeria and around the Lake Chad basin is directly linked to the desertification of the region.\n\nWar certainly produces hunger, but hunger in turn produces war. The pressure on the world\u2019s agriculture from climate-change is now an acknowledged fact. But this is not enough. The descent of agro-business firms, with the advantage of intellectual property rights behind them, has struck against small farmers with a vengeance. There are any number of reports that show that the crisis of hunger can only be solved by the encouragement of small farms, whose farmers are themselves victims of the hunger crisis (three quarters of the world\u2019s hungry live in rural areas). Even Bill Gates has suggested that the solution to the hunger crisis\u2014and therefore to some of the instability that has led to so many wars \u2014is the small farmer. But how can the small farmers emerge as the saviors when they are under immense pressure from capitalist agriculture that has produced \u2018efficiencies\u2019 along the global commodity chain that advantage what they do over what the small farmer does? These capitalist agricultural firms process food beyond nutrition and are thereby responsible for the obesity crisis in the West, the mirror image of the hunger crisis in the Global South. Will there be a spotlight shone on their activities?\n\nThe West always imagines itself to be the most benevolent. But it was not western countries that hastened to send assistance to Mogadishu. Medical staff rushed from Djibouti and Turkey, with a Turkish air ambulance ferrying the most injured back to Istanbul for treatment.\n\nThe West\u2019s benevolence is now measured in the destructive force of its agro-business and arms sales. The moral compass revolves around Monsanto seeds and Sikorsky helicopters. Trump will send more troops into Somalia. That will be the Western contribution to the hurricane that is sweeping across the planet."}, "http://www.republicreport.org/2012/marijuana-lobby-illegal/?campaign=twitter": {"title": "The Top Five Special Interest Groups Lobbying To Keep Marijuana Illegal", "keywords": ["david halperin", " for profit colleges"], "url": "http://www.republicreport.org/2012/marijuana-lobby-illegal/?campaign=twitter", "text": "Last year, over 850,000 people in America were arrested for marijuana-related crimes. Despite public opinion, the medical community, and human rights experts all moving in favor of relaxing marijuana prohibition laws, little has changed in terms of policy.\n\nThere have been many great books and articles detailing the history of the drug war. Part of America\u2019s fixation with keeping the leafy green plant illegal is rooted in cultural and political clashes from the past.\n\nHowever, we at Republic Report think it\u2019s worth showing that there are entrenched interest groups that are spending large sums of money to keep our broken drug laws on the books:\n\n1.) Police Unions: Police departments across the country have become dependent on federal drug war grants to finance their budget. In March, we published a story revealing that a police union lobbyist in California coordinated the effort to defeat Prop 19, a ballot measure in 2010 to legalize marijuana, while helping his police department clients collect tens of millions in federal marijuana-eradication grants. And it\u2019s not just in California. Federal lobbying disclosures show that other police union lobbyists have pushed for stiffer penalties for marijuana-related crimes nationwide. 2.) Private Prisons Corporations: Private prison corporations make millions by incarcerating people who have been imprisoned for drug crimes, including marijuana. As Republic Report\u2019s Matt Stoller noted last year, Corrections Corporation of America, one of the largest for-profit prison companies, revealed in a regulatory filing that continuing the drug war is part in parcel to their business strategy. Prison companies have spent millions bankrolling pro-drug war politicians and have used secretive front groups, like the American Legislative Exchange Council, to pass harsh sentencing requirements for drug crimes. 3.) Alcohol and Beer Companies: Fearing competition for the dollars Americans spend on leisure, alcohol and tobacco interests have lobbied to keep marijuana out of reach. For instance, the California Beer & Beverage Distributors contributed campaign contributions to a committee set up to prevent marijuana from being legalized and taxed. 4.) Pharmaceutical Corporations: Like the sin industries listed above, pharmaceutical interests would like to keep marijuana illegal so American don\u2019t have the option of cheap medical alternatives to their products. Howard Wooldridge, a retired police officer who now lobbies the government to relax marijuana prohibition laws, told Republic Report that next to police unions, the \u201csecond biggest opponent on Capitol Hill is big PhRMA\u201d because marijuana can replace \u201ceverything from Advil to Vicodin and other expensive pills.\u201d 5.) Prison Guard Unions: Prison guard unions have a vested interest in keeping people behind bars just like for-profit prison companies. In 2008, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association spent a whopping $1 million to defeat a measure that would have \u201creduced sentences and parole times for nonviolent drug offenders while emphasizing drug treatment over prison.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Why Can\u2019t You Smoke Pot?

The ICJ ruled in favor of Nicaragua and against the United States and awarded reparations to Nicaragua. The ICJ held that the U.S. had violated international law by supporting the Contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua's harbors. The United States refused to participate in the proceedings after the Court rejected its argument that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The U.S. also blocked enforcement of the judgment by the United Nations Security Council and thereby prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any compensation.[2] Nicaragua, under the later, post-FSLN government of Violeta Chamorro, withdrew the complaint from the court in September 1992 following a repeal of the law which had required the country to seek compensation.[3]\n\nThe Court found in its verdict that the United States was \"in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State\", \"not to intervene in its affairs\", \"not to violate its sovereignty\", \"not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce\", and \"in breach of its obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the Parties signed at Managua on 21 January 1956.\"\n\nThe Court had 16 final decisions upon which it voted. In Statement 9, the Court stated that while the U.S. encouraged human rights violations by the Contras by the manual entitled Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare, this did not make such acts attributable to the U.S.[4]\n\nThe first armed intervention by the United States in Nicaragua occurred under President Taft. In 1909, he ordered the overthrow of Nicaraguan President Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya. During August and September 1912, a contingent of 2300 U.S. Marines landed at the port of Corinto and occupied Le\u00f3n and the railway line to Granada. A pro-U.S. government was formed under the occupation. The 1914 Bryan\u2013Chamorro Treaty granted perpetual canal rights to the U.S. in Nicaragua and was signed ten days before the U.S.-operated Panama Canal opened for use, thus preventing anyone from building a competing canal in Nicaragua without U.S. permission.[5]\n\nIn 1927, under Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino, a major peasant uprising was launched against both the U.S. occupation and the Nicaraguan establishment. In 1933, the Marines withdrew and left the Nicaraguan National Guard in charge of internal security and elections. In 1934, Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda, the head of the National Guard, ordered his forces to capture and murder Sandino. In 1937, Somoza assumed the presidency, while still in control of the National Guard, and established a dictatorship that his family controlled until 1979.[6]\n\nThe downfall of the regime is attributed to its embezzlement of millions of dollars in foreign aid that was given to the country in response to the devastating 1972 earthquake. Many moderate supporters of the dictatorship began abandoning it in the face of growing revolutionary sentiment. The Sandinista (FSLN) movement organized relief, began to expand its influence and assumed the leadership of the revolution.[7] A popular uprising brought the FSLN to power in 1979. The United States had long been opposed to the socialist FSLN, and after the revolution the Carter administration moved quickly to support the Somocistas with financial and material aid. When Ronald Reagan took office, he augmented the direct support to an anti-Sandinista group, called the Contras, which included factions loyal to the former dictatorship. When Congress prohibited further funding to the Contras, Oliver North continued the funding through arms sales that were also prohibited by Congress.[8]\n\nNicaragua demanded that all such actions cease and that the United States had an obligation to pay reparations to the government for damage to their people, property, and economy.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the United States, the defaulting party, was the only member that put forward arguments against the validity of the judgment of the court, arguing that it passed a decision that it \"had neither the jurisdiction nor the competence to render.\" Members that sided with the United States in opposing Nicaragua's claims did not challenge the court's jurisdiction, its findings, nor the substantive merits of the case.[9] Pursuant to general and customary international law, the United States has an obligation to Nicaragua to respect the sovereignty of Nicaragua. ii. Pursuant to general and customary international law, the United States has an obligation to Nicaragua not to use force or the threat of force against Nicaragua. iii. Pursuant to general and customary international law, the United States has an obligation to Nicaragua not to intervene in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.\n\nThe very long judgment first listed 291 points, among them that the United States had been involved in the \"unlawful use of force\". The alleged violations included attacks on Nicaraguan facilities and naval vessels, the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the invasion of Nicaraguan air space, and the training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying of forces (the \"Contras\") and seeking to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. This was followed by the statements that the judges voted on.[10]\n\nThe court found evidence of an arms flow between Nicaragua and insurgents in El Salvador between 1979-81. However, there was not enough evidence to show that the Nicaraguan government was imputable for this or that the US response was proportional. The court also found that certain transborder incursions into the territory of Guatemala and Costa Rica, in 1982, 1983 and 1984, were imputable to the Government of Nicaragua. However, neither Guatemala nor Costa Rica had made any request for US intervention; El Salvador did in 1984, well after the US had intervened unilaterally.[2]\n\n\"As regards El Salvador, the Court considers that in customary international law the provision of arms to the opposition in another State does not constitute an armed attack on that State. As regards Honduras and Costa Rica, the Court states that, in the absence of sufficient information as to the transborder incursions into the territory of those two States from Nicaragua, it is difficult to decide whether they amount, singly or collectively, to an armed attack by Nicaragua. The Court finds that neither these incursions nor the alleged supply of arms may be relied on as justifying the exercise of the right of collective self-defence.\"[11]\n\nRegarding human rights violations by the Contras, \"The Court has to determine whether the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was such that it would be right to equate the Contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government. The Court considers that the evidence available to it is insufficient to demonstrate the total dependence of the contras on United States aid. A partial dependency, the exact extent of which the Court cannot establish, may be inferred from the fact that the leaders were selected by the United States, and from other factors such as the organisation, training and equipping of the force, planning of operations, the choosing of targets and the operational support provided. There is no clear evidence that the United States actually exercised such a degree of control as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf... Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the Contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law. For the United States to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had effective control of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.\"[11]\n\nThe Court concluded that the United States, despite its objections, was subject to the Court's jurisdiction. The Court had ruled on November 26 by 11 votes to one that it had jurisdiction in the case on the basis of either Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (i.e. compulsory jurisdiction) or the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Nicaragua. The Charter provides that, in case of doubt, it is for the Court itself to decide whether it has jurisdiction, and that each member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the Court. The Court also ruled by unanimity that the present case was admissible.[12] The United States then announced that it had \"decided not to participate in further proceedings in this case.\" About a year after the Court's jurisdictional decision, the United States took the further, radical step of withdrawing its consent to the Court's compulsory jurisdiction, ending its previous 40 year legal commitment to binding international adjudication. The Declaration of acceptance of the general compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice terminated after a 6-month notice of termination delivered by the Secretary of State to the United Nations on October 7, 1985. [13]\n\nAlthough the Court called on the United States to \"cease and to refrain\" from the unlawful use of force against Nicaragua and stated that the US was \"in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to use force against another state\" and ordered it to pay reparations, the United States refused to comply.[14] As a permanent member of the Security Council, the U.S. has been able to block any enforcement mechanism attempted by Nicaragua.[15] On November 3, 1986 the United Nations General Assembly passed, by a vote of 94-3 (El Salvador, Israel and the US voted against), a non-binding[16] resolution urging the US to comply.[17]\n\nOn June 27, 1986, the Court made the following ruling:\n\nThe ruling did in many ways clarify issues surrounding prohibition of the use of force and the right of self-defence.[18] Arming and training the Contra was found to be in breach with principles of non-intervention and prohibition of use of force, as was laying mines in Nicaraguan territorial waters.\n\nNicaragua's dealings with the armed opposition in El Salvador, although it might be considered a breach with the principle of non-intervention and the prohibition of use of force, did not constitute \"an armed attack\", which is the wording in article 51 justifying the right of self-defence.\n\nThe Court considered also the United States claim to be acting in collective self-defence of El Salvador and found the conditions for this not reached as El Salvador never requested the assistance of the United States on the grounds of self-defence.\n\nIn regards to laying mines, \"...the laying of mines in the waters of another State without any warning or notification is not only an unlawful act but also a breach of the principles of humanitarian law underlying the Hague Convention No. VIII of 1907.\"\n\nJudge Schwebel's dissent was twice as long as the actual judgment. Judge Schwebel argued that the Sandinista government came to power with support of foreign intervention similar to what it was now complaining about. He argued that the Sandinista government achieved international recognition and received large amounts of foreign aid in exchange for commitments they subsequently violated. He cited evidence that the Sandinista government had indeed supported the rebels in El Salvador and noted that Nicaragua\u2019s own CIA witness contradicted their assertions that they had never at any point supported the rebels in El Salvador. The CIA witness said that there was no evidence of weapon shipments since early 1981, but Schwebel argued that he could not credibly explained why opponents of Contra aid such as Congressman Boland, who also saw the evidence, believed that weapon shipments were ongoing. He further argued that Daniel Ortega publicly admitted such shipments in statements in 1985 and 1986. Furthermore, there was no dispute that the leadership of the rebels operated in Nicaragua from time to time.\n\nHe stated that in August 1981 the U.S. offered to resume aid to Nicaragua and to not support regime change in exchange for Nicaraguan commitments to not support the rebels in El Salvador. These proposals were rejected by the Sandinistas, and judge Schwebel argued that the U.S. was entitled to take action in collective self-defense with El Salvador by authorizing Contra aid in December 1981. He stated that further U.S. proposals to resolve the issue made in early 1982 were also ignored by the Sandinistas. The Sandinista government in 1983 began advancing proposals in which it would undertake not to support the rebels, but Schwebel noted that these were coupled with demands that the U.S. cease supporting the lawful government of El Salvador. The judge noted that since early 1985 the U.S. had increasingly made regime change a primary objective but argued this was not inconsistent with self-defense because it was reasonable to believe that Nicaragua would not maintain any commitments unless Sandinista power was diluted.\n\nThe judge said that both sides of the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador had committed atrocities. He said the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors was unlawful in regard to third parties, but not Nicaragua.[19]\n\nThe first witness called by Nicaragua was Nicaragua's first Vice Minister of the Interior, Commander Luis Carrion. Commander Carrion had overall responsibility for state security and was in charge of all government operations in the \"principal war zone\". He was responsible for monitoring United States involvement in military and paramilitary activities against Nicaragua, directing Nicaragua's military and intelligence efforts against the contra guerrillas.\n\nCommander Carrion began by explaining the condition of the contras prior to United States' aid in December 1981. Commander Carrion stated that the contras consisted of insignificant bands of poorly armed and poorly organized members of Somoza's National Guard, who carried out uncoordinated border raids and rustled cattle (presumably for food).\n\nIn December 1981, the U.S. Congress authorized an initial appropriation of 19 million dollars to finance paramilitary operations in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America. Because of this aid, Commander Carrion stated that the contras began to become centralized and received both training and weapons from the CIA. During 1982 the contra guerrillas engaged the Sandinista armed forces in a series of hit and run border raids and carried out a number of sabotage operations including:\n\nThe United States Central Intelligence Agency, and Argentine military officers financed by the CIA, were engaged in the training of the contra forces. The guerrillas received both basic infantry training as well as training in specialized sabotage and demolition for \"special operation groups\".\n\nThe U.S. Congress apportioned new funds for the contras to the amount of $30 million at the end of 1982. This made it possible for the contra forces to launch a military offensive against Nicaragua. According to Commander Carrion, the offensive known as \"C Plan\" had the objective of capturing the Nicaraguan border town of Jalapa in order to install a provisional government, which could receive international recognition. This plan failed.\n\nAfter the failure of the Jalapa offensive the contras changed their tactics from frontal assaults to economic warfare against State farms, coffee plantations, grain storage centers, road junctions, etc.\n\nThe CIA began to support the contras by setting up and coordinating a communications and logistical system. The CIA supplied aircraft and the construction of airfields in the Honduran border area next to Nicaragua. This allowed the contras to carry out deep penetration raids into the more developed and populated areas of the Nicaraguan interior. U.S. Army engineers created this airfield. The purpose of these deep penetration attacks upon economic targets was to weaken the Nicaraguan economy, causing a shortages of goods.\n\nAs a part of its training program for the contras, the CIA prepared and distributed a manual entitled Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare. This manual included instructions in the \"use of implicit and explicit terror\", and in the \"selective use of violence for propaganda effects\". Commander Carrion explained that the manual was given to the Contras, \"All of these terrorist instructions have the main purpose of alienating the population from the Government through creating a climate of terror and fear, so that nobody would dare support the Government\". The manual calls for the \"neutralization\" (i.e. assassination) of Sandinista local government officials, judges, etc. for purposes of intimidation. It was openly admitted by the President Reagan in a press conference that the manual had been prepared by a CIA contract employee.\n\nAfter the United States Congress approved an additional $24 million aid to the contras in December 1983, a new offensive was launched, named Plan Sierra. This offensive involved approximately 7000 members of the contra forces. As in earlier attacks, the initial objective of this offensive was to capture the border town of Jalapa to install a provisional government, which the CIA informed the contras would be immediately recognized by the United States Government. But this contra offensive was also repulsed by the Nicaraguan government forces.\n\nIn the beginning of 1984, the contras made a major effort to prevent the harvesting of the coffee crop, which is one of Nicaragua's most important export products. Coffee plantations and state farms where coffee is grown were attacked, vehicles were destroyed, and coffee farmers were killed.\n\nCommander Carrion testified that the ability of the contras to carry out military operations was completely dependent upon United States funding, training and logistical support. Carrion stated that the U.S. Government supplied the contras with uniforms, weapons, communications equipment, intelligence, training, and coordination in using this material aid.\n\nIn September 1983, CIA operatives blew up Nicaragua's only oil pipeline, which was used to transport oil from off-loading facilities to storage tanks on shore. The United States was also directly involved in a large scale sabotage operation directed against Nicaragua's oil storage facilities. This last attack was carried out by CIA contract employees termed by that organization as \"Unilaterally Controlled Latin Assets\" (UCLAs). The CIA personnel were also directly involved in a helicopter attack on a Nicaraguan army training camp. One of the helicopters was shot down by Nicaraguan ground fire resulting in the death of two U.S. citizens.\n\nCommander Carrion testified that the United States was involved in the mining of Nicaragua's ports between February - April 1984. The mining operation was carried out by CIA ships directing the operation from international waters, while the actual mining was carried out by CIA employees on board speedboats operating inshore. After the mine-laying was completed the speedboats returned to the mother vessel.[20][21]\n\nCarrion stated that 3,886 people had been killed and 4,731 wounded in the four years since the contras began their attacks. Carrion estimated property damage at $375 million.[22]\n\nCommander Carrion stated if the United States stopped aid, support and training, this would result in the end of the contras military activities within three months. Asked why he was so sure of this, Commander Carrion answered, \"Well, because the contras are an artificial force, artificially set up by the United States, that exists only because it counts on United States direction, on United States training, on United States assistance, on United States weapons, on United States everything...Without that kind of support and direction the contras would simply disband, disorganize, and thus lose their military capacity in a very short time\".[20]\n\nDavid MacMichael was an expert on counter-insurgency, guerrilla warfare, and Latin American affairs, he was also a witness because he was closely involved with U.S. intelligence activities as a contract employee from March 1981 - April 1983. MacMichael worked for Stanford Research Institute, which was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense. After this he worked two years for the CIA as a \"senior estimates officer\", preparing the National Intelligence Estimate. Dr. MacMichael's responsibility was centered upon Central America. He had top-secret clearance. He was qualified and authorized to have access to all relevant U.S. intelligence concerning Central America, including intelligence relating to alleged Nicaraguan support for, and arms shipments to the anti-Government insurgents in El Salvador. He took part in high level meetings of the Latin American affairs office of the CIA. Including a fall 1981 meeting, which submitted the initial plan to set up a 1500-man covert force on the Nicaraguan border, shipping arms from Nicaragua to the El Salvador insurgents. This plan was approved by President Reagan.[22][23]\n\n\"The overall purpose (for the creation of the contras) was to weaken, even destabilize the Nicaraguan Government and thus reduce the menace it allegedly posed to the United States' interests in Central America...\"\n\nContra paramilitary actions would \"hopefully provoke cross-border attacks by Nicaraguan forces and thus serve to demonstrate Nicaragua's aggressive nature and possibly call into play the Organization of American States' provisions (regarding collective self-defense). It was hoped that the Nicaraguan Government would clamp down on civil liberties within Nicaragua itself, arresting its opposition, so demonstrating its allegedly inherent totalitarian nature and thus increase domestic dissent within the country, and further that there would be reaction against United States citizens, particularly against United States diplomatic personnel within Nicaragua and thus to demonstrate the hostility of Nicaragua towards the United States\".\n\nMr. Glennon testified about a fact-finding mission he had conducted in Nicaragua to investigate alleged human rights violations committed by the contra guerrillas, sponsored by the International Human Rights Law Group, and the Washington Office on Latin America. Glennon conducted the investigation with Mr. Donald T. Fox who is a New York attorney and a member of the International Commission of Jurists.\n\nThey traveled to Nicaragua, visiting the northern region where the majority of contra military operations took place. The two lawyers interviewed around 36 northern frontier residents who had direct experience with the contras. They also spoke with the U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua, and with senior officials of the U.S. Department of State in Washington after returning to the United States.\n\nNo hearsay evidence was accepted. Professor Glennon stated that those interviewed were closely questioned and their evidence was carefully cross-checked with available documentary evidence. Doubtful \"testimonies\" were rejected, and the results were published in April 1985. The conclusions of the report were summarized by Glennon in Court:\n\nIn talks with U.S. State Department officials, at those in Managua U.S. Embassy, and with officials in Washington, Professor Glennon had inquired whether the U.S. Government had ever investigated human rights abuses by the contras. Professor Glennon testified that no such investigation had ever been conducted, because in the words of a ranking State Department official who he could not name, the U.S. Government maintained a policy of \"intentional ignorance\" on the matter. State Department officials in Washington- had admitted to Glennon that \"it was clear that the level of atrocities was enormous\". Those words \"enormous\" and \"atrocities\" were the ranking State Department official's words.[24]\n\nFather Jean Loison was a French priest who worked as a nurse in a hospital in the northern frontier region close to Honduras.\n\nAsked whether the contras engaged in acts of violence directed against the civilian population, Father Loison answered:\n\nFather Loison described many examples of violence, mostly indiscriminate, directed at the civilian population in the region where he resides. The picture that emerges from his testimony is that the contras engage in brutal violation of minimum standards of humanity. He described murders of unarmed civilians, including women and children, rape followed in many instances by torture or murder, and indiscriminate terror designed to coerce the civilian population. His testimony was similar to various reports including the International Human Rights Law Group, Amnesty International, and others.[25]\n\nWilliam H\u00fcper was Nicaragua's Minister of Finance. He testified about Nicaragua economic damage, including the loss of fuel as a result of the attack in the oil storage facilities at Corinto, the damage to Nicaragua's commerce as a result of the mining of its ports, and other economic damage.[26]\n\nAfter five vetoes in the Security Council between 1982 and 1985 of resolutions concerning the situation in Nicaragua [3], the United States made one final veto on 28 October 1986[27] (France, Thailand, and United Kingdom abstaining) of a resolution calling for full and immediate compliance with the judgment.[28]\n\nNicaragua brought the matter to the U.N. Security Council, where the United States vetoed a resolution (11 to 1, 3 abstentions) calling on all states to observe international law. Nicaragua also turned to the General Assembly, which passed a resolution 94 to 3 calling for compliance with the World Court ruling. Two states, Israel and El Salvador, joined the United States in opposition. At that time, El Salvador was receiving substantial funding and military advisement from the U.S., which was aiming to crush a Sandinista-like revolutionary movement by the FMLN. At the same session, Nicaragua called upon the U.N. to send an independent fact-finding mission to the border to secure international monitoring of the borders after a conflict there; the proposal was rejected by Honduras with U.S. backing. A year later, on November 12, 1987, the General Assembly again called for \"full and immediate compliance\" with the World Court decision. This time only Israel joined the United States in opposing adherence to the ruling.[29][30]\n\nThe United States refused to participate in the merits phase of the proceedings, but the Court found that the US refusal did not prevent it from deciding the case. The Court also rejected the United States defense that its action constituted collective self-defense. The United States argued that the Court did not have jurisdiction, with U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick dismissing the Court as a \"semi-legal, semi-juridical, semi-political body, which nations sometimes accept and sometimes don't.\" [31]\n\nThe United States had signed the treaty accepting the Court's decision as binding, but with the exception that the court would not have the power to hear cases based on multilateral treaty obligations unless it involved all parties to the treaty affected by that decision or the United States specially agreed to jurisdiction. The court found that it was obliged to apply this exception and refused to take on claims by Nicaragua based on the United Nations Charter and Organization of American States charter, but concluded that it could still decide the case based on customary international law obligations with 11-4 majority.\n\nAfter five vetoes in the Security Council between 1982 and 1985 of resolutions concerning the situation in Nicaragua [4], the United States made one final veto on 28 October 1986[27] (France, Thailand, and United Kingdom abstaining) of a resolution calling for full and immediate compliance with the Judgement.[28]\n\nWhen the same resolution was brought before the United Nations General Assembly on 3 November it was passed.[29] Only El Salvador and Israel voted with the U.S. against it. El Salvador's ruling junta was at that time receiving substantial funding and military advisement from the U.S., which was aiming to crush a Sandinista-like revolutionary movement by the FMLN. In spite of this resolution, the U.S. still chose not to pay the fine.\n\nProfessor of International Law, Anthony D'Amato, writing for the American Journal of International Law (Vol. 80, 1986), commented on this case, stating that \"...law would collapse if defendants could only be sued when they agreed to be sued, and the proper measurement of that collapse would be not just the drastically diminished number of cases but also the necessary restructuring of a vast system of legal transactions and relations predicated on the availability of courts as a last resort. There would be talk of a return to the law of the jungle.\" The author also notes that the case resulted in an unusual candor. A month after the announced withdrawal, Secretary of State Shultz suggested, and President Reagan later confirmed in a press conference, that the goal of U.S. policy was to overthrow the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua.[32] Although this was what Nicaragua had alleged to be the U.S. goal, while the case was actively pending, the United States could not concede that goal without serious risk of undermining its litigating position.[33]"}, "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/justice-minister-israel-s-jewish-majority-trumps-than-human-rights-1.5811106": {"title": "Justice minister: Israel must keep Jewish majority even at the expense of human rights", "keywords": ["Asylum seekers", "  Jewish nation-state", "  Israel High Court", "Israel news", " News from Israel", " Israeli business", " Israeli politics"], "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/justice-minister-israel-s-jewish-majority-trumps-than-human-rights-1.5811106", "text": "Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said Monday that if not for the fence erected some years ago on the Egyptian border, \u201cWe would be seeing here a kind of creeping conquest from Africa.\u201d The fence effectively stopped asylum-seekers from Sudan and Eritrea from entering the country.\n\nIn a speech to the Congress on Judaism and Democracy, Shaked also said, \u201cI think that \u2018Judaizing the Galilee\u2019 is not an offensive term. We used to talk like that. In recent years we\u2019ve stopped talking like that. I think it\u2019s legitimate without violating the full rights of the Arab residents of Israel.\u201d\n\nThe justice minister made the remarks in a wide-ranging speech on the controversy over the Jewish nation-state bill.\n\nShe further said, \u201cThere is place to maintain a Jewish majority even at the price of violation of rights.\u201d She added, however, that maintaining a Jewish majority in Israel and acting democratically \u201cmust be parallel and one must not outweigh the other.\u201d\n\nRegarding the nation-state bill, Shaked said, \u201cI was disturbed at both the position of the state and the reasoning of the justices. The state did not defend the law for national demographic reasons, it claimed only security reasons.\u201d Shaked told the conference that \u201cthe state should say that there is place to maintain the Jewish majority even if it violates rights.\u201d\n\nShaked said she believed Judaism and democracy are values that can coexist. \u201cFrom a constitutional point of view there is an advantage to democracy and it must be balanced and the Supreme Court should be given another constitutional tool that will also give power to Judaism.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the nation-state bill, she said, was to prevent rulings interpreting the Entry to Israel Law, or a ruling like the one in the Ka\u2019adan case in 2000 that banned discrimination against an Arab family who wanted to move to a small Jewish community that sought to bar them.\n\n\u201cIn our laws there are universal values, rights, already enshrined in a very serious way. But the national and the Jewish values are not enshrined. Over the past 20 years, there has been more of a focus on rulings over universal values and less over the Jewish character of the state. This tool [the nation state bill] is a tool that we want to give the court for the future,\u201d said the justice minister.\n\nIn response to a question from the interviewer, TV journalist Dana Weiss, on whether the court could not consider the Jewish character of the state without a nation-state law, she said: \u201cIt can, but it\u2019s as if you\u2019d say that without the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty the court won\u2019t care about dignity and human rights. It\u2019s different when you have a constitutional tool.\u201d\n\nShaked: Court could take 'equality' very far\n\nOn the coalition\u2019s intent to keep the word \u201cequality\u201d out of the nation-state bill, Shaked said: \u201cIsrael is a Jewish state. It isn\u2019t a state of all its nations. That is, equal rights to all citizens but not equal national rights.\u201d Shaked said the word \u201cequality\u201d was very general and the court could take it \u201cvery far,\u201d adding, \u201cThere are places where the character of the State of Israel as a Jewish state must be maintained and this sometimes comes at the expense of equality.\u201d\n\nShaked said the nation-state bill did not deal with the issue of who is a Jew. \u201cEveryone has his own Judaism. In the nation-state bill, when it talks about a Jew, it means the nationality.\u201d Shaked then referred to the Ka\u2019adan ruling and said that if such a case were to come up again or \u201cthe argument over whether it\u2019s all right for a Jewish community to, by definition, be only Jewish, I want the answer to be \u2018yes, it\u2019s all right.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe question of the legality of the Family Unification Law, which prevents the unification of families where one of the couple is Palestinian and one is Arab Israeli, was twice decided at the time by the Supreme Court by one vote, with six justices supporting it and five dissenting. The justices gave precedence to security considerations over the importance of the right to maintain a family, in a case that split the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Shaked\u2019s speeches, she often quotes the words of the late Justice Mishael Chesin, who was in the majority opinion that approved the law, in which he said Israel needed to awaken from the dream that it was a utopian state."}, "http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/index.html": {"title": "Full-text search", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/index.html", "text": ""}, "https://np.reddit.com/r/PussyPass/comments/65m0l3/that_moment_when_reality_hits_a_leftist_hard/": {"title": "That moment when reality hits a leftist.

The CWP, which advocated that Klan members should be \"physically beaten and chased out of town\", engaged in a shootout with members of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party.[1] Four members of the Communist Workers' Party, and one other individual were killed and eleven other demonstrators and a Klansman were wounded. The CWP supported workers' rights activism among mostly black textile industrial workers in the area.[2][3]\n\nTwo criminal trials of several Klan and ANP members were conducted: six men were prosecuted in a state criminal trial in 1980, five were charged with murder. All were acquitted. A second, federal criminal civil rights trial in 1984 concluded with the acquittal of the nine defendants. In the first trial, the jury concluded that the defendants acted in self-defense. In the second trial, the jury concluded that the defendant's actions were based on political, rather than racial, motivations.\n\nSurvivors filed a civil suit in 1980, led by the Christic Institute[citation needed]. The case in federal district court accused numerous police officers and four federal agents, as well as Klansmen and ANP members, of violating the civil rights of those killed, and it also charged the city with failure to protect the legal demonstration. The jury found the Klan/Nazi shooters liable for the death of Dr. Michael Nathan, the only non-CWP victim.[4] The jury also held the Greensboro Police Department responsible for failing to do more to prevent the shootings, because it was told by an informant that the KKK planned violence. These groups were ordered to pay a total of $350,000 in damages. This is one of the few times in US history when \"a jury held local police liable for cooperating with the Ku Klux Klan in a wrongful death.\"[5]\n\nIn November 2004, marking the 25th anniversary of the killings, about 700 people marched through Greensboro to city hall, on the original route.[6] That year, private citizens organized a Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission, modeled after commissions in South Africa and elsewhere. The intention was to investigate and hear testimony concerning the events of 1979. The organization failed to secure authority or local sanction when the mayor and most of the City Council voted against endorsing the undertaking. It lacked both subpoena power to compel testimony, and the ability to invoke the punishment of perjury for false testimony. The commission issued a Final Report concluding that, while both sides had contributed to the massacre by engaging in inflammatory rhetoric, the Klan and ANP members intended to inflict injury on protesters, and the police department had colluded with the Klan by allowing anticipated violence to take place. In 2009 the Greensboro City Council passed a resolution expressing regret for the deaths. In 2015 the city unveiled a historical marker to acknowledge the Greensboro Massacre. Three hundred people attended the ceremony. On August 15, 2017, the Greensboro City Council apologized for the massacre.[7]\n\nThe Communist Workers' Party (CWP), which followed the policies of Mao Zedong, had its origin in 1973 in New York as a splinter group of the Communist Party USA. \"The CWP was one of several groups established as part of a Maoist revival within the radical community. To the Maoists, the pro-Soviet Communist Party USA was deemed to be soft on capitalism and lacking in militancy.\"[4] Its leaders intended to increase activism in what they called the Workers Viewpoint Organization (WVO), along the Maoist model. In 1979, members of the CWP came to North Carolina in an attempt to organize textile workers. In the South, the communists had achieved little success with white workers, so they shifted much of their attention to black textile workers. These efforts brought the CWP into conflict with a local Ku Klux Klan chapter, and the American Nazi Party. Some CWP members worked personally in the textile mills, including Dr. James Waller, who left his medical practice to do so. He became president of the local textile workers union. WVO members were active in Durham and Greensboro.\n\nThe WVO pushed back against racial discrimination in North Carolina by confronting a local Ku Klux Klan chapter. Hostility between the groups flared in July 1979, when protesters in China Grove, North Carolina, disrupted a screening of The Birth of a Nation, a 1915 silent film by D. W. Griffith which portrayed the era of Reconstruction and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan in heroic terms, and portrayed blacks in a demeaning, racist way. Taunts and inflammatory rhetoric were exchanged between members of the groups during the ensuing months.\n\nIn October 1979 the WVO renamed itself the Communist Workers Organization. It planned to stage a rally and a march against the Klan on November 3, 1979, in Greensboro. This was the county seat of Guilford County and it had been a site of major civil rights actions in the 1960s, starting with sit-ins that resulted in the desegregation of lunch counters. Called the \"Death to the Klan March\" by the CWP, the event was scheduled to start in a predominantly black housing project called Morningside Homes on the black side of town and from there it would proceed to the Greensboro City Hall.[8] The Communist Workers' Party distributed flyers that \"called for radical, even violent opposition to the Klan\".[2] One flier said that the Klan \u201cshould be physically beaten and chased out of town. This is the only language they understand. Armed self-defense is the only defense.\"[2] Communist organizers publicly challenged the Klan to present themselves and \"face the wrath of the people\".[9]\n\nFour local TV news camera teams arrived at the Morningside Homes at the corner of Carver and Everitt streets to cover the protest march. Members of the CWP and other anti-Klan supporters gathered to rally the march, which was planned to proceed through the city to the Greensboro City Hall.\n\nAs the marchers collected, a caravan of ten cars (and a van) filled with an estimated 40 KKK and American Nazi Party members drove back and forth in front of the housing project. Several marchers beat the cars with picket sticks or threw rocks at them. In response, the KKK and ANP members got out of their cars, took shotguns, rifles and pistols from the trunks, and fired into the crowd of protesters. Some of the latter were armed with handguns, which they fired during the brief conflict.[2] It is not entirely clear who fired the first shot.[2] Witnesses reported that KKK member Mark Sherer fired first, into the air.[10] According to white supremacist Frazier Glenn Miller, the first shots were fired from a handgun by an anti-Klan demonstrator.[11]\n\nThe KKK and American Nazi Party members quickly killed Cesar Cauce, Dr. James Waller, and Bill Sampson at the scene. Sandi Smith was shot between the eyes when she looked out from a place where she had taken shelter, and eleven others were wounded. Dr. Michael Nathan died of his wounds at the hospital.[12] The filmed coverage of the shootings was carried on national and international news. It became known as the \"Greensboro Massacre.\" Smith was black, Cauce was Hispanic, and the other three men who were killed were white. Both blacks and whites were wounded.\n\nDied: All but Dr. Michael Nathan were CWP members and rank-and-file union leaders and organizers.[13]\n\nBy the late 1970s, most police departments had become familiar with handling demonstrations, especially in cities such as Greensboro where numerous civil rights events had taken place since 1960. CWP march organizers had filed their plans for this march with the police and gained permission to hold it. Police generally covered such formal events in order to prevent outbreaks of violence; few officers were present during this march. A police photographer and a detective followed the Klan and neo-Nazi caravan to the site, but they did not attempt to intervene in events.\n\nEdward Dawson, a Klansman-turned police informant,[3] was riding in the lead car of the caravan.[12] He had been an FBI informant beginning in 1969 as part of the agency's COINTELPRO program and was among the founders of the North Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan when the North Carolina chapter of the United Klans of America split.[16] By 1979 he was working as an informant for the Greensboro Police Department. He was given a copy of the march route by the police and informed them of the potential for violence.[9] Because the police were absent, the attackers escaped with relative ease.\n\nBernard Butkovich, an undercover agent for the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), had infiltrated a unit of the American Nazi Party (ANP) during this period. This group had been formed by Frank Collin, who had been ousted from the National Socialist White People's Party. The ANP members joined with the KKK chapter to disrupt the November 1979 protest march. At the 1980 criminal trial, the neo-Nazis claimed that Butkovich encouraged them to carry firearms to the demonstration. At the 1985 civil trial, Butkovich testified that he was aware that the Klansmen and the ANP members intended to confront the demonstrators; he did not tell the police or any other law enforcement agency.[17]\n\nA funeral was held on November 11, 1979, followed by a procession in which 200-400 people marched through the city to Maplewood Cemetery. There was controversy over whether or not the funeral should be held, but the city had arranged for full coverage by the police force and hundreds of armed National Guard troops.[18]\n\nThe four white men were buried in the traditionally all-black cemetery near Morningside. The inscription intended for their memorial was initially opposed by the city council, citing new ordinances banning political speech in that context. With support from the North Carolina ACLU they were able to move forward one year later, commemorating the fallen with the following message:\n\nThe body of Sandi Smith, the only black victim, was returned to her hometown in South Carolina at her family's request.\n\nThe Greensboro Justice Fund was founded by families of the victims and their supporters shortly after November 3, 1979, in order to support litigation and public education related to the events and civil rights violations. Members of the Board of Directors were: Phillip Berrigan, anti-war activist; Rev. Ben Chavis, United Church of Christ, member of the Wilmington 10; Michio Kaku, PhD., nuclear physicist and anti-nuke activist; Elizabeth McAlister, anti-war activist; Martha Nathan, MD, widow of Dr. Michael Nathan, among the five dead; Neil Prose, MD, occupational health and safety activist; and Phil Thompson, CWP. Dr. Prose was the Justice Fund's first national executive director, and Dr. \"Marty\" Nathan succeeded him.[20]\n\nThe Justice Fund retained civil rights lawyers to bring suit on behalf of the victims. They filed a Federal Civil Rights Act Complaint in Federal District Court in Greensboro in November 1980. The legal team at the time was made up of:[20]\n\nForty Klansmen and neo-Nazis, and several CWP marchers were said to have taken part in the shootings. The police arrested 16 Klansmen and Nazis, and several CWP members. The FBI started an investigation which it called GREENKIL (Greensboro Killings), turning over evidence it gathered to the state of North Carolina for its murder trial.[21] The state attorney prosecuted the six strongest criminal cases first, charging five Klansmen with murder: David Wayne Matthews, Jerry Paul Smith, Jack Wilson Fowler, Harold Dean Flowers, and Billy Joe Franklin. One was charged with a lesser crime.[3][22] In November 1980 the all-white jury acquitted all the defendants, based on their pleas of self-defense.[23] Residents of Morningside Homes \u2014 the housing development where the violence occurred, and students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (A&T), expressed shock and anger over the verdict and a feeling of hopelessness regarding the judicial system and the Ku Klux Klan.[24]\n\nThe Department of Justice through the FBI had an extensive criminal investigation underway.[21] After the acquittals in 1980, the FBI re-opened its investigation in preparation for a federal prosecution. Based on additional evidence, a federal grand jury indicted nine men on civil rights charges in 1983 .[21]\n\nDuring this second criminal trial, the US attorney prosecuted nine men.[25] Under civil rights laws, \"It charged the Klansmen and Nazis with racially motivated violence and with interference in a racially integrated event.\"[23] Three men were charged with violating the civil rights of the five victims: the defendants were David Wayne Matthews, Jerry Paul Smith and Jack Wilson Fowler, who had been prosecuted and acquitted in the state criminal trial.\n\nSix other men were charged with \"conspiracy to violate the demonstrators' civil rights:\"[23] Virgil Lee Griffin, Sr.; Eddie Dawson (also a police informant), Roland Wayne Wood, Roy Clinton Toney, Coleman Blair Pridmore,[26] and Rayford Milano Caudle[27] In April 1984, all the defendants were acquitted. The CWP believed that the indictment was drawn too narrowly, giving the defense an opportunity to argue that political opposition to Communism, rather than racial motivations, prompted the confrontation.[23] Neither trial \"investigated the actions of Federal agents or the Greensboro police.\"\n\nIn 1980, survivors filed a civil suit in Federal District Court seeking $48 million in damages.[8] The Christic Institute led the legal effort.[citation needed] The complaint alleged that law-enforcement officials knew \"that Klansmen and Nazis would use violence to disrupt the demonstration by Communist labor organizers and black residents of Greensboro but deliberately failed to protect them.\"[25] Four federal agents were named as defendants in the suit, in addition to 36 Greensboro police and municipal officials, and 20 Klansmen and members of the American Nazi Party.[25] Among the federal defendants was Bernard Butkovich of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who had worked as an undercover agent in 1979 and infiltrated one of the American Nazi Party chapters about three months before the protest. He testified that a Klansmen had referred in a planning meeting to using pipe bombs for possible assaults at the rally, and that he took no further action.[25]\n\nThe Christic legal team was led by attorneys Lewis Pitts and Daniel Sheehan, together with People's Law Office attorney G. Flint Taylor and attorney Carolyn MacAllister of Durham, North Carolina.[28] A Federal jury in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, found two Klansmen, three Nazis, two Greensboro police officers, and a police informant liable for the wrongful death of Dr. Michael Nathan, a non-CWP demonstrator, and for injuries to survivors Paul Bermanzohn and Tom Clark, who had been wounded.[25] It awarded two survivors with a $350,000 judgment against the city, the Ku Klux Klan, and the American Nazi Party for violating the civil rights of the demonstrators.[29] The widow Dr. Martha \"Marty\" Nathan, was paid by the City in order to cover damages caused by the KKK and ANP as well. She chose to donate some money to grassroots efforts for social justice and education.[28]\n\nThe CWP gradually dissolved, and its members went on to other pursuits. In November 2004, nearly 700 people, including several survivors, marched in Greensboro along the original planned route from the housing project to Greensboro City Hall to mark the 25th anniversary of the event.[6]\n\nThat year, a group of private citizens founded the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They appealed to the Mayor and the City Council for their endorsement, but failed to gain support. The Greensboro City Council, led by mayor Keith Holliday, voted 6 to 3 against endorsing the work of the group. The three African-American members of the Council voted in favor of the measure.[30] The mayor at the time of the massacre, Jim Melvin, also rejected the private commission.[30]\n\nThe private group announced that the Commission would take public testimony and conduct an investigation, in order to examine the causes and consequences of the massacre. It was patterned after official Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, generally organized by national governments, such as that notably conducted in post-apartheid South Africa. But, the Greensboro commission had no official recognition and authority. It lacked both the power of subpoena to compel testimony, and the ability to invoke the penalty of perjury for false testimony.[31][32]\n\nThe Commission reported its findings and conclusions. It noted that both the Communist Workers Party and the Klan contributed in varying degrees to the violence, especially given the violent rhetoric which they had been espousing for months leading up to the confrontation at the march. It said that the protesters, most of whom did not live in Greensboro or the county, had not fully secured the community support of the Morningside Homes residents for holding the event there. Many of the residents did not approve of the protest because they feared it had the risk of catalyzing violence on their doorsteps. The Commission concluded that the KKK and ANP members went to the rally intending to provoke a violent confrontation, and that they fired on demonstrators with intent of injury.[33]\n\nIn its Final Report, the Commission noted the importance of the Greensboro Police Department's absence from the scene. The presence of police at previous confrontations between the same groups had resulted in no violence. There had been testimony at the Commission that the Greensboro Police Department had infiltrated the Klan and, through a paid informant, knew of the white supremacists\u2019 plans and the strong potential for violence that day.[34] The informant had formerly been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's payroll and maintained contact with his agent's supervisor. Consequently, the FBI was also aware of the impending armed confrontation.[35] The Commission reported that at least one activist in the crowd fired back after the attack started.[36]"}, "http://www.bradfordera.com/news/sheriff-s-deputy-suspended-for-taking-down-nazi-flag-on/article_0d4f57f4-07bb-11e8-9979-e70a3ea96d05.html": {"title": "Sheriff\u2019s deputy suspended for taking down Nazi flag on private property", "keywords": ["deputy", " military", " police", " colin meeker", " daniel burnside", " work", " dan woods", " sheriff", " mckean county", " state police"], "url": "http://www.bradfordera.com/news/sheriff-s-deputy-suspended-for-taking-down-nazi-flag-on/article_0d4f57f4-07bb-11e8-9979-e70a3ea96d05.html", "text": "A McKean County sheriff\u2019s deputy has been suspended and is under investigation for allegedly entering the private property of a white supremacist group in Ulysses and removing a flag displaying Nazi symbols while on duty.\n\nThe alleged incident took place Jan. 21 in Potter County when Deputy Colin Meeker was in the vicinity of Ulysses serving court papers.

His office says the company trained new employees on the process to give the guest registry and all the names of their guests to ICE.\n\n\"At the South Everett location, for example, ICE agents visited the motels early in the morning or late at night, requested the day\u2019s guest list, circled any Latino-sounding names and returned to their vehicles,\" a news release on Ferguson's investigation said. \"On at least one occasion, ICE later returned to the motel and detained at least one individual.

For more than a year, Yiannopoulos led the site in a coy dance around the movement\u2019s nastier edges, writing stories that minimized the role of neo-Nazis and white nationalists while giving its politer voices \u201ca fair hearing.\u201d In March, Breitbart editor Alex Marlow insisted \u201cwe\u2019re not a hate site.\u201d Breitbart\u2019s media relations staff repeatedly threatened to sue outlets that described Yiannopoulos as racist. And after the violent white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, Breitbart published an article explaining that when Bannon said the site welcomed the alt-right, he was merely referring to \u201ccomputer gamers and blue-collar voters who hated the GOP brand.\u201d These new emails and documents, however, clearly show that Breitbart does more than tolerate the most hate-filled, racist voices of the alt-right. It thrives on them, fueling and being fueled by some of the most toxic beliefs on the political spectrum \u2014 and clearing the way for them to enter the American mainstream. It\u2019s a relationship illustrated most starkly by a previously unreleased April 2016 video in which Yiannopoulos sings \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d in a Dallas karaoke bar as admirers, including the white nationalist Richard Spencer, raise their arms in Nazi salutes. These documents chart the Breitbart alt-right universe. They reveal how the website \u2014 and, in particular, Yiannopoulos \u2014 links the Mercer family, the billionaires who fund Breitbart, to underpaid trolls who fill it with provocative content, and to extremists striving to create a white ethnostate. They capture what Bannon calls his \u201ckilling machine\u201d in action, as it dredges up the resentments of people around the world, sifts through these grievances for ideas and content, and propels them from the unsavory parts of the internet up to TrumpWorld, collecting advertisers\u2019 checks all along the way. And the cache of emails \u2014 some of the most newsworthy of which BuzzFeed News is now making public \u2014 expose the extent to which this machine depended on Yiannopoulos, who channeled voices both inside and outside the establishment into a clear narrative about the threat liberal discourse posed to America. The emails tell the story of Steve Bannon\u2019s grand plan for Yiannopoulos, whom the Breitbart executive chairman transformed from a charismatic young editor into a conservative media star capable of magnetizing a new generation of reactionary anger. Often, the documents reveal, this anger came from a legion of secret sympathizers in Silicon Valley, Hollywood, academia, suburbia, and everywhere in between. \"I have said in the past that I find humor in breaking taboos and laughing at things that people tell me are forbidden to joke about,\" Yiannopoulos wrote in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \"But everyone who knows me also knows I'm not a racist. As someone of Jewish ancestry, I of course condemn racism in the strongest possible terms. I have stopped making jokes on these matters because I do not want any confusion on this subject. I disavow Richard Spencer and his entire sorry band of idiots. I have been and am a steadfast supporter of Jews and Israel. I disavow white nationalism and I disavow racism and I always have.\u201d He added that during his karaoke performance, his \"severe myopia\" made it impossible for him to see the Hitler salutes a few feet away.\n\n Steve Bannon, the other Breitbart employees named in the story, and the Mercer family did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Like all the new media success stories, Breitbart\u2019s alt-right platform depends on the participation of its audience. It combusts the often secret fury of those who reject liberal norms into news, and it doesn\u2019t burn clean.\n\n Now Bannon is back at the controls of the machine, which he has said he is \u201crevving up.\u201d The Mercers have funded Yiannopoulos's post-Breitbart venture. And these documents present the clearest look at what these people may have in store for America.\n\nA year and a half ago, Milo Yiannopoulos set himself a difficult task: to define the alt-right. It was five months before Hillary Clinton named the alt-right in a campaign speech, 10 months before the alt-right\u2019s great hope became president, and 17 months before Charlottesville clinched the alt-right as a stalking horse for violent white nationalism. The movement had just begun its explosive emergence into the country\u2019s politics and culture.\n\n At the time, Yiannopoulos, who would later describe himself as a \u201cfellow traveler\u201d of the alt-right, was the tech editor of Breitbart. In summer 2015, after spending a year gathering momentum through GamerGate \u2014 the opening salvo of the new culture wars \u2014 he convinced Breitbart upper management to give him his own section. And for four months, he helped Bannon wage what the Breitbart boss called in emails to staff \u201c#war.\u201d It was a war, fought story by story, against the perceived forces of liberal activism on every conceivable battleground in American life. Yiannopoulos was a useful soldier whose very public identity as a gay man (one who has now married a black man) helped defend him, his anti-political correctness crusade, and his employer from charges of bigotry. But now Yiannopoulos had a more complicated fight on his hands. The left \u2014 and worse, some on the right \u2014 had started to condemn the new conservative energy as reactionary and racist. Yiannopoulos had to take back \u201calt-right,\u201d to redefine for Breitbart\u2019s audience a poorly understood, leaderless movement, parts of which had already started to resist the term itself. So he reached out to key constituents, who included a neo-Nazi and a white nationalist. \u201cFinally doing my big feature on the alt right,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote in a March 9, 2016, email to Andrew \u201cWeev\u201d Auernheimer, a hacker who is the system administrator of the neo-Nazi hub the Daily Stormer, and who would later ask his followers to disrupt the funeral of Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer. \u201cFancy braindumping some thoughts for me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to do my big definitive guide to the alt right,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote four hours later to Curtis Yarvin, a software engineer who under the nom de plume Mencius Moldbug helped create the \u201cneoreactionary\u201d movement, which holds that Enlightenment democracy has failed and that a return to feudalism and authoritarian rule is in order. \u201cWhich is my whorish way of asking if you have anything you\u2019d like to make sure I include.\u201d \u201cAlt r feature, figured you\u2019d have some thoughts,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote the same day to Devin Saucier, who helps edit the online white nationalist magazine American Renaissance under the pseudonym Henry Wolff, and who wrote a story in June 2017 called \u201cWhy I Am (Among Other Things) a White Nationalist.\u201d The three responded at length: Weev about the Daily Stormer and a podcast called The Daily Shoah, Yarvin in characteristically sweeping world-historical assertions (\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that North America contains many distinct cultural/ethnic communities. This is not optimal, but with a competent king it\u2019s not a huge problem either\u201d), and Saucier with a list of thinkers, politicians, journalists, films (Dune, Mad Max, The Dark Knight), and musical genres (folk metal, martial industrial, \u201980s synthpop) important to the movement. Yiannopoulos forwarded it all, along with the Wikipedia entries for \u201cAlternative Right\u201d and the esoteric far-right Italian philosopher Julius Evola \u2014 a major influence on 20th-century Italian fascists and Richard Spencer alike \u2014 to Allum Bokhari, his deputy and frequent ghostwriter, whom he had met during GamerGate. \u201cInclude a bit of everything,\u201d he instructed Bokhari.\n\nAlso, there was another sensitive issue to be raised: credit. \u201cAllum did most of the work on this and wants joint [byline] but I want the glory here,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote back to Marlow. \u201cI am telling him you said it\u2019s sensitive and want my byline alone on it.\u201d Minutes later, Yiannopoulos emailed Bokhari. \u201cI was going to have Marlow collude with me \u2026 about the byline on the alt right thing because I want to take it solo. Will you hate me too much if I do that? \u2026 Truthfully management is very edgy on this one (They love it but it\u2019s racially charged) and they would prefer it.\u201d \u201cWill management definitely say no if it\u2019s both of us?\u201d Bokhari responded. \u201cI think it actually lowers the risk if someone with a brown-sounding name shares the BL.\u201d Five days later, March 22nd, Marlow returned with comments. He suggested that the story should show in more detail how Yiannopoulos and most of the alt-right rejected the actual neo-Nazis in the movement. And he added that Taki's Magazine and VDare, two publications Yiannopoulos and Bokhari identified as part of the alt-right, \u201care both racist. \u2026 We should disclaimer that or strike that part of the history from the article.\u201d (The published story added, in the passive voice, \u201cAll of these websites have been accused of racism.\u201d) Again the story went back to Bokhari, who on the 24th sent Yiannopoulos still another draft, with the subject head \u201cALT RIGHT, MEIN FUHRER.\u201d On the 27th, now co-bylined, the story was ready for upper management: Bannon and Larry Solov, Breitbart\u2019s press-shy CEO. It was also ready, on a separate email chain, for another read and round of comments from the white nationalist Saucier, the feudalist Yarvin, the neo-Nazi Weev, and Vox Day. \u201cI need to go thru this tomorrow in depth\u2026although I do appreciate any piece that mentions evola,\u201d Bannon wrote. On the 29th, in an email titled \u201csteve wants you to read this,\u201d Marlow sent Yiannopoulos a list of edits and notes Bannon had solicited from James Pinkerton, a former Reagan and George H.W. Bush staffer and a contributing editor of the American Conservative. The 59-year-old Pinkerton was put off by a cartoon of Pepe the Frog conducting the Trump Train. \u201cI love art,\u201d he wrote inline. \u201cI think [Breitbart News Network] needs a lot more of it, but I don\u2019t get the above. Frogs? Kermit? Am I missing something here?\u201d Later that day, Breitbart published \u201cAn Establishment Conservative\u2019s Guide to the Alt-Right.\u201d It quickly became a touchstone, cited in the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the New Yorker, CNN, and New York Magazine, among others. And its influence is still being felt. This past July, in a speech in Warsaw that was celebrated by the alt-right, President Trump echoed a line from the story \u2014 a story written by a \u201cbrown-sounding\u201d amanuensis, all but line-edited by a white nationalist, laundered for racism by Breitbart\u2019s editors, and supervised by the man who would in short order become the president\u2019s chief strategist. The machine had worked well.\n\nOn December 8, the New York Times published a major story about the radicalization of American Muslims on Facebook. Yiannopoulos published a story called \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.\u201d \u201cDude---we r in a global existentialist war where our enemy EXISTS in social media and u r jerking yourself off w/ marginalia!!!! U should be OWNING this conversation because u r everything they hate!!! Drop your toys, pick up your tools and go help save western civilization.\u201d \u201cMessage received,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote back. \u201cI will do a Week of Islam next week.\u201d \u201cU don\u2019t need that,\u201d Bannon responded. \u201cJust get in the fight---ur Social Media and they have made it a powerful weapon of war. \u2026 There is no war correspondent in the west yet dude and u can own it and be remember for 3 generations--or sit around wasting your God-given talents jerking off to your fan base.\u201d Over the next several months, Yiannopoulos began to find the right targets. First it was a continued attack on Shaun King, the writer and Black Lives Matter activist whose ethnicity Yiannopoulos had called into question. Next it was then\u2013Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who Bannon called in an email to Yiannopoulos the \u201cposter child for the narcissistic ecosystem.\u201d And increasingly it was enemies of Donald Trump. In response to a Yiannopoulos pitch accusing a prominent Republican opponent of Trump of being a pill-popper, Bannon wrote: \u201cDude!!! LMAO! \u2026 Epic.\u201d And Bannon signed off on an April story by Yiannopoulos imploring #NeverTrumpers to get on board with \u201cTrump and the alt-right.\u201d (Bannon did, however, veto making it the lead story on the site, writing to Yiannopoulos and Marlow, \u201cLooks like we have our thumb on the scale.\u201d) Why was Bannon so concerned with the focus of his tech editor\u2019s energies? In a February email exchange before Yiannopoulos appeared on Greg Gutfeld\u2019s Sunday Fox News show, Bannon wrote, \u201cGutfeld should become an object lesson for u. Brilliant cultural commentator who really got pop culture, the hipster scene and advant [sic] garde\u2026.got on fox and tried to become a political pundit...lost all credibility. \u2026 You r one of the potential heirs to his cultural leadership so act according.\u201d Bannon was grooming the younger man for something greater. In May, Bannon invited Yiannopoulos to Cannes for a week for the film festival. \u201cWant to discuss tv and film with u,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cU get to meet my partners, hang on the boat and discuss business.\u201d\n\nOn July 22, 2016, Rebekah Mercer \u2014 Robert\u2019s powerful daughter \u2014 emailed Steve Bannon from her Stanford alumni account. She wanted the Breitbart executive chairman, whom she introduced as \u201cone of the greatest living defenders of Liberty,\u201d to meet an app developer she knew. Apple had rejected the man\u2019s game (Capitol HillAwry, in which players delete emails \u00e0 la Hillary Clinton) from the App Store, and the younger Mercer wondered \u201cif we could put an article up detailing his 1st amendment political persecution.\u201d\n\n Bannon passed the request from Mercer to Yiannopoulos. Yiannopoulos passed it to Charlie Nash, an 18-year-old Englishman whom he had met at a conference of the populist right-wing UK Independence Party conference the previous year, and who started working as his intern immediately after. Like some bleach-blonde messiah of anti\u2013political correctness, Yiannopoulos tended to draw in ideologically sympathetic young men at conferences, campus speeches, and on social media, accumulating more and more acolytes as he went along. In June 2015 it was Ben Kew, who invited Yiannopoulos to speak at the University of Bristol, where he was a student; he\u2019s now a staff writer for Breitbart. In September 2015 it was Tom Ciccotta, the treasurer of the class of 2017 at Bucknell University, who still writes for Breitbart. In February 2016 it was Hunter Swogger, a University of Michigan student and then the editor of the conservative Michigan Review, whom Yiannopoulos cultivated and brought on as a social media specialist during his Dangerous Faggot tour. Yiannopoulos called these young researchers his \u201ctrufflehounds.\u201d Nash, who had just been hired by Breitbart at $30,000 a year after months of lobbying by Yiannopoulos, dutifully fielded the request from the billionaire indirectly paying his salary and turned around a story about the rejected Capitol HillAwry app on the 25th \u2014 and a follow-up five days later after Apple reversed its decision. This was the usual way stories came in from the Mercers, according to a former Breitbart editor: with a request from Bannon referring to \u201cour investors\u201d or \u201cour investing partners.\u201d After Cannes, as Bannon pushed Yiannopoulos to do more live events that presented expensive logistical challenges, the involvement of the investing partners became increasingly obvious. Following a May event at DePaul University in Chicago in which Black Lives Matter protesters stormed a Yiannopoulos speech, he wrote to Bannon, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t confess this to anyone publicly, of course, but I was worried ... last night that I was going to get punched or worse. ... I need one or two people of my own.\u201d\n\nBut Gionet, who would go on to march with the alt-right in Charlottesville, was still useful to Yiannopoulos as a gateway to a group of young, hip, social media\u2013savvy Trump supporters. Yiannopoulos managed all of his assistants and ghostwriters under his own umbrella, using \u201cyiannopoulos.net\u201d emails and private Slack rooms. This structure insulated Breitbart\u2019s upper management from the 4chan savants and GamerGate vets working for Yiannopoulos. And it gave Yiannopoulos a staff loyal to him above Breitbart. (Indeed, Yiannopoulos shopped a separate \u201cTeam Milo\u201d section to Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, in July 2016.) It also sometimes led to extraordinarily fraught organizational and personal dynamics. Take Allum Bokhari, the Oxford-educated former political consultant whom Yiannopoulos rewarded for his years of grunt work with a $100,000 ghostwriting contract for his book Dangerous. But the men were spying on each other. In April 2016, Yiannopoulos asked Bokhari for \u201ca complete list of the email, social media, bank accounts, and any other system and services of mine you have been accessing, and how long you\u2019ve had access.\u201d Bokhari confessed to having logged into Yiannopoulos\u2019s email and Slack, and had used Yiannopoulos\u2019s credit card for an Airbnb, a confession Yiannopoulos quickly passed on to Larry Solov, the Breitbart CEO. \u201cMy basic position is that he is not stable and needs to be far away from me,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote to Marlow and Solov. Meanwhile, Yiannopoulos had compiled a transcript of what he called \u201ca short section of 30 hours of recording down on paper,\u201d which appeared to be of conversations between Bokhari and a friend. The newcomers brought in by Gionet weren\u2019t much better behaved. Yiannopoulos had to boot one prospective member of his \u201ctour squad\u201d for posting cocaine use on Snapchat. Mike Mahoney, a then\u201320-year-old from North Carolina, had to be monitored because of his propensity for racism and anti-Semitism on social media. (Mahoney was later banned from Twitter, but he\u2019s relocated to Gab, a free speech uber alles social network where he is free to post messages such as \u201creminder: muslims are fags.\u201d) \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything specific that\u2019s really bad eg any Jew stuff,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote of Mahoney in an email to another member of his staff. \u201cHis entire Twitter persona will have to change dramatically once he gets the job.\u201d On September 11, 2016, Mahoney signed a $2,500-a-month contract with Glittering Steel. As the Dangerous Faggot tour swung into gear, Yiannopoulos grew increasingly hostile toward Fleuette, whom he excoriated for late payments to his young crew, lack of support, and disorganization. \u201cThe entire tour staff is demanding money,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote in one email to Fleuette in October. \u201cNo one knows or cares who Glittering Steel is but this represents a significantly damaging risk to my reputation if it gets out.\u201d And in another, \u201cYour problem right now is keeping me happy.\" Yet ultimately Fleuette was necessary \u2014 he connected Yiannopoulos\u2019s madcap world and the massively rich people funding the machine. \u201cI think you know who the final decision belongs to,\u201d Fleuette wrote to Yiannopoulos after one particularly frantic request for money. \u201cI am in daily communication with them.\u201d\n\nYiannopoulos\u2019s star rose throughout 2016 thanks to a succession of controversial public appearances, social media conflagrations, Breitbart radio spots, television hits, and magazine profiles. Bannon\u2019s guidance, the Mercers\u2019 patronage, and the creative energy of his young staff had come together at exactly the time Donald Trump turned offensive speech into a defining issue in American culture. And for thousands of people, Yiannopoulos, Breitbart\u2019s poster child for offensive speech, became a secret champion.\n\n Aggrieved by the encroachment of so-called cultural Marxism into American public life, and egged on by an endless stream of stories on Fox News about safe spaces and racially charged campus confrontations, a diverse group of Americans took to Yiannopoulos\u2019s inbox to thank him and to confess their fears about the future of the country. He heard from ancient veterans who \u201cbinge-watched\u201d his speeches on YouTube; from \u201ca 58 year old asian woman\u201d concerned about her high school daughter\u2019s progressive teachers; from boys asking how to win classroom arguments against feminists; from a former NASA employee who said he had been \u201claid off by my fat female boss\u201d and was sad that the Jet Propulsion Lab had become \u201ccompletely cucked\u201d; from a man who had bought his 11-year-old son an AR-15 and named it \u201cMilo\u201d; from an Indiana lesbian who said she \u201cdespised liberals\u201d and begged Yiannopoulos to \u201ckeep triggering the special snowflakes\u201d; from a doctoral student in philosophy who said he had been threatened with dismissal from his program for sharing his low opinion of Islam; from a Charlotte police officer thanking Yiannopoulos for his \u201ccommon sense Facebook posts\u201d about the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott (\u201cBLUE LIVES MATTER,\u201d Yiannopoulos responded); from a New Jersey school teacher who feared his students would become \u201cpawns for the left social justice campaign\u201d; from a man who said he had returned from a deployment in \u201can Islamic country\u201d to discover that his wife was transitioning and wanted a divorce (subject line \u201cRegressivism stole my wife\u201d); from a father terrified his daughter might attend Smith College; from fans who wanted to give him jokes to use about fat people, about gay people, about Muslims, about Hillary Clinton. He also heard, with frequency, from accomplished people in predominantly liberal industries \u2014 entertainment, tech, academia, fashion, and media \u2014 who resented what they felt was a censorious coastal cultural orthodoxy. Taken together, they represent something like a network of sleeper James Damores, vexed but silent for fear of losing their jobs or friends, kvetching to Yiannopoulos as a pressure valve. For Yiannopoulos, these emails weren\u2019t just validation, though they were obviously that. They sometimes became more ammunition for the culture war. \u201cI\u2019m a relatively recent ex-lefty who received deep liberal indoctrination via elite private schools (Yale and Andover),\u201d wrote one film editor who introduced herself as an \u201cUndercover \u2018pede in Hollywood.\" (\u201cCentipede\u201d is slang for an online Trump supporter.) \u201cI\u2019ve been deeply closeted thus far due to the severe personal and professional repercussions of not beating the progressive drum.\u201d In an email titled \u201cWorking for E! Is Hell,\u201d a production manager at the cable network wrote Yiannopoulos that her employer was a \u201ccontributor to the fake news machine and my colleagues have become insufferable. \u2026 I \u2026 offer you my services \u2026 a partner in fighting globalism.\u201d And Adam Grandmaison, whom Rolling Stone described as \u201cunderground hip-hop\u2019s major tastemaker,\u201d reached out to Yiannopoulos to suggest he investigate a journalist who had accused her ex-boyfriend of physical abuse. In an email to BuzzFeed News, Grandmaison wrote that he was merely voicing concern about a black man being judged by the media, and that \"I didn't intend for [Milo] to write about it.\" (Grandmaison's email to Yiannopoulos began \"first off i absolutely do not want credit for tipping you off to this.\") Even more tips came in from tech workers. A Google employee sent Yiannopoulos a picture of a cartoon gingerbread man named \u201cGogy, the Googely Googler\u201d that had been posted by a coffee machine to remind employees to tidy up. According to the Google employee, the sign had turned into an HR problem after employees were angered that Gogy was identified as male.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Devin Saucier has been establishing himself as one of the bright young things in American white nationalism. In 2008, while at Vanderbilt University, Saucier founded a chapter of the defunct white nationalist student group Youth for Western Civilization, which counts among its alumni the white nationalist leader Matthew Heimbach. Richard Spencer called him a friend. He is associated with the Wolves of Vinland, a Virginia neo-pagan group that one reporter described as a \u201cwhite power wolf cult,\u201d one member of which pleaded guilty to setting fire to a historic black church. For the past several years, according to an observer of far-right movements, Saucier has worked as an assistant to Jared Taylor, possibly the most prominent white nationalist in America. According to emails obtained by BuzzFeed News, he edits and writes for Taylor\u2019s magazine, American Renaissance, under a pseudonym.\n\n In an October 2016 email, Milo Yiannopoulos described the 28-year-old Saucier as \u201cmy best friend.\u201d Yiannopoulos may have been exaggerating: He was asking his acquaintance the novelist Bret Easton Ellis for a signed copy of American Psycho as a gift for Saucier. But there\u2019s no question the men were close. After a March 2016 dinner together in Georgetown, they kept up a steady correspondence, thrilling over Brexit, approvingly sharing headlines about a Finnish far-right group called \u201cSoldiers of Odin,\u201d and making plans to attend Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle at the Kennedy Center. Saucier \u2014 who did not respond to numerous requests for comment \u2014 clearly illustrates the direct connection between open white nationalists and their fellow travelers at Breitbart. By spring 2016, Yiannopoulos had begun to use him as a sounding board, intellectual guide, and editor. On May 1, Yiannopoulos emailed Saucier asking for readings related to class-based affirmative action; Saucier responded with a half dozen links on the subject, which American Renaissance often covers. On May 3, Saucier sent Yiannopoulos an email titled \u201cArticle idea\u201d: \u201cHow trolls could win the general for Trump.\u201d Yiannopoulos forwarded the email to Bokhari and wrote, \u201cDrop what you\u2019re doing and draft this for me.\u201d An article under Yiannopoulos\u2019s byline appeared the next day. Also in early May, Saucier advised Yiannopoulos and put him in touch with a source for a story about the alt-right\u2019s obsession with Taylor Swift. Saucier also seems to have had enough clout with Yiannopoulos to get him to kill a story. On May 9, the Breitbart tech editor sent Saucier a full draft of the class-based affirmative action story. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t good,\u201d Saucier wrote back, along with a complex explanation of how \u201ctrue class-based affirmative action\u201d would cause \u201cblack enrollment at all decent colleges\u201d to be \u201cdecimated.\u201d The next day, Yiannopoulos wrote back, \u201cI feel suitably admonished,\u201d with another draft. In response, after speculating that Yiannopoulos was trying to \u201csoft pedal\u201d racial differences in intelligence, Saucier wrote, \u201cI would honestly spike this piece.\u201d The story never ran. At other times, though, Yiannopoulos\u2019s writing delighted the young white nationalist. On June 20, Yiannopoulos sent Saucier a link to his story \u201cMilo On Why Britain Should Leave The EU \u2014 To Stop Muslim Immigration.\u201d \u201cNice work,\u201d Saucier responded. \u201cI especially like the references to European identity and the Western greats.\u201d On June 25, Yiannopoulos sent Saucier a copy of an analysis, \u201cBrexit: Why The Globalists Lost.\u201d \u201cSubtle truth bomb,\u201d Saucier responded via email to the sentence \u201cBritain, like Israel and other high-IQ, high-skilled economies, will thrive on its own.\u201d (IQ differences among races are a fixation of American Renaissance.) \u201cProbably beats my \u2018bite the pillow, I\u2019m going in dry\u2019 strategy,\u201d Saucier wrote back. On occasion Yiannopoulos didn\u2019t ease his masters at Breitbart in gently enough. Frequently, Alex Marlow\u2019s job editing him came down to rejecting anti-Semitic and racist ideas and jokes. In April 2016, Yiannopoulos tried to secure approval for the neo-Nazi hacker \u201cWeev\u201d Auernheimer, the system administrator for the Daily Stormer, to appear on his podcast. \u201cGreat provocative guest,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the funniest, smartest and most interesting people I know. ... Very on brand for me.\u201d\n\nThere were also signs that Bannon was using his proximity to the Republican nominee to promote the culture war pet causes that he and Yiannopoulos shared. On October 13, Saucier emailed Yiannopoulos a tweet from the white nationalist leader Nathan Damigo, who went on to punch a woman in the face at a Berkeley rally in April of this year and led marchers in Charlottesville: \u201c@realDonaldTrump just said he would protect free speech on college campus.\u201d \u201cHe used phrases extremely close to what I say \u2014 Bannon is feeding him,\u201d Yiannopoulos responded. Yet, by the early days of the Trump presidency \u2014 and as the harder and more explicitly bigoted elements within the alt-right fought to reclaim the term \u2014 Bannon had clearly established a formal distance from Yiannopoulos. On February 14, Yiannopoulos, who months earlier had worked hand in glove with Bannon, asked their mutual PR rep for help reaching him. \u201cHere\u2019s the book manuscript, to be kept confidential of course\u2026 still hoping for a Bannon or Don Jr or Ivanka endorsement!\u201d The next week, video appeared in which Yiannopoulos appeared to condone pedophilia. He resigned from Breitbart under pressure two days later, but not before his attorney beseeched Solov and Marlow to keep him. \u201cWe implore you not to discard this rising star over a 13 month old video that we all know does not reflect his true views,\u201d the lawyer wrote. Bannon, ensconced in the chaotic Trump White House, didn\u2019t comment, nor did he reach out to Yiannopoulos on his main email. But the machine wasn\u2019t broken, just running quietly. And it wouldn\u2019t jettison such a valuable component altogether, even after seeming to endorse pedophilia. After firing Yiannopoulos, Marlow accompanied him to the Mercers\u2019 Palm Beach home to discuss a new venture: MILO INC. On February 27, not quite two weeks after the scandal erupted, Yiannopoulos received an email from a woman who described herself as \u201cRobert Mercer\u2019s accountant.\u201d \u201cWe will be sending a wire payment today,\u201d she wrote. Later that day, in an email to the accountant and Robert Mercer, Yiannopoulos personally thanked his patron. And as Yiannopoulos prepared to publish his book, he stayed close enough to Rebekah Mercer to ask her by text for a recommendation when he needed a periodontist in New York. Since Bannon left the White House, there have been signs that the two men may be collaborating again. On August 18, Yiannopoulos posted to Instagram a black-and-white photo of Bannon with the caption \u201cWinter is Coming.\u201d Though he ultimately didn\u2019t show, Bannon was originally scheduled to speak at Yiannopoulos\u2019s Free Speech Week at UC Berkeley. (The event, which was supposed to feature an all-star lineup of far-right personalities, was canceled last month, reportedly after the student group sponsoring it failed to fill out necessary paperwork.) And Yiannopoulos has told those close to him that he expects to be back at Breitbart soon. Steve Bannon\u2019s actions are often analyzed through the lens of his professed ideology, that of an anti-Islam, anti-immigrant, anti-\u201cGlobalist\u201d crusader bent on destroying prevailing liberal ideas about immigration, diversity, and economics. To be sure, much of that comes through in the documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. The \u201cCamp of the Saints\u201d Bannon is there, demanding Yiannopoulos change \u201crefugee\u201d to \u201cmigrant\u201d in a February 2016 story, speaking of the #war for the West. Still, it is less often we think about Bannon simply as a media executive in charge of a private company. Any successful media executive produces content to expand audience size. The Breitbart alt-right machine, embodied by Milo Yiannopoulos, may read most clearly in this context. It was a brilliant audience expansion machine, financed by billionaires, designed to draw in people disgusted by some combination of identity politics, Muslim and Hispanic immigration, and the idea of Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama in the White House. And if expanding that audience meant involving white nationalists and neo-Nazis, their participation could always be laundered to hide their contributions. Yiannopoulos\u2019s brand is his ego. Yet his role within the media ecosystem \u2014 building an audience around identity politics in the era of news organizations relying on social media for growth \u2014 makes him far less unique than he might believe. More and more outlets are firing writers and dumping resources into video. Given that trend, and particularly after Charlottesville, when the alt-right has proved a troublesome audience to court, it\u2019s possible that Yiannopoulos\u2019s use to Bannon has dwindled. Or perhaps it hasn\u2019t. For Bannon, of course, Yiannopoulos\u2019s future was always in video, in spectacle. 2017 has provided plenty of spectacles that have gotten great ratings. Before it imploded, Free Speech Week had the potential to be the latest. And the two men know the value of making a scene. In June 2016, Yiannopoulos, with Bannon\u2019s enthusiastic support, planned to lead a gay pride march through a \u201cMuslim ghetto\u201d in Stockholm. Though Breitbart would later cancel the event over security concerns \u2014 Yiannopoulos expressed concern in private repeatedly \u2014 the Breitbart tech editor was in joking good spirits on June 26 when he wrote to Bannon of a \u201ckiller plan.\u201d \u201cIf I die doing this I expect a blackout on Breitbart.com for AT LEAST this afternoon,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote. \u201cAnd miss all the traffic in condolences?\u201d \u25cf"}, "https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/6c7utq/the_donald_has_gone_private_in_protest_of_their/": {"title": "The_donald has gone private in protest of their clash with the admins \u2022 r/SubDrama", "keywords": ["reddit", " reddit.com", " vote", " comment", " submit"], "url": "https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/6c7utq/the_donald_has_gone_private_in_protest_of_their/", "text": ""}}, "socialism": {"http://professorwatchlist.org/index.php/about-us": {"title": "About Us", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://professorwatchlist.org/index.php/about-us", "text": ""}, "http://reverepress.com/news/danica-roem-just-became-first-transgender-state-lawmaker/": {"title": "The man who wrote the anti-trans bathroom bill just lost to a trans woman", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://reverepress.com/news/danica-roem-just-became-first-transgender-state-lawmaker/", "text": "Democrat Danica Roem defeated Republican Bob Marshall to represent Virginia\u2019s 13th district in the state\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nRoem, 33, became the country\u2019s only current openly transgender state legislator Tuesday night.

When it fulminates about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, it forgets that it literally built Iran\u2019s first nuclear reactor. When it treats North Korea\u2019s anti-Americanism as deranged, it forgets that time we flattened the entire country by dropping 32,000 tons of napalm on its cities. When a terrorist says he tried to blow up Times Square to punish America for drone strikes on Muslims, the country wonders what he could possibly be referring to. When the country denounced Saddam Hussein for supposedly possessing weapons of mass destruction, it forgot that it had previously knowingly provided military aid to Saddam Hussein while he was launching chemical attacks on Iranians. (Foreign Policy said this made the U.S. \u201ccomplicit[] in some of the most gruesome chemical weapons attacks ever launched.\u201d)\n\nOne aspect of this national forgetting is the rehabilitation and praise of truly horrible people. Exhibit A in this is, of course, Henry Kissinger, who (1) helped Richard Nixon prolong the Vietnam War in order to win an election, resulting in the violent deaths of countless Vietnamese children (2) organized the illegal dropping of millions of tons of bombs on Laos and Cambodia (3) offered tacit U.S. support for mass murder in East Timor, and, well, the list goes on. Now Kissinger is a friend to Republican and Democrat alike, with Hillary Clinton gushing about his books and \u201chuman rights\u201d advocate Samantha Power taking him to Yankees games.\n\nBut Kissinger is only an unusually striking example: powerful men are constantly having their misdeeds overlooked, or being treated as humane and decent without any evidence to show that they are. George W. Bush, of course, now enjoys a high favorable rating among Democrats, with everyone having quickly forgotten the half-million deaths he is responsible for or the various people his administration tortured. Bill Clinton manipulated and betrayed black people throughout his career, using Haitian suffering as a photo op and denying the Rwandan genocide, but was portrayed as the first black president. Bob Kerrey participated in the mass slaughter of women and children but was made a U.S. senator and university president. The severity of the offenses ranges widely, but the pattern is the same. Hugh Hefner treated women as concubines and was warmly eulogized for somehow liberating them. Bill Kristol and Max Boot penned intellectual justifications for a war crime, and they\u2019re still respected commentators. Or just look at Andrew Jackson, not just responsible for owning slaves and killing indigenous people but for a forgotten atrocity against black people that nobody ever talks about! (Also: I don\u2019t mean to get all \u201cidentity politics\u201d on you, but these Respectable Monsters are usually, let\u2019s be honest, rich white men.)\n\nJust look at Ronald Reagan: Reagan\u2019s administration famously supported the Contras in Nicaragua (through selling missiles to the Iranian regime in violation of an arms embargo!) and mass murdering guerrillas in El Salvador. But he also provided tens of millions of dollars to the Guatemalan military as they literally committed genocide against the country\u2019s indigenous people. (That genocide doesn\u2019t count as something America forgot, because we never bothered to notice it in the first place.) Today, Ronald Reagan is routinely voted the greatest American president, and even the greatest American of all time, despite having done little beyond presenting an affable and reassuring presence on television.\n\nI suspect that Donald Trump, too, will have his day of redemption.\n\nLast night was Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech. It was part political boilerplate, part scary rhetoric about immigrants and terrorism, and part bragging about the stock market and the unemployment rate. Because Trump stuck to his script, however, the address was not full of the vulgar, incoherent digressions that usually distinguish Trump\u2019s speech. It felt ordinary. According to one poll, it was positively received by nearly all Republicans and almost half of Democrats. And that should be a serious concern to those of us who find Trump horrifying. The next stop beyond \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201cbenign\u201d is \u201cpresidential.\u201d\n\nOf course, there were the usual flurries of fact-checks from pundits who detest Trump\u2019s crass car-salesman personality. But even Nick Kristof, in conducting his most \u201cbrutal\u201d possible examination of Trump\u2019s statements, conceded that:\n\n\u201cTeleprompter Trump goes over so much better than Twitter Trump. If the Republican National Committee confiscated the president\u2019s phone, Republicans would be much better off. We all would be!\u201d\n\nWould we be, though? Because Teleprompter Trump and Twitter Trump don\u2019t actually do anything differently, they just present themselves differently to the public. Twitter Trump looks like an ass, while Teleprompter Trump looks like\u2026 a president. In Kristof\u2019s statement, we can see a hint that if Trump cleaned up his act, if he followed conventions about decorum and dignity, many who loathe him wouldn\u2019t have nearly as much of a problem with him, even if he still kept the same number of immigrant children in detention centers.\n\nTrump also happened to call up that magical word: bipartisanship. \u201cA call for bipartisanship\u201d ran the headline in the next day\u2019s Washington Post. But as Luke Savage has written here before, bipartisanship is a dangerous word: the things that \u201cboth parties\u201d can agree on often end up being horrible, like further bloating the military or increasing government surveillance powers. And sure enough, when we look at Trump\u2019s speech, there is good reason to be worried. Trump called blandly for consensus and collaboration, saying \u201cI am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.\u201d But immediately before in the speech, he had been scaremongering about MS-13 and demanding a \u201cfix\u201d to immigration and more support for ICE and the Border Patrol.\n\nAny bipartisan immigration policy that gives an inch to Trump will probably be a humanitarian disaster. As my colleague Brianna Rennix has shown, the Trump administration\u2019s plans will hurt vulnerable people fleeing violence. They will tear families apart. They are fundamentally based on a callous indifference to the lives of non-citizens. It\u2019s so bad that The Wall is actually the least worrisome aspect of the Trump immigration agenda. Democrats need to resist calls for Consensus on this, because immigration needs to be seen as the fight that it is.\n\nAn unbelievable amount of words has been produced from liberals and leftists on why Donald Trump is an aberrant, incompetent, and evil man who should not be running a country. And there have been plenty of calls not to \u201cnormalize\u201d Trump by forgetting that he is these things. For my own part, I have sometimes suggested the opposite: that Trump is actually not terribly different from many other U.S. presidents in his actions, and that he would actually fit well into the contemporary Republican party if he wasn\u2019t such a vulgarian.\n\nPerhaps what I should most fear, though, is that people start to agree with that, to see Donald Trump as just another president. As we continue the inevitable process of getting used to him, perhaps people will start to forget why they were ever outraged, and begin to think \u201cWell, you know, he\u2019s not so terrible after all. And after all, he believes in bipartisanship.\u201d This is what has happened with George W. Bush.\n\nIt\u2019s also what happened with Ronald Reagan. Reagan, too, was initially seen as a clown and a ninny, even among Republicans. Frank Rich, in a long essay comparing Reagan\u2019s political ascent to Trump\u2019s, quotes a Republican consultant saying that \u201cthe other major GOP players \u2014 especially Easterners and moderates \u2014 thought Reagan was a certified yahoo.\u201d But once Reagan defied expectations, everyone simply lied and pretended they\u2019d been with him from the beginning. Reagan was an airheaded actor, a man as unpresidential as they come. But being seen as \u201cunpresidential\u201d is easily cured by spending a few years as president. As the reality adjusts, so do people\u2019s understandings of the term.\n\nDon\u2019t count on Trump\u2019s lies (frequently, the main thing he is critiqued for) to prevent him from being respected. After all, Rich says:\n\n\u201c[Reagan routinely disgorged] fantasies and factual errors so prolific and often outrageous that he single-handedly made the word \u2018gaffe\u2019 a permanent fixture in America\u2019s political vernacular. He confused Pakistan with Afghanistan. He claimed that trees contributed 93 percent of the atmosphere\u2019s nitrous oxide and that pollution in America was \u2018substantially under control\u2019 even as his hometown of Los Angeles was suffocating in smog.\u201d\n\nRich collects evidence of a \u201cproto-Trump\u201d style evident in Reagan, who was also willing to engage in shows of \u201cbipartisanship,\u201d and who was written off by Jimmy Carter because he had a \u201cpenchant for offering simplistic solutions to hideously complex problems.\u201d He was treated by liberal commentators as \u201cnot a serious candidate for president\u201d and \u201ca shame and embarrassment for the country.\u201d He was mocked as \u201cthe Candidate from Disneyland,\u201d and someone apparently tried to make the name \u201cRonald Duck\u201d stick. (Even that has its contemporary echoes.)\n\nNone of this prevented Reagan from being treated as an ordinary president in the long run. And not even \u201cordinary\u201d: Reagan is revered. He\u2019s not just \u201ca president\u201d or \u201ca good president\u201d but the best president, better than the one who founded the country or the one who ended slavery or the one who defeated Hitler. (Actually 20 million Russians defeated Hitler, but let\u2019s not quibble.) The country\u2019s five-second collective memory means that in retrospect, Reagan is not seen how his contemporaries saw him, but how he portrayed himself. It doesn\u2019t matter what you are, it matters what you pretend to be, and if you stick with it long enough people will probably start to believe it.\n\nDonald Trump would like to displace Reagan as the Greatest President of All Time. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how he\u2019ll think of himself, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how he\u2019ll portray himself. And why shouldn\u2019t the same process benefit him that has benefited all the rest of them? It won\u2019t happen this year, or next year, but twenty or thirty years from now? I can see it. The Trump self-myth will have displaced the reality, just as it has through his entire career.\n\nYou might laugh. America will never treat some callous and stupid fool as a brilliant man. This country could never venerate a man so silly, one who offers people nothing but myths and false promises. But it\u2019s worth remembering what Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign slogan was: Let\u2019s Make America Great Again.\n\nIf you appreciate our work, please consider making a donation or purchasing a subscription.

The listed crimes include such offenses as drug possession, domestic violence, and DUIs, also making a point to note the immigrant\u2019s country of origin.\n\nMany of the immigrants listed, it should be noted, have not yet been convicted of their crimes.\n\nIt has become something of a cliche in contemporary politics to compare an unpopular figure to the practices of Nazi Germany, but this report is quite literally straight out of Hitler\u2019s playbook. The Nazi newspaper Der Sturmer ran a regular segment titled the \u201cLetter Box,\u201d which regularly published accounts of Jewish crimes. The segment was launched by Hitler\u2019s operatives after the majority of Germans did not participate in a boycott of Jewish businesses in April 1933 as a way to inflame anti-Semitic sentiment.\n\nTrump\u2019s rise to power has also relied on stoking hatred, largely against Mexican immigrants and Muslims. He famously began his political career by suggesting that the vast majority of Mexican immigrants were \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d despite the well-documented fact that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a lower rates than American citizens.\n\nThese new reports have largely been interpreted as a way to scapegoat sanctuary cities who refuse to fall in line with his anti-immigrant agenda.\n\nTrump has raged against sanctuary cities since the beginning of his presidency, seeing them as an unacceptable defiance of his authority. Within the first week of being in office, he signed an executive order which enabled the federal government to withhold federal funds to sanctuary cities, despite the fact that these cities tend to cooperate with federal law enforcement requests. They simply do not inquire about a person\u2019s immigration status when they are arrested for a crime, nor do they aggressively pursue deportations on a local level.\n\n\u201cThe federal government can\u2019t demand that state officials or local officials do their work,\u201d said constitutional law scholar Barry Friedman, citing the Tenth Amendment and the Supreme court precedent called Printz v. United States.\n\n\u201cWhen law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE\u2019s ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission,\u201d Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement.\n\nHowever, critics of this new precedent, including Rep. Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois, say that this will only make law enforcement\u2019s jobs more difficult.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s presidency is based on a number of lies, but one of the most important to Bannon, Trump, and Sessions is to paint all immigrants as killers and rapists,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201cThe reality is that in most cities, the police have found that acting as deportation police makes it harder to keep their cities safe.\u201d\n\nNathan Wellman is a Los Angeles-based journalist, author, and playwright.

Trump is aiming to sign the tax package into law before Christmas. \"Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate,\" he tweeted inaccurately. The overhaul is significant but far from the largest.\n\nPresiding over the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence announced the 51-49 vote to applause from Republicans. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., was the only lawmaker to cross party lines, joining the Democrats in opposition. The measure focuses its tax reductions on businesses and higher-earning individuals, gives more modest breaks to others and offers the boldest rewrite of the nation's tax system since 1986.\n\nRepublicans said the package would benefit people of all incomes and ignite the economy. Even an official projection of a $1 trillion, 10-year flood of deeper budget deficits couldn't dissuade GOP senators from rallying behind the bill.\n\n\"Obviously I'm kind of a dinosaur on the fiscal issues,\" said Corker, who battled to keep the bill from worsening the government's accumulated $20 trillion in IOUs.\n\nThe Republican-led House approved a similar bill last month in what has been a stunningly quick trip through Congress for complex legislation. Democrats derided the hastily written, scribbles-in -the-margin crafting of the bill in the final hours Friday night.\n\nAfter spending the year's first nine months futilely trying to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, GOP leaders were determined to move the measure rapidly before opposition Democrats and lobbying groups could blow it up. The party views passage as crucial to retaining its House and Senate majorities in next year's elections.\n\nDemocrats dismissed the bill as a gift to its wealthy and business backers at the expense of lower-earning people. They played up the fact that the bill would permanently reduce corporate tax rates, from 35 percent to 20 percent, while offering only temporary tax cuts to individuals, lasting until 2026.\n\nCongress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has said the bill's reductions for many families would be modest and by 2027, families earning under $75,000 would on average face higher, not lower, taxes.\n\nThe bill is \"removed from the reality of what the American people need,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. He criticized Republicans for releasing a revised, 479-page bill that no one could absorb shortly before the final vote, saying, \"The Senate is descending to a new low of chicanery.\"\n\n\"You really don't read this kind of legislation,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told home-state reporters, saying senators focus on the major provisions as opposed to the \"mind numbing\" comparisons to current law.\n\nDemocrats took to the Senate floor and social media to mock one page that included changes scrawled in barely legible handwriting. Later, they won enough GOP support to kill a provision by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have bestowed a tax break on conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan.\n\nThe bill hit rough waters after the Joint Taxation panel concluded it would worsen federal shortfalls by $1 trillion over a decade, even when factoring in economic growth that lower taxes would stimulate. Trump administration officials and many Republicans have insisted the bill would pay for itself by stimulating the economy. But the sour projections stiffened resistance from some deficit-averse Republicans.\n\nBut after bargaining that stretched into Friday, GOP leaders nailed down the support they needed in a chamber they control, 52-48. Facing unyielding Democratic opposition, Republicans could lose no more than two GOP senators and prevail with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, but ended up not needing it.\n\nLate changes introduced by GOP leaders included helping millions of companies whose owners pay individual, not corporate, taxes on their profits by allowing deductions of 23 percent, up from 17.4 percent. That helped win over Wisconsin's Johnson and Steve Daines of Montana.\n\nPeople would be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes, a demand of Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. That matched a House provision to keep some GOP votes from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.\n\nThe changes added nearly $300 billion to the tax bill's costs. To pay for that, leaders decided not to erase the alternative minimum tax. Instead, they reduced the number of high-earners who must pay it. They also increased a one-time tax on profits U.S.-based corporations are holding overseas and they would require firms to keep paying the business version of the alternative minimum tax.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. \u2014 who like Corker had been a holdout and has sharply attacked Trump's capabilities as president \u2014 voted for the bill. He said he'd received commitments from party leaders and the administration \"to work with me\" to restore protections, dismantled by Trump, for young immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. That seemed short of a pledge to actually revive the safeguards.\n\nThe Senate bill would drop the highest personal income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent. The estate tax levied on a few thousand of the nation's largest inheritances would be narrowed to affect even fewer.\n\nDeductions for state and local income taxes, moving expenses and other items would vanish, the standard deduction \u2014 used by most Americans \u2014 would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples, and the per-child tax credit would grow.\n\nThe bill would abolish the \"Obamacare\" requirement that most people buy health coverage or face tax penalties. Industry experts say that would weaken the law by easing pressure on healthier people to buy coverage, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the move would push premiums higher and leave 13 million additional people uninsured.\n\nDrilling would be allowed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Another provision, knocked out because it violated Senate budget rules, would have explicitly let parents buy tax-advantaged 529 college savings accounts for fetuses, a step they can already take but which anti-abortion forces wanted inscribed into law. There were also breaks for the wine, beer and spirits industries, Alaska Natives and aircraft management firms.\n\nAssociated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Richard Lardner in Washington and Scott Bauer Milwaukee contributed to this report."}, "https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/06/the-clintons-had-slaves": {"title": "The Clintons Had Slaves | Current Affairs", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/06/the-clintons-had-slaves", "text": "Contrary to popular understanding, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution did not prohibit slavery. The text makes it clear:\n\nNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\nThe nifty little loophole of that word \u201cexcept\u201d means that slavery isn\u2019t actually banned outright; someone simply has to be convicted of a crime in order to be enslaved. This gave Southern states a welcome free hand in re-establishing forced servitude for African Americans in the years after Reconstruction collapsed; as Douglas Blackmon documents in Slavery By Another Name, the Jim Crow era was in many places characterized by a mass re-enslavement process, whereby criminal laws were devised that allowed states and municipalities to put black people in chains again. Today, forced labor among African Americans persists; in Louisiana, for example, felons are sentenced to \u201chard labor\u201d as well as prison time, and inmates at the infamous Angola prison still pick cotton at gunpoint.\n\nThe prison labor system in the United States has long been an unacknowledged scandal. It\u2019s quite plainly a form of slavery. The Thirteenth Amendment even admits as much: it doesn\u2019t say that when you\u2019re forced to work for being convicted of a crime, that isn\u2019t slavery. It says that slavery is legal if it is imposed as part of a conviction for a crime. All manner of people benefit from the system; as Mother Jones has reported, Congress actually incentivized private companies to use inmate labor, and the incarcerated now produce everything from bedding to eyeglasses. They even staff call centers, with a company called UNICOR encouraging companies to \u201csmart-source\u201d their call-center work to prisoners rather than sending it overseas.\n\nBut two possibly unexpected beneficiaries of the contemporary prison slavery system were none other than Bill and Hillary Clinton, who during their time at the Arkansas governor\u2019s mansion in the 1980\u2019s used inmates to perform various household tasks in order to \u201ckeep costs down.\u201d Hillary Clinton wrote of the practice openly and without any apparent sense of moral conflict.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 practice has gotten some renewed attention over the last day, with the rediscovery of the relevant passage from It Takes a Village. Last year I wrote a bit about Hillary\u2019s admission in my book Superpredator: Bill Clinton\u2019s Use and Abuse of Black America:\n\nClinton was, however, generous enough to allow inmates from Arkansas prisons to work as unpaid servants in the Governor\u2019s Mansion. In It Takes a Village, Hillary Clinton writes that the residence was staffed with \u201cAfrican-American men in their thirties,\u201d since \u201cusing prison labor at the governor\u2019s mansion was a longstanding tradition, which kept down costs.\u201d It is unclear just how longstanding the tradition of having chained black laborers brought to work as maids and gardeners had been. But one has no doubt that as the white residents of a mansion staffed with unpaid blacks, the Clintons were continuing a certain historic Southern practice. (Hillary Clinton did note, however, that she and Bill were sure not to show undue lenience to the sla\u2026servants, writing that \u201c[w]e enforced rules strictly and sent back to prison any inmate who broke a rule.\u201d\n\nIndeed it\u2019s really difficult, given the facts, to conclude that this practice was anything other than slavery. The Clintons were perfectly content to be waited on by black people who received no compensation and would have been pursued and dragged back in chains if they had tried to leave. There is only one word for such an arrangement.\n\nOne could almost respect the honesty with which Hillary spoke of her use of convict labor. She acknowledges that these men were black, and that she had a strict policy of sending them back to prison if they violated any rules. But Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t like the Atlantic writer who dwelled on his upbringing as part of a family who held a woman in a state of slavery. Her forthrightness in It Takes a Village is not because she is attempting to grapple with the atrocity in which she was complicit, but because she doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with what happened. Whereas many of us would be appalled at the idea of having our meals served by unpaid black servants, Clinton found the whole situation quaintly traditional, and was favorably impressed by the financial benefits of not paying her staff. What others might call \u201ca crime against human dignity,\u201d Clinton referred to in It Takes a Village as simply \u201can unusual aspect of living at the governor\u2019s mansion.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 use of prison labor was only one small part of a long and horrifying record. Both Clintons, but especially Bill, have consistently manipulated black political interests while showing complete disregard for the humanity of African Americans. This stretches from Hillary\u2019s perpetuation of a hideous racist myth about a wave of hyper-violent \u201csuperpredators\u201d to Bill\u2019s politically-motivated execution of a mentally disturbed black inmate. (I know it\u2019s a crass plug, but there really is far more on this, with a lot of sources, in Superpredator.)\n\nPredictably, when people started to mention how disturbing it was that the Clintons had kept slaves, a few especially committed online Hillary fans began to issue impossibly contorted defenses, including blaming \u201cDudeBros\u201d for bringing the matter up and explaining that Hillary had tried to empathize with the convicts. (To see why the defenses fail, simply imagine how laughable they would seem if applied to any other situation of unpaid black labor, e.g. if a 19th century Southerner offered them.)\n\nBut let\u2019s also be clear: the issue of prison labor isn\u2019t just about the Clintons. I believe the Clintons have an indefensible record of behavior toward black people. But the story of the Clintons in the Arkansas governor\u2019s mansion also just illustrates how ubiquitous and taken-for-granted situations of slavery are. It\u2019s very easy to think \u201cBut that couldn\u2019t possibly be slavery, the state is just assigning inmates to an interesting work detail.\u201d Yet if we examine the facts critically, it\u2019s hard to see how it could be anything else. Prison labor doesn\u2019t seem like slavery because it no longer displays some of the imagery associated with slavery in our minds, such as the whippings and the auction blocks. But we\u2019re still dealing with a situation in which people are working by compulsion rather than choice, and are threatened with violence if they leave. They are leased to corporations, as if they are property. The auction block may be gone, but the core aspect of slavery is not that people are bought and sold. Rather, it\u2019s about the kind of dominance that is asserted over them. (After all, slavery can exist even if one party has a monopoly on slaveowning. It\u2019s the forced labor and the experience of the slave that counts, not the trading element.)\n\nOf course, one could draw a distinction between \u201cslavery\u201d (in which a person asserts all rights over a human being, including the right to sell them and their children and to take their life) and \u201cinvoluntary servitude\u201d (in which a person is simply forced to work), a distinction such as the Thirteenth Amendment contemplates. But \u201cinvoluntary servitude\u201d immediately begins to sound like little more than a euphemism for slavery, and many of the situations that modern anti-slavery advocates would consider to be slavery\u2014such as that perpetrated by Alex Tizon\u2018s family\u2014do not necessarily include people being murdered and having their children sold. (Though they sometimes do.) It is important never to minimize the distinct horrors of early American slavery, but the term also applies to situations in which the victims are treated comparatively \u201cwell,\u201d and which are not characterized by all of the worst features of the pre-Civil War South. Thus I do think it\u2019s fair to classify prison labor as a form of enslavement. Degrees of force obviously vary, but since the Angola prison plantation today looks exactly the same as it did in the 19th century, I believe the word helps us appreciate the evils of mass incarceration rather than diminishing the evils of the antebellum era.\n\nThe Clinton slavery controversy should not really be about the Clintons. It\u2019s the prison labor system as a whole that is rotten, and they were only two especially amoral beneficiaries of it. Today, our attention should be focused on the cotton-pickers of Louisiana and the scores of other modern-day slaves. This is not a mere pathology of the Clintons, but a pathology of the country we all inhabit. And it is not just a single noxious political family that is complicit. We all are."}, "https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/06/16/what-if-we-had-socialist-government-owning-signed-/": {"title": "YouGov | What if we had a socialist government; Owning a signed copy of Mein Kampf; Fame and personality", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/06/16/what-if-we-had-socialist-government-owning-signed-/", "text": ""}, "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/09/12/i-watched-my-patients-die-of-poverty-for-40-years-its-time-for-single-payer/": {"title": "Perspective | I watched my patients die of poverty for 40 years.

A liver transplant could have cured her, but she was uninsured and was denied an appointment at two prominent Chicago transplant hospitals, including my own. Sarai\u2019s plight was brought to my attention when a local religious group held a hunger strike advocating transplant access for Sarai and other uninsured patients. When she died, her congregation marched seven miles, holding her photograph and lugging coffins emblazoned with her name, to launch a sit-in in front of Northwestern University Hospital. Her death certificate named liver disease as her cause of death, but that\u2019s not true. The real cause was inequality. If the United States had a Medicare-for-all health insurance system, she might have been saved.\n\nIn nearly 40 years as a doctor, I witnessed time and again how inequality kills. Those without health insurance, such as Sarai (there are almost 30 million in the country), often cannot access the most basic care, let alone complex specialty care. But the problem is more serious than a simple lack of health insurance. What insurance card you hold can literally be a matter of life and death.\n\nConsider how our current multi-payer health insurance system affects hospitals, clinics and patients. I have practiced at three hospitals along a two-mile strip of Ogden Avenue in Chicago. I spent 17 years at Cook County Hospital, now the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, rising from intern to chief of general medicine. When I practiced at Cook County Hospital, it was largely a hospital for the uninsured. Despite many improvements, largely because of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, many services, such as screening colonoscopies and hip replacements, are still beyond reach for patients and their doctors. I spent a decade at Mount Sinai Hospital, a not-for-profit hospital for the poor in North Lawndale, a neighborhood of concentrated poverty in Chicago. Sinai cares for a mostly minority population that is mostly uninsured or on Medicaid. In my 27 years at these two safety-net hospitals, not one of my patients received an organ or bone marrow transplant. Yet the organs that fed the transplant centers across the region came from the dying patients in these hospitals. Our patients \u2014 the poorest of the poor \u2014 gave, but they never received.\n\nFor the past 12 years, I have practiced at Rush University Medical Center, an academic medical center replete with the finest care biomedicine can offer. Because my hospital serves a variety of patients with different insurance types \u2014 many with private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, and some uninsured \u2014 it is able to afford and offer a vast array of services. But those with the wrong insurance card cannot access the care at my hospital. In contrast, hospitals that only serve the poor and uninsured, such as my two prior hospitals, are more limited in their scope because the payment systems for the uninsured and those on Medicaid constrain their ability to buy new equipment or invest as they need. Compared with Cook County and Mount Sinai, Rush felt like a different planet my patients and I had landed on, where previously out-of-reach medical care was now available.\n\nI realized that all the doctors and nurses in the world could not cure health-care inequity if the insurance system itself was the problem.\n\nI call my experience on Ogden Avenue \u201cone street, two worlds\u201d because that short stretch of asphalt separates two very different worlds of health and health care: one for those institutions who have patients with better health insurance, and one for those for hospitals who largely serve patients with limited or no insurance.\n\nMy experiences also reflect the observations of Princeton economist Angus Deaton, who noted that the United States virtually has an apartheid health-care system. As structural racism has concentrated black and brown poverty into certain Zip codes, the hospitals and clinics serving minority neighborhoods often face severe resource challenges compared with those serving affluent neighborhoods of concentrated advantage. This inequity is only magnified by the way health insurance has been distributed across America. But it not just the poorest who are at risk. Our current multi-payer for-profit health insurance system perpetuates premature death by putting many people at an extreme disadvantage when it comes to affording care. Those who have better health insurance policies can access better care. However, even patients with insurance cards face skyrocketing co-pays, deductibles and pharmaceutical prices that keep them from seeking care. Last year, 27 percent of Americans said they had postponed or avoided getting care they needed because of the cost; 23 percent said they had skipped a recommended test or treatment due to cost; and 21 percent said they had chosen not to fill prescriptions for medication because they couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nDeath rates tell the same story. Since 1980, there have been dramatic gains in life expectancy for the top 20 percent of U.S. earners. At the same time, the poorest 20 percent have seen their life expectancy plummet. While access to health insurance is not the only cause, it certainly contributes to the life expectancy gap. In Canada, with its single-payer health insurance, the life expectancy gap between the rich and the poor narrowed during the same period.\n\n[Single-payer would come with high costs]\n\nThere are three fundamental problems with the patchwork U.S. health insurance landscape that a Medicare-for-all system would resolve. First, our current reliance on for-profit insurance forces working families to pay increasingly burdensome prices for health services and prescription drugs. The Affordable Care Act was never a viable solution, because it relies on the for-profit insurance industry, which is geared to maximize shareholder returns rather than high-quality, low-cost care for all. Meanwhile, taxpayers have funneled billions of dollars to support premiums for individuals and subsidies for insurance companies. Second, Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, shares many of these same flaws. The quality of the program varies by state and is a major burden on state budgets. Finally, the current system is inequitable for low-income or uninsured patients. Every day, people such as Sarai die when they could have been saved.\n\nThe best solution is a national solution; one that has been implemented by nearly every other developed nation. Medicare, the popular insurance program for those over 65 and people with disabilities, has a 90 percent satisfaction rate. Under a Medicare-for-all program, every worker and business in America would pay into the system through a combination of payroll and other taxes and fees, just as we pay taxes and fees for schools, water and the military. There would be no complex health insurance payments to navigate, no prohibitive co-pays and deductibles, no corporate welfare to boost insurance company profits. Untangling health care from employment would not only free workers to change jobs or start new businesses, but would also eliminate the largest and most stealthy tax loophole in the U.S. tax code: the $250 billion annual tax-free subsidy of employer-based health insurance.\n\nMedicare for all would solve the problems of health-care access for the poor and rural. Such a system would allow hospitals and clinics to survive at a time when many of them \u2014 often the largest employers in their communities \u2014 are threatened with extinction. Moreover, it creates the opportunity for America to eliminate health inequities and improve life expectancy because, by design, everyone will be in and no one will be left out.\n\n[GOP senators blew it with repeal-and-replace. So say hello to single-payer.]\n\nAs a doctor, I have a moral obligation to care for patients regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay. But America\u2019s fragmented, for-profit health system forces doctors to violate their Hippocratic oath, the moral contract requiring us to treat health as a basic human right. I speak for many American physicians when I say I am sick and tired of a health insurance system that harms our patients, many of whom are sick and tired themselves.\n\nThe right to health care in America is not an issue of the left or the right. It\u2019s a matter of right and wrong. Winston Churchill reportedly said, \u201cYou can always count on the Americans to do the right thing \u2026 after they have tried everything else.\u201d Today, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will introduce a bill in the Senate that will provide a path forward for Medicare for all. Let\u2019s do the right thing.

Republicans were \u201cdeluding themselves,\u201d said former Obama strategist David Axelrod, to think that voters would reward them for a tax cut.\n\n\u201cThere are two categories of people who will benefit here \u2014 wealthy, corporate interests, of course, who scored a bonanza, and Democratic ad-makers, who have been handed a treasure trove of egregious targets and tawdry, swamp-like images with which to work,\u201d Axelrod said.\n\nThe bill\u2019s progress has not much resembled Washington\u2019s last raids on the tax code. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut passed by super-majorities in the House and the Senate, while President George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 tax cut \u2014 sold at first as a way to spend a surplus, then as a way to combat a recession \u2014 attracted 13 Democratic votes in the House and 12 in the Senate. In 2010, an even larger number of Democrats voted to extend the Bush-era tax rates for people making less than $400,000, fearful that cutting them back would lengthen the Great Recession.\n\nThere was no such worry about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which breaks from recent monetary history by reducing tax revenue in a time of steady economic growth \u2014 conditions in which prior Congresses have tried to reduce the deficit. The Joint Tax Committee estimated that the bill would add more than $1 trillion to the U.S. debt over 10 years; Democrats, attacked for years over the growing national debt, marveled as just one Republican, Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), voted against the bill.\n\nA polling average compiled by FiveThirtyEight found that 46 percent of the public opposes the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, compared to 32 percent who support it. That makes it slightly less popular than the 1993 tax increase that helped Republicans seize Congress from President Bill Clinton\u2019s Democrats.\n\nGuy Cecil, the president of Priorities USA, said surveys show that voters will respond negatively when they learn the details of the legislation.\n\n\u201cWhen Americans find out that the wealthy and big corporations are getting most of the benefits, they oppose it, even when they get something small as well,\u201d Cecil said.\n\nRepublicans were confident that the public would move once the new tax code took effect. Trump, who has inaccurately said that the bill would tax the very wealthy to help working-class Americans, has predicted an economic boom that would lead quickly to employers raising wages.\n\n\u201cMiddle-class families will not only see their tax bill go down, they will see their incomes go up by an average of around $4,000,\u201d Trump said last week in St. Charles, Mo. \u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re going to cut taxes on American businesses so they will compete for workers, they\u2019ll raise salaries.\u201d\n\nDemocrats see it differently, with the tax bill at the center of their increasingly populist campaign. In Ohio, where Sanders headlined two Saturday rallies, former Consumer Finance Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray, who is widely expected to run for governor, warned middle-class voters that the Trump administration is making it easier to bilk them. Democrats spent Monday and Tuesday attacking the Trump administration for installing Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney atop the agency, and before that, railed against Republicans for undoing a CFPB rule that made it easier to sue banks.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who is up for reelection in 2018, said he plans to use all facets of Trump\u2019s regulatory and tax policies to make a case against him and the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n\u201cThe public by election day will see how this Republican majority is wholly owned by Wall Street on every issue and the administration increasingly resembles a retreat for Goldman Sachs executives,\u201d Brown said in an interview. \u201cWhatever plays into that, whether it\u2019s going after the overtime rule or giving all kinds of breaks to Wall Street, or relaxing environmental rules to clean up Lake Erie, you\u2019ll see what this will all be framed by.\u201d\n\nDayton was one place where Brown would test his theories. In 2016, Trump became the first Republican in 28 years to carry the surrounding Montgomery County, campaigning in the city on a promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. Local Democrats, who had organized protests of the bill, said that the measure risked the \u201cfeds, meds and eds\u201d jobs \u2014 government, health care and education \u2014 that had fueled the area\u2019s comeback.\n\n\u201cWho actually wants this thing?\u201d asked Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, who\u2019s running for the Democratic nomination for governor. \u201cThe Realtors, the governors, the mayors, the universities, the hospitals \u2014 they don\u2019t want it. Who does, except their donors?\u201d\n\nCosta and Kane reported from Washington.

The university is named after William Hofstra, a Dutch immigrant timber baron, who made his millions whacking down the forests of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula and Thoreau\u2019s Maine Woods. In other words, it\u2019s the perfect venue for an evening of pre-packaged stump speeches.\n\n+ The mystery gripping all of Washington is whether Bill Clinton\u2019s former mistress, Gennifer Flowers, will be seated in the front row in a cheeky effort by the Trump team to distract Hillary. In 1992, Flowers infamously quipped that the twin tragedies of the Clinton family were Bill\u2019s crooked penis and Hillary\u2019s fat ankles. A campaign which began in the gutter has now plumbed the lower depths.\n\n+ Apparently there\u2019s room in the hall for Ms. Flowers, but Jill Stein was deemed too dangerous to be in the vicinity of debate. At around 2:30, Dr. Stein was escorted off campus by Hofstra University police.\n\n+ A couple of hours before the debate, the bigoted Republican congressman from Iowa, Steve King, tweeted out that the big question was whether Hillary would be \u201con or off her meds tonight.\u201d King has always been a class act. I\u2019d have thought the question would be better posed to his buddy Trump\u2014a sedated Trump is a domesticated Trump, a safe-space candidate for those all-important housewives of the Philly suburbs. Off the meds, he\u2019s a trigger-warning on full automatic.\n\n+ The pre-debate polls are all over the place. Nate Silver\u2019s 538 reported this morning that Trump would win if the election were held today, while the Moody\u2019s Analytic Model predicts that Hillary will secure 332 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 206. Meanwhile, one of my old profs in the History Department at American University, Allan Lichtman, also predicts a Trump win. About 30 years ago, Lichtman developed a demographic-economic model for forecasting presidential elections. He hasn\u2019t been wrong yet.\n\n+ The polls may be trending Trump\u2019s way, but Hillary still enjoys a staggering financial advantage. While she\u2019s lost the white blue collar workers, she\u2019s decisively won over the billionaire class. Campaign contributions from white billionaires have favored Hillary by a 20-to-1 margin over Trump. Class traitors?\n\n+ Combined net worth of both candidates on stage tonight: $3.11 BILLION. Trump $3 billion (give or take), Clinton $110 million.\n\n+ Annual income of moderators for presidential debates: Matt Lauer $25 million, Lester Holt $5 million, Anderson Cooper $10 million (net worth $100 million), Martha Raddadz $1 million (net worth $8 million), Chris Wallace $1.5 million. So we have a bunch of millionaires interviewing two multi-millionaires about what\u2019s best for the middle class. (The poor can just go fuck themselves.)\n\n+ A new report on the insanely expensive F-35 fighter jet shows that the plane barely flies in cloudy weather. Both candidates support building a fleet of these Cold War relics, as does Bernie Sanders, who wants them based at the airport in Burlington. So should we all. Better to have expensive weapons that don\u2019t work, than cheap ones which do. Spend more, kill less!\n\n+ Hot off the Goldman Sachs wire: Hillary worked to secure lavish tax breaks and subsidies for the reconstruction of Goldman\u2019s $2 billion NYC headquarters after 9/11. Later she attended the opulent Grand Opening to the sparkling new financial slaughterhouse. Sanders didn\u2019t bring up the billion dollar courtesy, when asked in Democratic debates to cite quid pro quo for Goldman speeches. Will Trump?\n\n+ Lester Holt is not your usual talking head. For starters, he\u2019s black and of Jamaican descent. Endearingly, he dropped out of Sacramento State to host a country and western radio show and never took a degree. Holt burnished his resum\u00e9 by broadcasting the Westminster Kennel Club\u2019s dog show championships twice and spent several years on the History Channel reporting on various 9/11 conspiracies and the mysterious \u201ccrystal skulls\u201d of the Mayan culture. \u201cCould the skulls be ancient Mayan prophecies of doom or relics from the Lost City of Atlantis?\u201d Holt asked. \u201cOr do they, as some believe, store the vast knowledge of a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization?\u201d In the end, after several hours of penetrating study, Holt failed to a satisfactory answer to these troubling questions. So don\u2019t expect much pesky fact-checking tonight.\n\n+ Last week, in a pre-emptive strike Trump denounced Holt as a politically biased reporter. As with so many of Trump\u2019s pot-shots, this one backfired gloriously. (I don\u2019t think ISIS has much to worry about from him.) \u201cBy the way, Lester is a Democrat,\u201d Trump brayed. \u201cIt\u2019s a phony system. They are all Democrats.\u201d Holt is, in fact, one of those rarities that Trump has been trying futilely (I wonder why) to court: a black Republican.\n\nChris Wallace, the FoxNews reporter who vowed not to do any fact-checking, is the only registered Democrat, who will act as a designator inquisitor of the candidates. (That figures, eh?)\n\n+ Trump is a living testimony to Napoleon\u2019s maxim that \u201cIn politics, stupidity is not a handicap.\u201d\n\n+ Speaking of stupidity, the debate is geared at winning over \u201cundecided voters.\u201d\n\n+ Holt, who landed his position as NBC Nightly News Anchor after Brian Williams fabulated his record as a war correspondent, is a relatively passive interviewer, not known to press his subjects. On the other hand, he has spent time on the ground in places like Haiti, Afghanistan and Libya, getting a first hand look at the carnage inflicted by Hillary\u2019s \u201cSmart Power\u201d foreign policy. Let\u2019s see if he can get beyond Benghazi to the corrupt heart of the matter.\n\n+ Since the moment Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton, the Queen of Chaos has scrubbed any mention of the perils of climate change from her prepared speeches. Perhaps Lester Holt will venture to ask a question about this vexing subject tonight. He could start with a story from today\u2019s news: \u201cUnder Obama US will fail to meet emission targets.\u201d\n\n+ There will be enough hot air emitted from the stage tonight to insure that September\u2019s temperatures break August\u2019s record for hottest month in the modern history of the Earth.\n\n+ In related news, the Obama administration quietly announced today drastic rule changes that will substantially weaken the Endangered Species Act by placing complicated and intractable burdens on environmental groups working to protect rare species. The rule changes are deemed a huge gift to the timber, mining and oil cartels. Too bad Jill Stein won\u2019t be on stage to highlight this betrayal.\n\n+ In the last 30 days, Hillary Clinton has spent more than $50 million. Over that time she has dropped 10 points in the polls. So she has a choice. Suspend campaign spending now and have a chance to win or drain her bank account and lose by 15 points.\n\n+ Hillary has scored in past debates, with Obama in 2008 and Sanders this spring, by playing the victim. This strategy is unlikely to work with Trump. She needs to knock him down, if not out on his feet.\n\n+ Tonight Trump\u2019s major challenge is to prove that his hands are bigger than Hillary\u2019s.\n\n+ In pre-debate spin, Democrats denounce press for \u201cgrading Trump on a curve,\u201d once a staple of Democratic education policy. It\u2019s all standardized testing now.\n\n+ Zionist casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has just shown up to assume his role as Netanyahu\u2019s surrogate. He seemed to be stuffing money and poker chips into politicians\u2019 pockets.\n\n+ Paul Begala says that Hillary must \u201cshow us her heart tonight.\u201d No, please, no! We really don\u2019t need to see that dark, cold, merciless organ.\n\n+ What am I rooting for? The stage lighting to collapse.\n\n+ Lester Holt needs to be extremely cautious tonight. Lots of police and armed security in the debate hall. No sudden movements. Holt must keep his hands firmly on the podium at all times.\n\n+ Bill and Melania shake hands at center stage. Bill whispers something in her ear. I think it was: \u201cText me.\u201d\n\n+ Hillary enters, as the Woman in Red. The stains of Iraq, Libya, Honduras, Syria and Yemen.\n\n+ Debate opens with the economy. Hillary enumerates a laundry list of policies she doesn\u2019t believe in, while Trump goes right on the attack over the decimation of industrial economy.\n\n+ Hillary\u2019s first joke falls flat: \u201cI call it Trumped up trickle-down.\u201d No one chuckles.\n\n+ Neither of these candidates have a sense of humor, which is an ominous quality in any leader.\n\n+ Trump steamrolled Lester Holt and smoked Hillary on trade policy. Meanwhile, Hillary ludicrously blames the 2008 financial collapse on \u2026 tax policy!\n\n+ Trump says he\u2019s trying to be \u201csemi-exact\u201d in his numbers, which is closer than he\u2019s ever come before.\n\n+ Trump now looks like he\u2019s spitting blood in his assault on NAFTA and the TPP. Perhaps he ate glass for lunch or one his awful children. Hillary squirms. So does Bill.\n\n+ Feebly, Hillary actually tries to counterpunch by telling people to visit her website.\n\n+ Hillary can\u2019t stop talking about tax policy (snooze), while Trump keeps jack-hammering on jobs and Clinton/Obama trade deals.\n\n+ Crowd erupts as Trump says he will release he tax returns, when HRC releases her 30,000 deleted emails.\n\n+ Trump hits hard on $6 trillion wasted in Middle East wars by Bush-Obama-Clinton.\n\n+ Hillary hits Trump hard on stiffing his workers, but fails to mention she stiffed the ghostwriter of \u201cher\u201d book It Takes a Village.\n\n+ Trump\u2019s first joke falls flatter than Hillary\u2019s. Cite\u2019s building of Trump Intl. in DC for his business acumen. Says if he doesn\u2019t get to Penn. Ave one way, he\u2019ll get there another.\n\n+ Weak pablum from HRC on race and police. No outrage. All white paper talk.\n\n+ Trump goes the full-Mussolini on police policy. Calls for imposing stop-and-frisk in Chicago.\n\n+ Call the NRA! Trump just said the police should seize guns\u2026from blacks and Hispanics.\n\n+ Trump claims cops \u201cscared to do their job.\u201d How then to explain 854 people shot by cops this year?\n\n+ Hillary has one of her best moments denouncing the private prison system that took root after passage of Bubba\u2019s Crime Bill of 1994. Whoops.\n\n+ Trump shamelessly attacks HRC on super-predator comment. This from the man who led the witch-hunt against the kids wrongly convicted in Central Park jogger case.\n\n+ Trump flubs chance to nail Syd Blumenthal on inculcating the racist myth of Obama\u2019s birth with incoherent mumbo jumbo.\n\n+ Commercial interruption from Hillary, who took a few moments to plug her unreadable book, Stronger Together, which, at last report, had sold fewer than 2,500 copies.\n\n+ Breaking News From Trump: \u201cPalm Beach, Florida is a TOUGH community.\u201d Stop-and-frisk on the 17th green?\n\n+ Trump: \u201cWe don\u2019t know Russia hacked into the DNC. It could have been some 400-lbs guy sitting on a bed somewhere. But we do know that the emails showed how your people sabotaged Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\n+ Hillary licks her lips and begins reciting her body count in the Middle East. Vows to take Al-Baghdadi\u2019s head. Assassination politics.\n\n+ It\u2019s hard to see how HRC wins the debate over the exact date of when Trump announced his opposition to the Iraq war that she supported in Clinton time and Bush time, continued to prosecute as Sec of State and now wants to escalate as president.\n\n+ Trump doubles down on looting Middle East oil. No one mentions that this is a de facto war crime.\n\n+ Trump crumples on his opposition to NATO. Corrupting influence of the 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed his campaign.\n\n+ Bibi Netanyahu, America\u2019s real Sec. of State, frontally embraced by both Clinton and Trump.\n\n+ Trump quotes GW Bush: \u201cWe can\u2019t be policemen of the world.\u201d Rah, rah! Look how that turned out.\n\n+ Ron Jacobs emails this assessment: \u201cDonald Trump is a hog who has no problem killing the other pigs at the trough and then eating them. Hillary seemed to prove that she has at least some qualms about this particular form of gluttony.\u201d\n\n+ Five minutes after the debate, Michael Moore launched this Tweet:\u201dFellow Bernie voters \u2014 admit it, there\u2019s nothing she\u2019s said we disagree with. In fact, she\u2019s adopted his positions!\u201d Caveat: Moore confessed his sexual attraction to Hillary in his book Downsize This! Love is blind. (And, in Moore\u2019s case, deaf and dumb.)\n\n+ If this was a fight, Trump probably would have won on points as the aggressor. But he probably missed twice as many punches as he landed. Hillary was flat-footed most of the night, defending failed policies, offering little more than policy papers. As a debate it probably ends as a draw.\n\nThe night in summary, Hillary didn\u2019t knock down Donald & Donald didn\u2019t prove his hands were bigger than Hillary\u2019s. The oh-so-dangerous dangerous Jill Stein (a civil disobedience recidivist) got dragged off of campus, Lester Holt didn\u2019t get shot by the secret service and good old Gary Johnson probably had the best night of all, smoking a bowl without that crusty Bill Weld in the room to chill the mood. As for the country, it loses when either of these two becomes president."}, "https://ahtribune.com/us/2016-election/2018-parties-remain-haunted.html": {"title": "Both Main Parties Remain Haunted by 2016", "keywords": ["Democratic Party", " Republican Party", " Donald Trump", " Hillary Clinton", " Bernie Sanders", " Donna Brazile", " Steve Bannon"], "url": "https://ahtribune.com/us/2016-election/2018-parties-remain-haunted.html", "text": "The American political system and its two main parties are in the deepest legitimacy crisis in their history. There is a struggle being waged for the soul of the nation, for the very identity of America. And it has polarised opinion. Not for nothing do some refer to the situation in America today as a \u2018peaceful\u2019 civil war. Unless something changes very radically, the United States is in for a prolonged period of civil strife and political violence.\n\nWhile the GOP is threatened by a war from the extreme Right, the Left is trying to re-engineer the Democratic party into a European style social democratic party to tame the worst excesses of a Wall St corporate capitalism that leads the drive to massive inequality of income, wealth and, therefore, political power. Neither development is welcome to the respective party establishments as they remain financially and ideologically yoked to corporate interests and mentalities regardless of the financial crisis of 2008 and the failure of the Obama administration to emulate President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and forge a new political coalition that drew down the power of big banks and finance houses. The main parties are unmoored from the electorate and appear to be resistant to, or possibly, beyond reform.\n\nThe Italian communist Antonio Gramsci died long ago but his analysis of the dangers to ordinary people of political parties in decay could hardly be more apt than in today\u2019s America:\n\nIf we want to recognise the full force and meaning of Gramsci\u2019s warning, look no further than the words of US Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic party primary campaign:\n\n\u201cLet us wage a moral and political war against the billionaires and corporate leaders, on Wall Street and elsewhere, whose policies and greed are destroying the middle class of America.\u201d\n\nHe won 13 million votes, not including the caucus states he stormed through last year. When before in American history has an openly socialist candidate in national elections commanded such support? Never.\n\nA recent YouGov poll showed that the majority of millennials are defining themselves as socialist or communist \u2013 not Republicans or Democrats.\n\nIf the Republicans thought their crises in the run up to the 2016 election had been overcome by their takeover of both House and Senate in November, they were burying their heads. Democrats who thought they could blame their defeat on Putin, Wikileaks, or black and women voters, the FBI \u2013 anyone but Hillary and the DNC - remain in shock as Trump\u2019s political base remains strongly loyal. Both parties have lost their moorings, are cut off from their mass base, and appear to have no ideas of how to rebuild their credibility.\n\nIt is that stark fact that explains why Donald Trump is in the White House and is likely to serve out his entire term and probably stands a good chance of a second period as commander-in-chief.\n\nSteve Bannon, former Trump White House chief strategist, and now back on his perch at the fascistic Breitbart website, has declared war on the GOP establishment to drive it even further to the extreme right. His project seems to be to use the Trump locomotive to remake the Republican party, possibly to split it in the process, into an openly anti-immigrant and anti-minority white-nationalist nativist bloc, political preparation for a holy global race war he believes is inevitable. The Senate election contest in Alabama \u2013 with Roy Moore as the Bannon-backed candidate mired in allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards under-age girls \u2013 is one to watch for the resilience of the hard Right.\n\nThe Democrats have their own reformist \u2018insurgency\u2019 demanding the party open its doors to independent voters and radical millennials \u2013 those who backed the Sanders juggernaut for socialism, mobilising millions and raising funds from small donors only \u2013 not a single dollar from Wall St. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders who remains the most popular politician in the USA \u2013 with approval numbers at one point topping 57% - is trying to remake the Democratic party into a social democratic reform party, in a more gentlemanly war on the Democratic establishment. Unlike Bannon, Sanders is trying to save the Democratic party from oblivion and irrelevance, not destroy it, but that\u2019s not how the DNC sees his challenge. As former DNC chair Donna Brazile has shown in her memoir, backing up emails leaked by Wikileaks from John Podesta\u2019s account, the party establishment has waged covert war on Sanders\u2019s anti-Wall Street stance, and remains in thrall to the latter.\n\nBut the facts are clear: that President Obama left the Democrats in a parlous state, losing both houses of congress and over 1000 state legislative seats since 2008. This represents a cliff-style fall off of political support not equalled since the American civil war. It currently has a favourability rating at under 40% - the same as that for President Trump.\n\nAccording to an \u201cautopsy\u201d of the 2016 defeat by Sanders-inspired Democrats, the party is in danger of complete collapse unless they ride in on the coat-tails of increasingly significant social protest movements. They point to the example of Sanders adopting the Occupy Wall Street slogan \u2013 \u201cwe are the 99%\u201d \u2013 to gain electoral traction and suggest that harnessing grass-roots resistance to Trump policies to recruit volunteers, online support, small donations and election turnout. They want to harness to the party machine mass discontent and resistance.\n\nIn itself, this is a positive development \u2013 it shows that millions of Americans \u2013 and up to a third of registered Democrats - have rediscovered mass protest to stand up to racists and fascists, to protect the environment against corporate greed, oppose America\u2019s continuing militarism and wars, and to resist numerous and systematic injustices against immigrants, women and workers\u2019 rights.\n\nBut incorporating and harnessing mass protest to the Democratic machine appears to be the move of a party in deep crisis but which remains itself attached to Wall Street and all that entails as to the corporate order at home and its militarism abroad. This is most visible in Democrats\u2019 support for Trump\u2019s increased military interventions in the Middle East and Afghanistan and compromise with trillion dollar tax cuts for the richest 1% to fix an allegedly broken tax system.\n\nIt is difficult not to conclude that the Democratic party, despite hitting an electoral dead end by its embrace of Wall Street, is willing to appear once again as the voice of the people, hijack popular struggles and lead voters to the polls to place the party back into the seats of government \u2013 at which point all talk of mass protest will likely cease and politics return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d.\n\nAll this shows is that Democrats have failed to learn the lessons of 2016 \u2013 there is no returning to normalcy unless politics and government address deep-seated social inequality, loss of hope for the future among the young, and a society ravaged by market-mentalities that serve only one class of people \u2013 the super-rich. The Clintonites\u2019 response to Brazile\u2019s expose of Hillary\u2019s effective purchase of the DNC in 2016 is instructive \u2013 to smear Brazile claims as \u201cfalse Russian-fuelled propaganda\u201d.\n\nThat the Democratic party has failed to grasp the meaning of 2016 indicates that it is an unlikely vehicle for popular aspirations even in the face of the most unpopular, divisive pluto-populist president in American history. Indeed, they may well be paving the road to another Trump administration, much as Obama and Clinton cleared the path to his election in November 2016."}, "http://fox2now.com/2017/06/30/greitens-to-let-repeal-of-st-louis-minimum-become-law/": {"title": "St. Louis minimum wage to revert from $10 to $7.70", "keywords": ["news", " minimum wage", " missouri", " repeal", " st louis"], "url": "http://fox2now.com/2017/06/30/greitens-to-let-repeal-of-st-louis-minimum-become-law/", "text": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2013 Missouri Gov.

Their co-conspirators caught decade-plus prison sentences.\n\nIn March, a 57-year-old former regional boss from Vietnam Development Bank, another government-run bank, was sentenced to death over a $93-million swindling job.\n\nAccording to Vietnam\u2019s Tuoi Tre news outlet, several of his colluders were sentenced to life imprisonment after they confessed to securing bogus loans with a diamond ring and a BMW coupe. And last week, in an unrelated case, charges against senior employees from the same bank allege $47 million in losses from dubious loans.\n\nNone of this would impress Bernie Madoff, mastermind of America\u2019s largest ever financial fraud scheme. The combined amount from all three Vietnamese cases adds up to less than 1 percent of his purported $18-billion haul.\n\nBut these death sentences nevertheless are high profile scandals in Vietnam.\n\nThat\u2019s the point. Human rights watchdogs contend that splashy trials in Vietnam are acts of political theater with predetermined conclusions. The audience: a Vietnamese public weary of state corruption. But these sentences also sound loud alarm bells to dodgy bankers who are currently running scams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a message to those in this game to be less greedy and that business as usual is getting out of hand,\u201d said Adam McCarty, chief economist with the Hanoi-based consulting firm Mekong Economics.\n\n\u201cThe message to people in the system is this: Your chances of getting caught are increasing,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cDon\u2019t just rely on big people above you. Because some of these [perpetrators] would\u2019ve had big people above them. And it didn\u2019t help them.\u201d\n\nLike most nations that crush dissent and operate with little transparency, Vietnam is highly corrupt.\n\nAccording to a World Bank study, half of all businesses operating within the communist state expect that gift giving toward officials is required \u201cto get things done.\u201d Transparency International, which publishes the world\u2019s leading corruption gauge, contends Vietnam is more corrupt than Mexico but not quite as bad as Russia.\n\nUnlike in America, where judges can\u2019t sentence white-collar criminals to death, Vietnam can execute its citizens for a range of corporate crimes.\n\nAmnesty International reports that death sentences in Vietnam have been handed down to criminals for running shady investment schemes, counterfeiting cash and even defaulting on loans. This is unusual: United Nations officials have condemned death for \u201ceconomic crimes\u201d yet Vietnam persists with these sentences \u2014 as does neighboring China.\n\nThough statistics on Vietnam\u2019s opaque justice system are scarce, a state official conceded that more than 675 people sit on death row for a range of crimes, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the bankers will be killed. Vietnam\u2019s traditional means of execution involves binding perpetrators to a wooden post, stuffing their mouths with lemons and calling in a firing squad. The nation wants to transition to lethal injections. But European nations refuse to export chemicals used in executions (namely sodium thiopental) to governments practicing capital punishment.\n\nFraudulent bankers are receiving heavy sentences at a moment when Vietnam is enacting major financial reforms.\n\nFor decades, Vietnam has been slowly transforming its communist-style, state-run market into a more open and competitive arena. In the post-reunification era, the government owned every bank in Vietnam. Today, state-run banks control only 40 percent of all assets.\n\nThis push to bank in a more Western style has ushered in improvements as well as temptations to swindle. According to the UN economist Vu Quang Viet, Vietnamese credit laws passed in 2010 \u201csimply copied the lax US law now widely believed to be at least partially responsible for the financial debacle in 2008.\u201d\n\nCampaigns to root out corruption are promoted as a way to entice foreign investment, which could help prop up Vietnamese banks whose growth has slowed from a sprint to a jog.\n\nBut the recent death sentences aren\u2019t really intended to prove the reformers\u2019 sincerity to the outside world, according to McCarty.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about foreigners. It\u2019s all internal politics,\u201d McCarty said. Foreign banking honchos wouldn\u2019t be impressed by a few executions anyway. \u201cIf you really want to want to resolve the problem, you can\u2019t just arrest people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to improve accountability and transparency in the entire system.\u201d\n\nA leading Vietnamese newspaper, Thanh Nien, is also pushing for system-wide cleanup in lieu of showcase trials against a few corporate criminals.\n\nAn op-ed in the paper recently compared death sentences for corruption to fighting fire with fire. The preferred approach would be dousing corruption before it burns through public funds. \u201cIt is better to prevent corruption,\u201d the paper opined, \u201cthan deal with it after the fact.\u201d"}, "https://gfycat.com/ContentCourageousBarasinga": {"title": "Venezuela marching in support of Maduro - Create, Discover and Share GIFs on", "keywords": ["gif", " animated", " image host", " gif maker", " 10mb", " video", " mp4", " webm"], "url": "https://gfycat.com/ContentCourageousBarasinga", "text": ""}, "http://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/neo-nazi-fears-stabbing-of-black-man-may-lead-to-unfair-discrimination-against-white-supremacists/": {"title": "Neo-Nazi fears stabbing of black man may lead to 'unfair' discrimination against white supremacists", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/neo-nazi-fears-stabbing-of-black-man-may-lead-to-unfair-discrimination-against-white-supremacists/", "text": "Andrew Anglin wearing a 'Make America Great Again' hat to show his political support for Donald Trump -- via Wiki commons\n\nWhite supremacist Andrew Anglin, founder of the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, condemned the racially-motivated murder of a black man in New York City, arguing it \u201cdoes not represent White Supremacy\u201d and warning the attack could lead to unfair discrimination against white supremacists.\n\nMonday, James Jackson\u2014a white Army veteran from Baltimore who authorities say visited New York City with the intent to stalk and kill black men\u2014fatally stabbed Timothy Caughman (pictured below), a bottle collector who lived in transitional housing.

He had previously amassed money by buying and selling real estate, but had no ongoing job. He lacked the relationships that flow from working with others to accomplish a shared goal where each person has a part to play. The stability of a daily job and the people to whom that job connects you are bulwarks against loneliness and mental instability.\n\nStephen Paddock\u2019s last family contact was with one of his brothers whom he telephoned three years before the shooting. He had not contacted other family members for 20 years. He and his live-in girlfriend kept their blinds closed. They socialized with no one.\n\nPaddock had been told throughout his life that the U.S. was a special place, an exceptional place. Each generation, if its members studied and worked hard, would live better than the one before. Progress and prosperity awaited him. He would raise a family and provide his wife and children with more than had been provided to him and to his family of origin. Both of his marriages soon ended in divorce.\n\nAs millions of secure jobs disappeared, especially after the 1970s, Paddock became unemployed often for long periods. He became a real estate dealer buying and selling buildings for profit. He amassed some wealth, an American dream most men do not achieve, but it did not connect him to other human beings. Paddock had failed to achieve the promised dream of the connections and family that money was supposed to accompany. He lost his moorings.\n\nEven when he managed an activity that brought him money, it tended to be in areas not associated with hard work in connection with others. From making money speculating in real estate he moved on to solitary gambling at casinos. He had no place in the socially approved work and life images he had grown up to value, expect and seek as markers of his success as a human being.\n\nMental health can be likened to a table resting on four legs. One leg is an intimate relationship with a partner, friend or relative to whom one can intimately connect when the need arises. A second leg is a wider circle of people with whom one shares friendly connections. They may be work colleagues or a circle of casual friends or relatives whose company you enjoy. It may even be close Facebook friends, but you see them less frequently than your intimate connection(s). A third leg is a group to which you connect in a limited but shared activity. That may be a team sport, a volunteer effort, a PTA, or political organization whose members develop the solidarity of working together. A fourth leg is connection to one\u2019s nation and the world through political activity, engagement with media covering major current events, and sharing opinions, ideas or petitions online. A table can be sturdy and stable with at least three strong legs, but only two or one does not suffice.\n\nAmericans have become frighteningly disconnected and alone. There are fewer Americans active in any group than there were in bowling leagues alone in 1970. The many millions of loners accumulating in the U.S. since the \u201970s tend to experience and define their disconnection as personal. Many think it is their fault that they cannot occupy a happy place of connection in the America they imagine is still there. They imagine that other people continue to find ways to connect. They feel adrift. They can come to resent those from whom they are slipping away.\n\nAmerican white men once received two wage supplements in what was a sexist and racist labor market. One wage supplement was for whiteness and the other for maleness. With the resulting \u201cfamily wage\u201d generally paid to white men, they could support a woman working full time at home, providing full maid service, sexual labor, child care, and the emotional labor of making social connections to engage the whole family with friends and relatives. With white men\u2019s family wage now largely gone, most women are now employed outside the home. They cannot, in addition, do all the housework, childcare, etc., that they did before. They want their men to share emotional and domestic burdens in the home. Yet many men want extra services at home to compensate them for their lower pay and lower status outside the home. Household tensions rise. Women are abandoning those men who cannot support them yet still demand a range of household services that employed women cannot and do not want to perform. American white men have been disempowered. They are hurting.\n\nThe family wage for white men evaporated as modern jet travel and telecommunications enabled U.S. capitalists to relocate production overseas where wages are much lower. Simultaneously, computers enabled an intensification of automation. Capitalists stopped worrying about living, no less family, wages, safety standards, benefits, or ecological safety measures. Where once capitalist profit-seeking produced a family wage, post-1970s profit-seeking took it away.\n\nGender plays its own role in white men\u2019s pain and their coping mechanisms. Men\u2019s emotions are constrained. They have to \u201cman up\u201d even in the face of devastating, real losses. Sex remains a key need allowed both for and within a widespread male stereotype. Likewise, anger remains an emotion permitted and often celebrated as manly and powerful.\n\nMany men look to recoup their lost powers. They become especially vulnerable to advertisements for products promoted as conveying power. Nothing illustrates this better than some ads for Bushmaster automatic weapons. They ask, \u201cDoes your wife or girlfriend make more money than you? Revoke your man card. Do you prefer tofu to meat? Revoke your man card.\u201d After such questions, the Bushmaster automatic rifle is celebrated with the statement \u201cReinstate your man card.\u201d That ad was pulled after many protested and after the Bushmaster was used by Adam Lanza in the Sandy Hook mass shooting that killed 20 elementary school children and six staff members.\n\nIn stark gender contrast, women often find primary feminine identity in close friendships with other women or in connection to relatives and children. Their identity allows a wide range of vulnerable needs and emotions. Women are far less frequent gun users. Women also do not appear on the roster of mass shootings.\n\nOften, disempowered people\u2014particularly white men\u2014are tempted to search for and find scapegoats to blame for their disenfranchisement and loneliness. Cues from political leaders seeking votes can point them to certain social groups. For example, Trump and many Republicans make none too subtle negative comments about immigrants, women, minorities and a government they denounce for privileging those groups at the expense of white Americans, etc.\n\nThe liberal U.S. media often blame angry, disempowered white men and their spokespersons for being politically incorrect and boorish. Those media rarely if ever analyze the role of capitalism in denying white men their family wages and the American dream. Capitalism\u2014the profit system\u2014is thereby rendered innocent while angry white workers are deplorably prejudiced. Men versus women, white against non-white, immigrant against native: a divided mass of people (mostly employees) get caught up in conflicts as while capitalists accumulate wealth and capitalism evades criticism.\n\nAmericans do not have a mass party or organized voice to help people understand that capitalist profiteering motivated those who took their family wages and jobs. Many are thus left with hatred for other people. That seldom works to overcome or end loneliness.\n\nAmericans have found still other ways to cope with their loneliness and disconnection: they medicate themselves against personal pain with alcohol and painkilling drugs. Self-medicating is a now an epidemic. Fully 64,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2016. In this drug refuge, capitalist profit also shows its hand. Most U.S. drug deaths are caused either by opiates (natural substances like heroin) or opioids (synthetic painkillers like Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet and Fentanyl). Doctors are paid well to keep prescribing by the supremely profitable pharmaceutical industry. Alcohol is legal and also affords a personal escape from the misery of losing family wages. An estimated 88,000 people (approximately 62,000 men and 26,000 women) die from alcohol-related causes annually. Food is also a comfort for loneliness. One in three American adults and at least one in ten U.S. children are obese. Loneliness is an epidemic in America.\n\nWork is a central activity for most adults. The more speedup is installed by employers, the more employees are prevented from connecting at work. The less people are employed together, the lonelier they are. As the gig economy and part-time and temp work situations multiply, so does loneliness. Most men\u2019s only emotionally close relationships are tied to their work or sex partnerships. With work relationships ever more fragile and temporary, much the same happens to sexual connections. Meanwhile, marriages are being undermined by that same erosion of the family wage. For the first time in U.S. history, a majority of people 35 and under are now unattached.\n\nOne out of four Americans has no one to talk to even in the worst emergencies. Most of those people are men. For deeply disconnected and resentful men, social norms can fade; angry shooting at random others becomes possible. This is an especially American phenomenon. In 2017 so far, we have had 152 mass shootings. No other developed nation has had anything remotely like that. Why? One reason is that all other developed nations have gun controls and none have an unchecked gun industry that relentlessly equates guns with manhood. Another reason is that other developed nations have powerful unions and political movements that direct people\u2019s anger about the pain in their lives toward its social causes and especially the inequality and instability of capitalist systems. They connect people to change those social and economic conditions together.\n\nFor 150 years from 1820 to 1970, every generation of families led by white men did better economically than the generation before them. Even in the Great Depression of the 1930s prices fell faster than wages; employed men even then earned more than their predecessors. That historical process of improvement stopped in the 1970s. The belief in American exceptionalism did not stop with the changed reality. That left American white men with self-blame for their economic difficulties and the resulting psychic pains. Worse still, it left them with the idea that they could individually overcome their intolerable situations.\n\nWhat we need in order to stop the carnage of mass shootings is a social movement that articulates a social analysis of America\u2019s problems and is unafraid to put the capitalist system at the core of those problems. We also need a social movement committed to social changes that include going beyond the capitalist system. If people could join together, face that their lives are plundered in order for capitalists to increase profit, and face that gender stereotypes distort our shared humanity, then together we can change the conditions of despair, rage, and loneliness that generate mass shootings."}, "http://www.marxist.com/youth-protests-across-france-neither-the-banker-nor-the-racist.htm": {"title": "Youth protests across France: \u201cNeither the banker, nor the racist!\u201d", "keywords": ["Marxism", " Revolution", " 1917", " Marx", " Lenin", " Trotsky"], "url": "http://www.marxist.com/youth-protests-across-france-neither-the-banker-nor-the-racist.htm", "text": "Since Thursday, students and youth in Paris, Rennes, Nantes, Toulouse and other cities across France have held rallies and marched through the city streets. The protests were against the right wing nationalist Marine Le Pen and the liberal Emmanuel Macron who are facing off in the in the second round of the presidential election.\n\nIn total, more than 3,000 high school students took to the streets carrying signs exclaiming: \u201cNeither the banker, nor the racist!\u201d and \u201cThe real anti-establishment, that is us!\u201d Political slogans could be heard through the streets as students chanted \u201cIt is not the immigrants who should be expelled, it is Marine Le Pen!\u201d, \"Macron, Le Pen, we do not want them!\u201d, \u201cTheir elections, our future!\"\n\nDuring many of the protests, the youth were met by armoured police blocking the marches and dispersing tear gas canisters into the crowds, while surveillance helicopters could be seen in the sky above. One police officer in Rennes even resorted to drawing his pistol and for a brief moment aiming it at the protesters.\n\nIn Paris, gathering at Place de la Republique the protest moved towards Boulevard Beaumarchais, where the tension rose between police and students. Anouk, a 16 year-old Parisian student from Lyc\u00e9e Buffon explains how the protests were organised as a peaceful sit-in by high school students from all over Paris. She said: \"We disagree with the values put forward by the National Front, and since we do not have the right to vote, we have to express ourselves differently\u201d.\n\nIn Lyons the protests escalated as well. Students hung banners on the gates of the town hall, where one read: \"By my acts I vote 365 days a year. You who come out only 2 Sundays every 5 years, just vote as you see fit.\u201d At the end of the rally, demonstrators left the Place des Terreaux shouting \u201cdown with capitalism\u201d. A group of youths then wanted to cross one of the city-bridges to join the protest on the other side of the river, but were arrested by the police who fired tear gas at them.\n\nThe protests across France come after years of political frustration among youths and workers. Current president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the French Socialist Party have, despite their promises, implemented countless austerity policies and allowed companies to cut workers' salaries. Meanwhile, youth unemployment still stands at 24.6%. For this, Hollande and the Socialist Party have paid the price, with the party in a deep crisis and their candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon, securing only 6.4% of the votes in Sunday\u2019s first round election. As the last part of the presidential race now pits a racist right-winger against an ex-banker, the frustration among those who face tough conditions continues to increase.\n\nWith left-wing candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon out of the presidential race, the workers and youth of France only have more capitalist policies of austerity and attacks on living conditions to look forward to. The crisis of French capitalism has, like in many other European countries, expressed itself through a massive political polarisation to the left and to the right. The traditional parties of the establishment, which the ruling class have relied upon for decades, are all in deep crises of legitimacy. The rise of Le Pen to the right and Melenchon to the left is an indication of this process. But the recent protests indicate that a layer amongst the youth are drawing even more radical conclusions. Many of these young people see the crises facing society not only as a result of poor political decision-making, but as a result of the capitalist system. They see no future within the confines of this system and correctly distrust all representatives of the ruling class.\n\nProtests like the ones across France this week show just how fed up many students and workers are with austerity, lies upon lies from politicians and the capitalist system in general. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s massive success, where 30% of voters aged 18 to 24 voted in favor of his movement, is a sign of the potential for radical movements in the next period. The youth who took to the streets this week are reflecting the brewing mood under the surface, and anticipating future developments within the wider youth and the working class. There are undoubtedly more protests on the way and for the workers and youth of France it will only become clearer that the problems facing France, Europe and the entire world cannot be solved within the limits of capitalism. The only solution, as many young people are realising, is \u201cNeither the banker, nor the racist!\u201d but to break with the capitalist system and expropriate the means of production to create a truly fair society."}, "https://boingboing.net/2017/10/22/there-is-an-alternative.html": {"title": "Jeremy Corbyn to European left-wing parties: you won't win until you abandon neoliberalism", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://boingboing.net/2017/10/22/there-is-an-alternative.html", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn to European left-wing parties: you won't win until you abandon neoliberalism\n\nThe Europe Together conference in Brussels brought together party leadership from \"centre-left\" parties across Europe; Jeremy Corbyn got two standing ovations for a barn-burning speech in which he called on European left wing parties to abandon Blairite anti-union/pro-bank policies and embrace policies that helped working families and reduced inequality.\n\nCorbyn railed against low taxes for the rich, deregulation and privatisation of public industries and decried a false centrism that he blamed for the rise of reactionary, xenophobic far-right movements across Europe.\n\nCorbyn's warm reception started during his introduction, where he was described as \"the new Prime Minister of Britain.\"\n\n\u201cWe all know their politics of hate, blame and division and not the answer, but unless we offer a clear and radical alternative of credible solutions for the problem we face, unless we offer a chance to change the broken system, and hope for a more prosperous future, we are clearing the path for the extreme right to make even more far-reaching inroads into our communities.

Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.\n\nEssentially, machine owners will become the bourgeoisie of a new era, in which the corporations they own won\u2019t provide jobs to actual human workers.\n\nAs it is, the chasm between the super rich and the rest is growing. For starters, capital \u2015 such as stocks or property \u2015 accrues value at a much faster rate than the actual economy grows, according to the French economist Thomas Piketty. The wealth of the rich multiplies faster than wages increase, and the working class can never even catch up.\n\nBut if Hawking is right, the problem won\u2019t be about catching up.

Once they reached City Hall, the silence gave way to chants for justice.\n\nThe city has been marked by protests since Friday, when former police officer Jason Stockley was acquitted on charges of murdering a black motorist after a police chase in 2011. Stockley is white.\n\nOvernight Sunday, police arrested more than 80 people after a peaceful protest turned violent as night fell. In a concentrated area downtown, some protesters smashed windows and overturned trash cans, while others threw chemicals and rocks at police, authorities said.\n\n\u201cAfter the demonstration, organizers announced that the daytime protest was over,\u201d Mayor Lyda Krewson said in news conference at about 1 a.m. Monday. \u201cBut a group of agitators stayed behind, apparently intent on breaking windows and destroying property.\u201d\n\nShe declined to take reporters\u2019 questions.\n\nSome protesters complained that police were unnecessarily aggressive. Further inflaming tensions, a St. Louis photographer reported he and others heard police chant \u201cwhose streets, our streets\u201d after making some arrests.\n\nThe photojournalist, David Carson, later tweeted that he\u2019d spoken to the commander at the scene, who said that he did not hear the chant but that it was unacceptable and he would \u201cdeal with it.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press also independently reported on the police chanting. The phrase used is commonly chanted by demonstrators, particularly Black Lives Matters protesters.\n\nAt around 11:20 p.m. Sunday, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s Twitter feed said \u201cmultiple warnings to disperse\u201d had been given near the intersection of Washington Avenue and North Tucker Boulevard. They soon started arresting those that hadn\u2019t left.\n\nBut several protesters said police had encircled them and there was no way out. Caught in the melee was St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Mike Faulk, who tweeted, \u201cLess than 100 of us including media blocked in at wa and Tucker on all four sides.\u201d\n\nShortly afterward, Faulk was among those arrested. In a photo, he appeared to be wearing a media badge around his neck at the time of his arrest.\n\nInterim Police Chief Lawrence O\u2019Toole repeatedly referred to those arrested as \u201ccriminals\u201d during a news conference overnight Sunday.\n\n\u201cThese criminals that we\u2019ve arrested should be held accountable and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in control. This is our city and we\u2019re going to protect it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Toole said some officers incurred \u201cmoderate or minor\u201d injuries, but didn\u2019t say how many were hurt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to tell you the city of St. Louis is safe and the police owned tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce again, a group of criminals set out to break windows and destroy property. Tonight, those criminals are in jail.\u201d\n\nAccording to local media, about 1,000 people had gathered outside a downtown police station before sunset and marched peacefully before nightfall. The violence appeared to erupt about 8 p.m. as a small group broke away and began smashing windows at several businesses.\n\nThose protesters were eventually greeted by police officers dressed in riot gear. Police said they gave demonstrators an hour\u2019s notice before making the mass arrests just before midnight.\n\nEarlier Sunday, news outlets reported that the Department of Justice had opted not to pursue a federal civil rights prosecution of former officer Stockley. The decision was made a year ago, but the department waited to announce it until after Friday\u2019s verdict in the criminal case.\n\nStockley, 36, was charged in May 2016 with first degree murder in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith after a police chase. Stockley and his partner had pursued Smith by vehicle after failing in an attempt to arrest him for a suspected drug deal at a Church\u2019s Chicken.\n\nProsecutors said in a videotape during the chase, Stockley was heard saying \u201cGoing to kill this motherf\u2014er don\u2019t you know it\u201d before telling his partner to drive into Smith\u2019s slowing car. Prosecutors also suggested Stockley had planted a gun in the vehicle since the weapon contained the officer\u2019s DNA, but not Smith\u2019s.\n\nIn a 30-page ruling issued Friday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson said he had agonized over his decision. \u201cThis Court, as the trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d he said.\n\nProtests erupted almost immediately on the streets of St. Louis.\n\nActress Amber Tamblyn: The sexism in Hollywood \u2018is frightening,\u2019 as evidenced by James Woods\n\nTrump lawyers spill beans after terrible choice of restaurant \u2014 next door to the New York Times"}, "http://news.groopspeak.com/hillarys-state-department-pressured-haiti-not-to-raise-minimum-wage-to-61-an-hour/": {"title": "Hillary\u2019s State Department Pressured Haiti Not To Raise Minimum Wage to $.61 An Hour", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://news.groopspeak.com/hillarys-state-department-pressured-haiti-not-to-raise-minimum-wage-to-61-an-hour/", "text": "In Haiti, people work for peanuts. Slave wages. Less than $5 per day, but they supply the U.S. with tons of affordable clothing from big-name brands like Levi\u2019s, Hanes and Polo. Haiti\u2019s big advantage, compared to Asia, is their proximity to us, and thousands of Haitians are employed in the textile industry in part because of that. When Haiti passed a wage raise from $.24 per hour to $.61 per hour, American companies were predictably outraged.\n\nU.S. companies, especially the clothing manufacturers, outsource their manufacturing to places like Haiti specifically because they can get away with paying slave wages. They would only support a minimum wage increase to $.31 per hour, and decided to get the U.S. Department of State involved to try and pressure Haiti\u2019s government to keep the wage raise down.\n\nThis took place in 2011, and Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State. Our corporations were successful, and Haitians continued to work for worse slave wages than they otherwise would have, all so U.S. corporations could take home higher profits.\n\nAt the time, the U.S. Embassy said that the wage increase didn\u2019t take economic realities into account, and that it was a move designed specifically to appeal to the unemployed and underpaid masses of Haiti. Imagine that. Imagine trying to help your people have a better life instead of catering to huge corporations at your people\u2019s expense. The horror.\n\nHere\u2019s how much it would cost Hanes to give its Haitian workers a $2 per day raise ($2 per day is roughly what the wage increase would be):\n\nThey just simply cannot deal without that $1.6 million, to the point that they managed to get our government involved in the affairs of another government. It didn\u2019t matter that Haitian families actually need $12.50 per day to make ends meet.\n\nIn 2012, everyone from Clinton herself, to celebrities like Ben Stiller and Sean Penn, gathered at the opening of a new industrial park in Haiti. In 2015, Hillary said this about it:\n\nShe promised jobs, but when people hear a promise of jobs, they generally assume those jobs will allow them to support themselves. The jobs we\u2019ve created in Haiti do nothing of the sort. Some Haitians feel they can\u2019t complain because any job is better than no job, but on the other hand, those same Haitians wish they were paid more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time our government\u2019s gotten involved with another government over corporate interests. We\u2019re beholden to our rich corporations. We apparently owe it to them to make sure other governments don\u2019t eat into their profits by passing laws that protect workers, or do anything else that threaten profits. In 1953, we helped the U.K. overthrow Iran\u2019s democratically-elected president over his nationalization of what would later become British Petroleum, or BP.\n\nUnder the guise of stopping communism, we worked with the U.K. to try and install a pro-western government (meaning, a government sympathetic to our business interests there). Iran points to this coup as the reason for their deep distrust of us, and really, who can blame them for that?\n\nIn 1954, we overthrew Guatemala\u2019s democratically-elected president, again, under the guise of protecting the world, and our interests, from communism.\n\nWhat was our real problem there? We were worried that their new president would turn land over to poorer members of its society and create a middle class. Oh, the sheer horror. Ordinarily we probably would have kept our noses out of that, however, the land in question was land that belonged to the United Fruit Company, a U.S.-based agriculture corporation. President Arbenz would have compensated them for their losses, but they weren\u2019t having any of that. We got the idea that Arbenz was a secret communist from the United Fruit Company.\n\nFor the pursuit of American profit, Guatemala sat under the rule of military dictators for the next 30 years. They are just now emerging from all the shadows of that time.\n\nWhat happened in Haiti isn\u2019t as egregious, but it is just as insidious in its own way \u2013 the U.S. government interfered with a foreign, sovereign government for the benefit of rich American corporations. This particular instance happened under a Secretary of State who promised jobs, but probably didn\u2019t let on that those jobs would pay next to zilch. Investing is good. It\u2019s better than aid, but we\u2019re half-assing it there, all in the name of profit.\n\nImage by Marc Nozell.

Around 1 pm on Thursday, several individuals met in downtown Houston to distribute plates of hot food, blankets, and other supplies to the city\u2019s growing homeless population. Soon after, Houston police arrived on the scene of two different intersections where the homeless advocates were giving out gifts and food.\n\nAccording to witness testimony posted on Facebook, the police instructed the homeless to throw away everything they had been given. \u201cNot only were the police called, but they brought a large waste management truck and are forcing the homeless to throw away their food, pillows and other items,\u201d reads one post.\n\nA video from an ABC13 social media correspondent shows the police and trash vehicle parked under a freeway while a man narrates the situation. \u201cCovers, Blankets, different things like that, pillows. They are throwing all of that away,\u201d he says.\n\nShere Dore, a local activist who works with several organizations, including Food Not Bombs Houston, was involved in the food sharing and says the throwing away of the gifts was uncalled for. \u201cI\u2019m highly disturbed because lots of these items were not only given to the homeless by the community, but some of the blankets and jackets were literally purchased by homeless advocates like myself,\u201d Dore told Anti-Media. \u201cHPD and the City of Houston are taking our cash and throwing it in the trash. At what point will our police stand up and say that this is wrong to do to people?\u201c\n\nOnly moments before throwing away the gifts, the Houston police stopped Dore and a fellow advocate. Dore said her friend was taking photos of the police vehicle when the officer began questioning them, claiming someone had called and complained about people feeding the homeless. In a video posted on Facebook, Dore tells the officer she will feed the homeless whether it is legal or not.\n\nThese types of situations are likely to increase in Houston due to a 2012 city ordinance prohibiting the sharing of food with more than five people at a time without fulfilling certain requirements created by city council. The controversial measure, known as the \u201cAnti-Food Sharing\u201d ordinance by critics, was passed in 2012 despite resistance from one of the largest coalitions of political, activist, and religious organizations in Houston. The criticisms of the ordinance range from beliefs that it represents an attack on the homeless population to assertions it is another example of government restricting freedom.\n\nThe ordinance requires applicants to fill out a form and seek permission to feed someone while on someone else\u2019s private property. If you would like to feed someone in a public park you must fill out another form. The city argues that feeding the homeless food that has not been cooked in a certified kitchen could spread illness and that feeding them is only enabling homelessness. Although Houston police have yet to issue a citation for violation of the ordinance, it has been an issue of concern among activists since the moment it passed. In late November, ABC13 reported that activists delivered 75,000 signed petitions to City Hall calling for the repeal of the ordinance.\n\nAs Houston prepares to host the National Football League\u2019s Super Bowl 51, there is concern that the homeless population will be forced out of the downtown area or subject to increased harassment from the police. In November AP reported, \u201cfences have gone up and dozens homeless people living under a Houston freeway overpass have been ordered out amid speculation the city is trying to make the area more presentable as it prepares to host the Super Bowl early next year.\u201d The Texas Transportation Department claims the move was not related to the Super Bowl and insists they were responding to safety concerns for drivers and pedestrians.\n\nIf the City of Houston is attempting to remove the homeless for their incoming sports event/ economic boom, it would not be the first. In April 2016 the International Business Times reported on the Brazilian government\u2019s attempts to beautify parts of Rio at the expense of the homeless and other at-risk groups.\n\n\u201c\u2018Cleaning the streets,\u2019 as the project is euphemistically known, is not an effort to haul garbage but to sweep away homeless people and drug dealers \u2014 including the often drug-addicted children who live on the sidewalks of some of Rio\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods.\n\nAdvocates for homeless youth say children are being detained arbitrarily by police \u2014 or in some cases simply vanishing. They warn that the \u201ccleanup\u201d is likely to make life worse than ever for the thousands of children who have already been forced out of their homes by abuse or desperate poverty.\u201d\n\nRio and Houston are not alone in their mistreatment of homeless individuals. In October 2014, the National Coalition for the Homeless released a report that found 21 U.S. cities have passed measures restricting feeding of the homeless since January 2013.\n\nAs we enter the \u201choliday season,\u201d take a few moments to reflect on whatever abundance you have in your life and think of those who have less. If the police, city officials, and sports-obsessed public have their way, those without a home (by choice or circumstance) will be harassed, pushed out, and eventually rounded up. Let\u2019s each do what we can to prevent this nightmare from becoming reality.\n\nThis article (Unhappy Holidays: Houston Police Force Homeless People to Throw Away Food) is free and open source.

It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.\n\nThe authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.\n\n\"It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,\" co-author Stanton Glantz told The New York Times.\n\nIn the article, published Monday, authors Glantz, Cristin Kearns and Laura Schmidt aren't trying make the case for a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. Their interest is in the process. They say the documents reveal the sugar industry attempting to influence scientific inquiry and debate.\n\nThe researchers note that they worked under some limitations \u2014 \"We could not interview key actors involved in this historical episode because they have died,\" they write. Other organizations were also advocating concerns about fat, they note.\n\nThere's no evidence that the SRF directly edited the manuscript published by the Harvard scientists in 1967, but there is \"circumstantial\" evidence that the interests of the sugar lobby shaped the conclusions of the review, the researchers say.\n\nFor one thing, there's motivation and intent. In 1954, the researchers note, the president of the SRF gave a speech describing a great business opportunity.\n\nIf Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower-fat diet \u2014 for the sake of their health \u2014 they would need to replace that fat with something else. America's per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third.\n\nBut in the '60s, the SRF became aware of \"flowing reports that sugar is a less desirable dietary source of calories than other carbohydrates,\" as John Hickson, SRF vice president and director of research, put it in one document.\n\nHe recommended that the industry fund its own studies \u2014 \"Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors.\"\n\nThe next year, after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease, the SRF approved the literature-review project. It wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today's dollars for the research.\n\nOne of the researchers was the chairman of Harvard's Public Health Nutrition Department \u2014 and an ad hoc member of SRF's board.\n\n\"A different standard\" for different studies\n\nGlantz, Kearns and Schmidt say many of the articles examined in the review were hand-selected by SRF, and it was implied that the sugar industry would expect them to be critiqued.\n\nIn a letter, SRF's Hickson said that the organization's \"particular interest\" was in evaluating studies focused on \"carbohydrates in the form of sucrose.\"\n\n\"We are well aware,\" one of the scientists replied, \"and will cover this as well as we can.\"\n\nThe project wound up taking longer than expected, because more and more studies were being released that suggested sugar might be linked to coronary heart disease. But it was finally published in 1967.\n\nHickson was certainly happy with the result: \"Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print,\" he told one of the scientists.\n\nThe review minimized the significance of research that suggested sugar could play a role in coronary heart disease. In some cases the scientists alleged investigator incompetence or flawed methodology.\n\n\"It is always appropriate to question the validity of individual studies,\" Kearns told Bloomberg via email. But, she says, \"the authors applied a different standard\" to different studies \u2014 looking very critically at research that implicated sugar, and ignoring problems with studies that found dangers in fat.\n\nEpidemiological studies of sugar consumption \u2014 which look at patterns of health and disease in the real world \u2014 were dismissed for having too many possible factors getting in the way. Experimental studies were dismissed for being too dissimilar to real life.\n\nOne study that found a health benefit when people ate less sugar and more vegetables was dismissed because that dietary change was not feasible.\n\nAnother study, in which rats were given a diet low in fat and high in sugar, was rejected because \"such diets are rarely consumed by man.\"\n\nThe Harvard researchers then turned to studies that examined risks of fat \u2014 which included the same kind of epidemiological studies they had dismissed when it came to sugar.\n\nCiting \"few study characteristics and no quantitative results,\" as Kearns, Glantz and Schmidt put it, they concluded that cutting out fat was \"no doubt\" the best dietary intervention to prevent coronary heart disease.\n\nSugar lobby: \"Transparency standards were not the norm\"\n\nIn a statement, the Sugar Association \u2014 which evolved out of the SRF \u2014 said it is challenging to comment on events from so long ago.\n\n\"We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today,\" the association said.\n\n\"Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted,\" the statement continues. \"What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues.\"\n\nThe documents in question are five decades old, but the larger issue is of the moment, as Marion Nestle notes in a commentary in the same issue of JAMA Internal Medicine:\n\nAs for the article authors who dug into the documents around this funding, they offer two suggestions for the future.\n\n\"Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies,\" they write.\n\nThey also call for new research into any ties between added sugars and coronary heart disease."}, "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/03/09/the-poor-just-dont-want-health-care-republican-congressman-faces-backlash-over-comments/?utm_term=.0407812c9cc6": {"title": "The poor \u2018just don\u2019t want health care\u2019: Republican congressman faces backlash over comments", "keywords": ["Obamacare", " health care", " Rep.

Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), a member of the GOP Doctors Caucus, said comments he made to STAT were not meant to suggest that poor people take health care for granted. The comments were published in a story last week about his burgeoning role in the fight to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cJust like Jesus said, \u2018The poor will always be with us,\u2019 \u201d Marshall said in response to a question about Medicaid, which expanded under Obamacare to more than 30 states. \u201cThere is a group of people that just don\u2019t want health care and aren\u2019t going to take care of themselves.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cmorally, spiritually, socially,\u201d the poor, including the homeless, \u201cjust don\u2019t want health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And I\u2019m not judging; I\u2019m just saying socially that\u2019s where they are,\u201d he told STAT, a website focused on health-care coverage. \u201cSo there\u2019s a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought [to] the ER.\u201d\n\nThe comments immediately drew criticism from Medicaid advocates in Kansas, with some saying that Marshall mischaracterized and misunderstood people who are in the program.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are out there, working hard, paying their bills, and to have their elected member of Congress pointing their finger at them I\u2019m sure is disappointing,\u201d David Jordan, executive director of the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, told the Kansas City Star.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Marshall, who was elected in November, said he was trying to explain that a national health-care policy around \u201cone segment of the population\u201d does not work because groups of people have varying medical needs and use different health-care resources.\n\n\u201cI was also saying that Obamacare has increased premiums on working, middle-class families by almost 200 percent in some places, and with deductibles of over $10,000, many don\u2019t actually have access to health care,\u201d Marshall said in a statement. \u201cCoverage means nothing if you can\u2019t afford access.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen I said, \u2018the poor will always be with us,\u2019 it was actually in the context of supporting the obligation we have to always take care of people, but we cannot completely craft a larger, affordable health-care policy around a comparatively small segment of the population who will get care no matter what.\u201d\n\nHe also brought up his years in the medical field. Before he was elected, Marshall was an OB/GYN in Great Bend, Kan., helping to deliver more than 5,000 babies throughout his career, according to a brief biography.\n\n[The debate over the Affordable Care Act is really a debate over wealth redistribution]\n\n\u201cMany patients drove over a hundred miles to see us as I was the only OB clinic to accept Medicaid, and others who could not afford prenatal care. My career gives testimony to my personal watchfulness to those who need help, and to allude otherwise is simply not judicious,\u201d Marshall said in his statement. \u201cI am a physician, not a politician. While I don\u2019t perfectly rehearse talking points, my agenda is driven [by] my two realities: That Obamacare has been detrimental to patients and that we must care for all in need, no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe political newcomer unseated former representative Tim Huelskamp to represent the 1st Congressional District of Kansas. He\u2019s a new member of the GOP Doctors Caucus, co-chaired by Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), one of the leading conservative voices in the health-care debate. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who was confirmed last month, is a former member of the caucus.\n\nMarshall is not the only House member who\u2019s had to clarify his comments about health care and the poor.\n\n\u201cAmericans have choices, and they\u2019ve got to make a choice,\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said on CNN on Tuesday morning. \u201cAnd so maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.\u201d\n\nLater that day, Chaffetz was on Fox News clarifying his remarks. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t say it as smoothly as I possibly could, but people need to make a conscious choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in self-reliance, and they\u2019re going to have to make those decisions. We want people to have access to an affordable health-care product.\u201d\n\nA new health-care bill unveiled by Republicans as a replacement for Obamacare is now making its way through Congress. The American Health Care Act replaces federal insurance subsidies with individual tax credits and grants to help states shape their own policies. It also preserves two of the most popular features of the ACA: allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they\u2019re 26 and forbidding insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions.\n\n[If Jason Chaffetz wants to compare health care to iPhones, let\u2019s do it the right way]\n\nAfter 18 hours of debate, the bill passed 23 to 16 in the House Ways and Means Committee before dawn on Thursday.\n\nAmy Goldstein, Elise Vieback, Sean Sullivan, Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.\n\nConservatives meet with Trump, who hints that GOP ACA fix could drift further right\n\nThe GOP is walking into an Obamacare minefield right now"}, "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/US-Man-Makes-Bomb-Wants-to-Kill-Muslims-Gets-90-Days-in-Jail-20160327-0001.html": {"title": "US Man Makes Bomb, Wants to Kill Muslims, Gets 90 Days in Jail", "keywords": ["United States", " Donald Trump", " US & Canada", " USElection2016", " Human rights", " Terrorism"], "url": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/US-Man-Makes-Bomb-Wants-to-Kill-Muslims-Gets-90-Days-in-Jail-20160327-0001.html", "text": ""}, "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Despite-Still-Being-Unsigned-Colin-Kaepernick-Continues-1-Million-Donation-Pledge-to-Activist-Groups-20170604-0016.html": {"title": "Despite Still Being Unsigned, Colin Kaepernick Continues $1 Million Donation Pledge to Activist Groups", "keywords": ["United States", " Social movements", " Sport", " Colin Kaepernick", " US & Canada"], "url": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Despite-Still-Being-Unsigned-Colin-Kaepernick-Continues-1-Million-Donation-Pledge-to-Activist-Groups-20170604-0016.html", "text": ""}, "https://aeon.co/ideas/monopoly-was-invented-to-demonstrate-the-evils-of-capitalism": {"title": "Monopoly was invented to demonstrate the evils of capitalism \u2013 Kate Raworth | Ideas", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://aeon.co/ideas/monopoly-was-invented-to-demonstrate-the-evils-of-capitalism", "text": ""}, "http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/americans-joining-socialist-groups-trump-170205083615002.html": {"title": "More Americans joining socialist groups under Trump", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/americans-joining-socialist-groups-trump-170205083615002.html", "text": "Connor Southard had never been involved in political organising and had never been a member of a political organisation - until the election of the far-right US President, Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAfter that he joined the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).\n\n\n\n\"As it became clear that the organised left was getting stronger and facing more formidable threats to its agenda ... it was clearly time to get involved,\" the 26-year-old writer from New York explained.\n\n\n\nThe far-right in the United States - and in Europe - has been energised by Trump's victory and his Republican Party's firm grip on both chambers of Congress.\n\n\n\n\"The only way to oppose this level of the malignant power [of Donald Trump] is to get organised,\" Southard said. \"This moment is radicalising a lot of people due to the levels of outrage and disgust. People all over the country are asking what to do. The answer in one word is: Organise.\"\n\n\n\nHe learned about the DSA from friends and Chapo Trap House, a popular left-wing satirical podcast.\n\nSince Trump's electoral victory in November, socialist organisations have reported an explosion in membership and interest.\n\nDavid Duhalde, the DSA's deputy director, explains that the organisation's membership has soared to 16,000, more than doubling since May 2016. In the last two weeks alone, more than 2,000 new members have registered.\n\n\"We're taking advantage of the rising energy around socialism and the popular feeling that capitalism is not working for the majority of people,\" he told Al Jazeera, adding that around 50 new chapters have been founded in communities and on campuses in recent months.\n\nDSA members have participated in mass protests against Trump's inauguration, supported the Women's March, and called for the release of immigrants detained at airports owing to the new president's ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\"It's critical in our politics to promote coalition work and now to be part of a popular front against Trump,\" Duhalde explained. \"Socialists need to be in the masses of protests and doing solidarity work.\"\n\nThe Socialist Alternative, a Trotskyist party, said its membership has grown by more than 30 percent since Trump's election.\n\nThe Socialist Party USA's national secretary office said by email that they had also encountered \"a solid spike from right after the elections\", although they declined to provide further details.\n\nAlthough the numbers remain small when compared with Democratic and Republican Party membership, the growth has been significant. While fuelled by anger at Trump, the phenomenon hasn't come entirely out of the blue.\n\nConnor Kilpatrick, a writer who sits on the editorial board of Jacobin, a New York-based socialist magazine, said the failures of both mainstream US parties have played a significant role in the rise of leftist politics.\n\nIn addition to the failures of establishment Democrats and Republicans, Kilpatrick places a portion of the blame on the corporate media. His analysis is supported by the findings of a study by the mediaQuant analytics firm, which concluded that Trump had received an estimated $5bn worth of free media coverage.\n\nJust days after Trump's electoral victory, nearly every mainstream US media outlet ran segments and feature stories about a conference by the National Policy Institute, in which around 100 people celebrated Trump's win. During that conference, infamous white supremacist Richard Spencer led chants of \"Hail Trump!\" as the audience rose to its feet, making Nazi-like salutes.\n\nThat same night, around 450 people crowded into a small hall in Brooklyn to attend a talk about labour struggles hosted by Jacobin. \"It's not like there aren't socialist figures that the media could be shining their light on; they are making a decision not to,\" Kilpatrick said.\n\nTwo days before the elections, in which Trump won the electoral college by a large margin but lost the popular vote, the Gravis Marketing research firm published a survey that examined how self-described socialist Bernie Sanders would have squared off against Trump. That survey found that Sanders would have beat Trump by a 56 to 44 percent margin.\n\nSanders, a former independent who ran for the Democratic presidential slot and lost the primary to Clinton, is a US senator from Vermont. \"I think the working class is hyper-exploited and has been given nothing,\" Kilpatrick said, adding of Sanders: \"It says a lot that their favourite politician is a 75-year-old Jewish socialist.\"\n\nThe American socialist movement has grown and shrunk in ebbs and flows since its inception. Eugene V Debs, a socialist icon who ran for president five times, pulled in more than 900,000 votes during both the 1912 and 1920 elections. His Socialist Party of America's membership peaked in 1912 at around 118,000 people.\n\nBut American socialism's tumultuous history is punctuated with examples of state repression; the arrest of anti-war activists during World War I, the witch hunts led by Joseph McCarthy during the 1950s and the repression of students and other radicals during the New Left rebellion of the 1960s, among others.\n\nAlthough nationally they are weak today, an April 2016 study by Harvard University found that 51 percent of millennials - a loosely defined group of people aged between 18 and 29 - reject capitalism and 33 percent support socialism.\n\nKatie Feyh, a professor at Syracuse University who researches Marxism and rhetorical theory, argued that an already increasing interest in socialism was energised by the Sanders campaign.\n\nSanders \"showed how hungry progressives and leftists have been for an electoral formation to the left of where the Democrats have been\" for decades, Feyh told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 attracted thousands of newcomers to progressive activism.\n\nIn the 2012 presidential election, fewer than 18,000 people voted for socialist candidates, according to Latterly magazine.\n\nIn November, the Green Party's Jill Stein clinched nearly 1.5 million votes. Although not a socialist, Stein championed many left-wing causes.\n\n\n\n\"With record numbers marching against Trump, there are more people entering political activism outside the voting booth,\" Feyh explained.\n\nShe added that, while socialists are \"far from the majority\" of those participating in demonstrations against Trump, \"there is an openness to [left-wing] politics that I haven't seen in a long time\".\n\nThe American political process, while allowing for third parties, is in its essence a two-party system. From raising adequate funds to getting on ballots and securing sufficient media coverage, third parties face immense barriers.\n\nWhile the mainstream consensus tends to blame third-party candidates for \"spoiling\" close elections, in a September 2015 Gallup poll, 60 percent of interviewees supported the establishment of a viable third party because the two main parties \"do such a poor job\".\n\nKshama Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative who sits on the Seattle City Council, said her party is organising and focusing on recruitment with the hope of carving out a spot on the national level.\n\nSawant, who took office in January 2014, was the first openly socialist politician to win a citywide election in Seattle in 97 years when she unseated four-term city councillor Richard Conlin.\n\nSawant said that the question of working with progressive elements within the Democratic Party is still a point of debate on the left.\n\nWhile Sawant and the Socialist Alternative supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party primary, they urged him to run as an independent candidate after he lost to Clinton. \"We were always completely open and honest that we don't believe that the Democratic Party can be a political vehicle for putting forward a progressive agenda because its establishment leadership is so closely tied to Wall Street,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\nSawant said Democrats have further alienated progressives by urging cooperation with Trump. Following the elections, Clinton offered to work with Trump and encouraged her supporters to keep an \"open mind\".\n\nA week after the elections, former President Barack Obama also said Americans should give Trump a chance.\n\nYet Sawant said most of the young people flocking to socialist groups are not willing to negotiate over Trump's policies.\n\n\"There's no mood to negotiate,\" she said. \"There's a mood to fight back.\"\n\nThousands descended on airports in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco and elsewhere as travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries were detained last week. As the protests spread, a court froze Trump's ban on people from those countries entering the US until it can rule on its legality.\n\nSawant joined thousands of demonstrators at the Seattle-Tacoma airport. \"There were people who have never been at a protest before ... and we know that those sit-in actions and protests shutting down airports [across the US] were the principle drivers in the [freezing] of the ban.\"\n\nLast week, Trump signed a pair of executive orders scrapping several regulations placed on Wall Street. He has also vowed to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, and has publicly stated his support for the use of torture.\n\nExplaining that Trump's far-right agenda has led many to join protests, Sawant argued that it is also a \"historic opportunity\" to introduce progressive politics to a broader audience.\n\n\"We need to tie the demands for immigrants' rights to the demands of working people in general. It's no longer going to be viable to simply play defence,\" she concluded.\n\n\"The entire labour movement and everything we've fought for all these decades is on the chopping block right now. If we are going to save it, we're going to have to fight.\""}, "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pirate-bay-founder-peter-sunde-i-have-given-up": {"title": "Pirate Bay Founder: \u2018I Have Given Up\u2019", "keywords": ["motherboard", " technology", " science", " future", " environment", "Culture", "CAPITALISM", "pirate bay", "piracy", "Open Internet", "motherboard show"], "url": "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pirate-bay-founder-peter-sunde-i-have-given-up", "text": "\"The internet is shit today. It's broken. It was probably always broken, but it's worse than ever.\"\n\nMy conversation with Peter Sunde, one of the founders and spokespersons of The Pirate Bay, did not start out optimistically. There's good reason for that: In the last couple of months, the contemporary download culture shows heavy signs of defeat in the battle for the internet.\n\nLast month we saw Demonii disappear. It was the biggest torrent tracker on the internet, responsible for over 50 million trackers a year. Additionally, the MPAA took down YIFY and Popcorn Time. Then news got out that the Dutch Release Team, an uploading collective, made a legal settlement with anti-piracy group BREIN.\n\nWhile it might look like torrenters are are still fighting this battle, Sunde claims that the reality is more definitive: \"We have already lost.\"\n\nBack in 2003 Peter Sunde, together with Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm, started The Pirate Bay, a website that would become the biggest and most famous file-sharing website in the world. In 2009, the three founders were convicted of \"assisting [others] in copyright infringement\" in a highly controversial trial.\n\n\"Stop treating internet like it's a different thing and start focusing on what you actually want your society to look like.\"\n\n\n\nSunde was incarcerated in 2014 and released a year later. After his time in jail he started blogging about the centralization of power by the European Union; ran as a candidate for the Finnish Pirate Party during the elections to the European Parliament; and founded Flattr, a micro donation system for software developers.\n\nI wanted to speak with Sunde about the current state of the free and open internet, but this conversation quickly changed into an ideological exchange about society and capitalism\u2014which is, according to Sunde, the real problem.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nMOTHERBOARD: Hey Peter, I was planning on asking you if things are going well, but you made it pretty clear that that isn't the case.\n\nPeter Sunde: No, I don't see any good happening. People are too easy to content with things.\n\nTake the net neutrality law in Europe. It's terrible, but people are happy and go like \"it could be worse.\" That is absolutely not the right attitude. Facebook brings the internet to Africa and poor countries, but they're only giving limited access to their own services and make money off of poor people. And getting government grants to do that, because they do PR well.\n\nFinland actually made internet access a human right a while back. That was a clever thing of Finland. But that's like the only positive thing I have seen in any country anywhere in the world regarding the internet\n\nSo, how bad is the state of the open internet?\n\nWell, we don't have an open internet. We haven't had an open internet for a long time. So, we can't really talk about the open internet because it does not exist anymore. The problem is, nobody stops anything. We are losing privileges and rights all of the time. We are not gaining anything anywhere. The trend is just going in one direction: a more closed and more controlled internet. That has a big impact on our society. Because they are the same thing today. If you have a more oppressed internet, you have a more oppressed society. So that's something we should focus on.\n\nBut still we think of the internet like this new kind Wild West place, and things are not in chains yet, so we don't care because everything will be OK anyhow. But that is not really the case. We have never seen this amount of centralization, extreme inequality, extreme capitalism in any system before. But according to the marketing done by people like Mark Zuckerberg and companies like Google, it's all to help with the open network and to spread democracy, and so on. At the same time, they are capitalistic monopolies. So it's like trusting the enemy to do the good deeds. It is really bizarre.\n\nDo you think because a lot of people don't consider the internet to be real or a real place, they care less about its well-being?\n\nWell, one thing is, we have been growing up with an understanding of the importance of things like a telephone line or television. So if we would start to treat our telephone lines or TV channels like we treat the internet, people would get really upset. If someone would tell you, you can't call a friend, you would understand then that this is a very bad thing that is happening. You understand your rights. But people don't have that with the internet. If someone would tell you, you can't use Skype for that and that, you don't get the feeling it's about you personally. Just by being a virtual thing, it's suddenly not directed at you. You don't see someone spying on you, you don't see something censored, you don't see it when someone deletes stuff out of the search results out of Google. I think that's the biggest problem to get people's attention. You don't see the problems, so people don't feel connected to it.\n\nI would rather not care about it myself. Because it's very hard to do something about it, and not become a paranoid conspiracy person. And you don't want to be that. So rather just give up. That's kind of what people have been thinking, I think.\n\nWhat is it exactly that you have given up?\n\nWell, I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet.\n\nThe situation is not going to be any different, because apparently that is something people are not interested in fixing. Or we can't get people to care enough. Maybe it's a mixture, but this is kind of the situation we are in, so its useless to do anything about it.\n\nWe have become somehow the Black Knight from Monty Python's Holy Grail. We have maybe half of our head left and we are still fighting, we still think we have a chance of winning this battle.\n\nSo what can people do to change this?\n\nNo, I think we are at that point. I think it's really important people understand this. We lost this fight. Just admit defeat and make sure next time you understand why you lost this fight and make sure it doesn't happen again when we try and win the war.\n\nRight, so what is this war about and what should we do to win it?\n\nWell, I think, to win the war, we first of need to understand what the fight is and for me it's clear that we are dealing with ideological thing: extreme capitalism that's ruling, extreme lobbying that's ruling and the centralization of power. The internet is just a part of a bigger puzzle.\n\nAnd the other thing with activism is that you have to get momentum and attention and such. We have been really bad at that. So we stopped ACTA, but then it just came back with a different name. By that time, we had used all our resources and public attention on that.\n\nThe reason that the real world is the big target for me, is because the internet is emulating the real world. We are trying to recreate this capitalistic society we have on top of the internet. So the internet has been mostly fuel on the capitalistic fire, by kind of pretending to be something which will connect the whole world, but actually having a capitalistic agenda.\n\nLook at all the biggest companies in the world, they are all based on the internet. Look at what they are selling: nothing. Facebook has no product. Airbnb, the biggest hotel chain in the world, has no hotels. Uber, the biggest taxi company in the world, has no taxis whatsoever.\n\n\"I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet.\"\n\n\n\nThe amount of employees in these companies are smaller than ever before and the profits are, in turn, larger. Apple and Google are passing oil companies by far. Minecraft got sold for $2.6 billion and WhatsApp for like $19 billion. These are insane amounts of money for nothing. That is why the internet and capitalism are so in love with each other.\n\nYou told me the internet is broken, that it was always broken. What do you mean by that and do we have extreme capitalism to blame for it?\n\nWell, the thing is the internet is really stupid. It works really simply in a simple manner and it doesn't take any adjustments for censorship. Like, if one cable is gone, you take the traffic through some other place. But thanks to the centralization of the internet, (possible) censorship or surveillance tech is a whole lot harder to get around. Also, because the internet was an American invention, they also still have control of it and ICANN can actually force any country top level domain to be censored or disconnected. For me that's, a really broken design.\n\nBut it has always been broken, we just never really cared about it, because there always have been a few good people that made sure that nothing bad happened before. But I think that's the wrong idea. Rather let bad thing happen as quick as possible so we can fix them and make sure it does not happen in the future. We are prolonging this inevitable total failure, which is not helping us at all.\n\nSo, we should just let it crash and burn down, pick up the pieces and start over?\n\nYes, with the focus on the big war on this extreme capitalism. I couldn't vote, but I was hoping Sarah Palin won last time in the US elections. I'm hoping Donald Trump wins this year's election. For the reason that it will fuck up that country so much faster then if a less bad President wins. Our whole world is just so focused on money, money, money. That's the biggest problem. That's why everything fucks up. That's the target we have to fix. We need to make sure that we are going to get a different focus in life.\n\n\"We don't have an open internet. We haven't had an open internet for a long time.\"\n\n\n\nHopefully technology will give us robots that will take away all the jobs, which will cause like a massive worldwide unemployment; somewhat like 60 percent. People will be so unhappy. That would be great, because then you can finally see capitalism crashing so hard. There is going to be a lot of fear, lost blood, and lost lives to get to that point, but I think that's the only positive thing I see, that we are going to have a total system collapse in the future. Hopefully as quick as possible. I would rather be 50 then be like 85 when the system is crashing.\n\nThis all sounds quite like some sort of Marxist revolution: a total crash of the capitalist system.\n\nWell, yeah, I totally agree with that. I'm a socialist. I know Marx and communism did not work before, but I think in the future you have the possibility of having total communism and equal access to everything for everybody. Most people I meet, no matter if they are a communist or a capitalist, agree with me on this, because they understand the potential.\n\nSo, is there like a concrete thing we should focus on? Or do we need to aim for a new way of thinking? A new ideology?\n\nWell, I think the focus needs to be that the internet is exactly the same as society. People might realize that it's not a really good idea to have all of our data and files on Google, Facebook and company servers. All of these things need to be communicated al the way to the political top, of course. But stop treating internet like it's a different thing and start focusing on what you actually want your society to look like. We have to fix society, before we can fix the internet. That's the only thing."}, "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-calls-on-government-to-requisition-luxury-homes-for-the-grenfell-tower-fire-homeless_uk_5942b29be4b01eab7a2c179f?cg": {"title": "Corbyn: Use 'Luxury' Homes To House Grenfell Residents", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-calls-on-government-to-requisition-luxury-homes-for-the-grenfell-tower-fire-homeless_uk_5942b29be4b01eab7a2c179f?cg", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn has called for empty \u201cluxury\u201d homes owned by foreign investors to be used to help those left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire. The Labour leader said the Government should \u201crequisition\u201d nearby expensive properties to ensure residents were housed locally. His radical plan came as MPs met for the first time to discuss the blaze that left 17 people dead, with scores missing and many left in a critical condition in hospital. Speaking during an emergency meeting in the House of Commons with Fire and Policing Minister Nick Hurd, Corbyn said that he was \u201cvery angry\u201d that so many people had lost their lives in the blaze in the west London tower block. Hurd described the Grenfell Tower fire as a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d and said a full search was \u201cunlikely to be feasible for some time\u201d.\n\nHousing Minister Alok Sharma said the Government will work with the local authority to \u201cguarantee\u201d that every single family from Grenfell Tower will be rehoused locally. But Corbyn made clear he wanted much more radical and urgent action. \u201cKensington is a tale of two cities. The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it\u2019s the wealthiest part of the whole country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ward where this fire took place is, I think, the poorest ward in the whole country and properties must be found - requisitioned if necessary - to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally. \u201cIt can\u2019t be acceptable that in London we have luxury buildings and luxury flats left empty as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live. We have to address these issues.\u201d\n\nCorbyn was backed by David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham who earlier on Thursday said that those responsible for the fire should be charged with \u2018corporate manslaughter\u2019. \u201cThis is the richest borough in our country treating its citizens in this way,\u201d Lammy told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe should call it what it is, it\u2019s corporate manslaughter, that\u2019s what it is and there should be arrests made, frankly.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of homes in London have been left uninhabited for years, according to some studies. Islington Council is one of several councils trying to ban owners of new homes from leaving them empty for more than three months. A new report, commissioned by the Mayor of London and the London School of Economics and the University of York, this week found overseas investors made up 13.2% of all property transactions between 2014 and 2016. But while it found just one per cent of those homes were left empty, it also discovered more expensive properties were more likely to be vacant. \u201cHigher [vacancy] rates were found in homes in prime London, more expensive homes (particularly those worth more than \u00a35m), and homes bought by overseas buyers,\u201d the report said. The 90-minute Commons meeting was held informally in Westminster Hall rather than the Commons chamber because Parliament has not fully reopened after the snap general election. Hurd\u2019s statement was not even initially televised before the cameras were switched on after more than 40 minutes.\n\nCorbyn said: \u201cIt\u2019s not satisfactory that we should be meeting in Westminster Hall while only half of it is recorded on camera.\u201d He demanded that ministers report to parliament when it resumes next week to update MPs on what steps they are taking in reaction to the tragedy. Housing minister Sharma said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working with the local authority and the Government to guarantee that every single family from Grenfell House will be rehoused in the local area. \u201cThat is a very clear reassurance which I hope colleagues will feel is useful.\u201d Labour MP Andy Slaughter, whose seat neighbours Kensington, said: \u201cI have been on-site this morning and yesterday. \u201cNothing, not even the images on the media, prepare you for the utterly horrific sight - one I think unprecedented in our country.\u201d"}, "https://telesurtv.net/english/news/JFK-Files-Expose-CIA-Plot-to-Stage-Miami-Bombings-and-Blame-Fidel-Castro-20171027-0013.html": {"title": "JFK Files Expose CIA Plot to Stage Miami Bombings and Blame Fidel Castro", "keywords": ["Caribbean", " Cuba-US Relations", " United States"], "url": "https://telesurtv.net/english/news/JFK-Files-Expose-CIA-Plot-to-Stage-Miami-Bombings-and-Blame-Fidel-Castro-20171027-0013.html", "text": ""}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/new-zealand-new-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-capitalism-blatant-failure-a8012656.html": {"title": "New Zealand\u2019s new prime minister brands capitalism a \u2018blatant failure\u2019", "keywords": ["New Zealand", " Jacinda Ardern", " Capitalism", " Australasia", " World", " News"], "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/new-zealand-new-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-capitalism-blatant-failure-a8012656.html", "text": "New Zealand's new prime minister called capitalism a \"blatant failure\", before citing levels of homelessness and low wages as evidence that \"the market has failed\" her country's poor.\n\nJacinda Ardern, who is to become the nation's youngest leader since 1856, said measures used to gauge economic success \"have to change\" to take into account \"people's ability to actually have a meaningful life\".\n\nThe 37-year-old will take office next month after the populist New Zealand First party agreed to form a centre-left coalition with her Labour Party.

According to LendEDU, 43.3 million borrowers in the U.S. collectively hold an outstanding student loan debt totaling $1.41 trillion.\n\n60 percent of Americans graduate college with student debt, and on average, each borrower owes $28,400. The average default rate on federal student loans sits at 11.8 percent.\n\nAll this being said, the $1.41 trillion in outstanding student loan debt is still a ways off from the $10.6 trillion in mortgage debt during the peak of the Great Recession. However, student debt in the U.S. is now the second largest class of debt, above credit cards.\n\nLendEDU wanted to see how millennials, the largest living generation in the world, thought the student loan debt crisis in the U.S. stacked up against other serious threats that the country will be dealing with in the coming years.\n\nLendEDU commissioned a poll that asked 515 millennials with student debt the following: \u201cWhat is a bigger problem facing the United States?\u201d\n\nMillennials were nearly split down the middle in terms of deciding if global warming or the student loan crisis is the biggest problem facing the U.S.\n\n250 millennials, or 48.5 percent, think the $1.41 trillion student loan crisis is a more serious issue for the U.S. than global warming is.\n\nThe remaining 265 respondents, or 51.5 percent, believe global warming is a bigger threat facing this country.\n\nConsidering millennial\u2019s thoughts on global warming, this poll produced some mildly surprising results. In a poll conducted by the University of Texas at Austin in the fall of 2016, 91 percent of millennials believed climate change is occurring, the highest percentage ever. For reference, 74 percent of seniors aged 65 and older said climate change is occurring.\n\nMillennials represent the generation that most staunchly believes in global warming, and this will be the demographic that will lead the fight against climate change in the coming years.\n\nThe fact that virtually half of them believe the student loan crisis is a more serious threat to the U.S. than global warming, which may wipe out entire cities, is a telling indication of the severity of this country\u2019s educational debts.\n\nThe second question of LendEDU\u2019s poll posed the following question to 544 millennials: \u201cWhat is a bigger problem facing the United States?\u201d\n\nUnlike the first question regarding global warming, millennials left no doubt that they think the student loan crisis is a bigger threat to the U.S. than is North Korea.\n\n379 participants, or 69.7 percent, think the $1.41 trillion student loan debt situation is a bigger threat than North Korea.\n\nOn the other side, 165 millennials, or 30.3 percent, believe North Korea poses more of a threat than does the student loan crisis.\n\nOne could make a strong argument that North Korea presents the greatest international threat to the U.S. At this point, many foreign policy experts believe it is a case of \u201cwhen,\u201d and not \u201cif,\u201d the North Koreans develop a long-range nuclear missile that could reach the U.S. mainland.\n\nThat being said, more than two times the amount of millennials still believe the student loan crisis poses a bigger threat to the U.S. than the rogue regime of North Korea, a testament to just how serious this nation\u2019s student loan debt crisis is.\n\nThe poll was commissioned by LendEDU and conducted by online polling company, Whatsgoodly. In total, 515 current college students were polled from June 2, 2017 to June 14, 2017 for the first question. For the second question, 544 current college students were polled from June 2, 2017 to June 14, 2017. Respondents were allowed to participate in the poll if they currently were holding student debt. The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that there are 20.5 million current college students in the United States. We estimate that our sample is representative of that population within a margin of error of +-4.30%, and +-4.20%, respectively. Respondents were asked to answer each of the following questions truthfully: \"What is the bigger problem facing the United States?\" (global warming or $1.4 trillion student loan crisis) and \"What is the bigger problem facing the United States?\" (North Korea or $1.4 trillion student loan crisis)"}, "https://www.rt.com/news/414459-israeli-teens-refuse-idf-occupation/": {"title": "Israeli teens tell Netanyahu they won\u2019t serve in IDF, slam occupation of Palestine", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.rt.com/news/414459-israeli-teens-refuse-idf-occupation/", "text": "Sixty-three Israeli students signed a letter stating they would defy mandatory military service despite the risk of jail. Citing the occupation of Palestine, the letter criticizes the policies of Israel\u2019s \u201cracist government.\u201d\n\nThe letter, signed on Thursday by sixty-three high school students from across Israel, is addressed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot.\n\nPointing to Israel\u2019s blockade on the Gaza Strip and illegal West Bank settlements, the letter states that \u201cthe army implements the policy of a racist government that violates basic human rights, which applies one law to Israelis and another to the Palestinians in the same area.\u201d\n\nBlaming the Israeli government and IDF for decades of violent conflict, the students wrote they \u201cdecided not to take part in the occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people, which separates people into two hostile camps. Because as long as people live under occupation that denies them human rights and national rights we will not be able to achieve peace.\u201d\n\nThe signatories also said that Israelis are exposed to a culture of \u201cmilitarism\u201d from a young age, and that they want to \u201cchange the entire system.\u201d\n\nThe IDF has not formally responded to the letter, but Yesh Atid MK Elazar Stern, a retired IDF major general, called the letter \u201csad\u201d but \u201cmarginal.\u201d\u201cI think our youth is committed enough to handle these marginal types.

However, Israel\u2019s Arab minority is exempt from mandatory service. Men serve for two years and eight months, and women for two years.\n\nAlthough such cases are rare, the IDF has previously jailed young conscientious objectors who have refused to serve. In July, 19-year-old Noa Gur Golan was detained in a military prison for defying her draft orders. In an open letter she wrote before refusing to enlist, Golan said she could not be complicit in a \u201creality where violence is the norm.\u201d\n\nIn a similar incident in 2014, 53 graduates of Jerusalem's Arts and Science Academy signed a letter declaring their refusal to serve in the military. The alumni of the prestigious university wrote that the IDF was a \"contractor in active segregation based on the concept of ethnic superiority of the Jews over Palestinians \u2013 a regime that oppresses and tramples basic human rights, which applies a different legal system to the different populations in the West Bank, and uses a system of discrimination based on ethnic lines from 1948.\"\n\nThe United Nations has repeatedly called on Israel to withdraw from occupied Palestinian territory. In March, the UN\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) published a report accusing Israel \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d of being guilty of \u201cpolicies and practices that constitute the crime of apartheid\u201d against the Palestinian people."}, "http://www.inquisitr.com/3932163/noam-chomsky-calls-for-militant-labor-movement-to-transform-american-politics-and-fight-trump/": {"title": "Noam Chomsky Calls For \u2018Militant Labor Movement\u2019 To Transform American Politics And Fight Trump", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/3932163/noam-chomsky-calls-for-militant-labor-movement-to-transform-american-politics-and-fight-trump/", "text": "Noam Chomsky, a distinguished professor of linguistics at MIT and a long-time political activist, has called for a \u201cmilitant labor movement\u201d in the United States to revitalize American politics and take on the Donald Trump administration and the rest of the corporate-owned political establishment.\n\nIn a recent Alternet interview, Noam Chomsky explains the rise of right-wing populist movements in Britain and the United States that led to Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as largely a reaction to the failures of neoliberal policies of the past several decades to improve the lives of working-class people. In fact, these policies have only served to concentrate wealth in the hands of the rich, increase inflation, and keep wages low. In this light, it\u2019s no mystery why people are looking to new solutions.\n\nNoam Chomsky told the interviewer that neoliberal programs \u201chave just cast a huge number of people to the side. These programs have improved corporate profit, kept wages stagnant, and highly concentrated wealth and power. They\u2019ve undermined democracy.\u201d\n\nChomsky goes on to explain that neoliberal policies in place since the late 1970s in the United States have created a situation where the extremely wealthy are reaping huge rewards while many in the working class are struggling to get ahead. Chomsky explains support for Trump as a function of resentment by certain segments of the population for policies they see as elevating those who haven\u2019t worked as hard as they have while doing nothing to help them increase their quality of life.\n\n\u201cTrump supporters are not necessarily very poor\u2014some of them are moderately well-off, they have jobs, but then, the image that\u2019s been used, which is not a bad one, I think, is that they are people who see themselves as standing in line trying to get ahead. That they\u2019ve worked hard, they\u2019ve \u2018done\u2019 their place in line, and they\u2019re stuck there. The people ahead of them are shooting off into the stratosphere, and the people behind them, in their view, are being pushed ahead in the line by the federal government. That\u2019s what the federal government does [in their view]\u2014it takes people who are behind them and who haven\u2019t worked hard enough they way they have, and pushes them ahead by some supportive programs.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Independent, Noam Chomsky had previously discussed the failure of the Democratic Party to appeal to working class voters by highlighting a need for a \u201cmilitant labor movement\u201d in the United States, which could appeal to working-class voters let down by empty calls for \u201chope and change\u201d from Barack Obama and other neoliberal Democrats. Speaking before the crowd at Democracy Now\u2019s 20th-anniversary event in December of last year, Chomsky explained that the seeds of such a movement have already been planted in the movement to elect Bernie Sanders as President in 2016.\n\n\u201cSuppose people like you, the Sanders movement, offered an authentic, constructive program for real hope and change, it would win these people back,\u201d Chomsky said.\n\nNoam Chomsky is correct in recognizing that it has historically been labor movements, and not power-players in the political establishment, who have been the most successful in advancing the interests of the American working-class.\n\nAccording to Worker\u2019s Compass, the labor movement in the early 1950\u2019s did not have a serious ally in Democratic President Harry Truman. Worker solidarity at the time played a large role in advancing the cause of worker\u2019s rights, often in spite of efforts by Truman and the Democrats to counter the labor movement\u2019s goals.\n\n\u201cIn 1950 Democrat President Truman tried to smash a strike of 100,000 miners by invoking the Taft-Hartley Act (legislation that greatly restricted strikes),\u201d the article says. \u201cIn protest, 270,000 additional miners joined the strike. Soon the mine owners backed down, and the miners won a substantial wage increase.\u201d\n\nTruman, who initially tried to veto the Taft-Hartley Act, nevertheless invoked the law a total of 61 times during his administration, and in 1951, President Truman raised taxes on working people by 12 percent while raising taxes on millionaires by only one percent. This type of duplicitous, anti-worker action continues to haunt the Democratic Party today, whose neoliberal Presidents Clinton and Obama don\u2019t seem very much different from Ronald Reagan in terms of attitudes toward policies to strengthen the working poor and the middle class.\n\nA militant labor movement in the United States, as Noam Chomsky advocates, could go a long way in challenging the pro-corporate neoliberalism that has dominated both parties in American government since the Reagan administration."}, "https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/11/19/fake-news-only-beginning-fcc-votes-let-monopolies-decide-what-local-news-you-see": {"title": "Fake News Is Only the Beginning.

Nifty way to reduce down to just one newsroom then dictate whatever information that corporation does \u2014 and does not \u2014 want you to know in this democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened with radio. Back in the day when lots of companies owned 40 radio stations, the broadcast industry made big promises that local information would be much more diverse if they could simply own many more stations. The 1996 Telecommunications Act resulted in a handful of corporations owning thousands of stations \u2014 and force feeding conservative programming down our country\u2019s throats ever since, no debate, no opposing opinions allowed.\n\nThe Media Action Center showed during the Scott Walker recall in Wisconsin that \u201cconservative\u201d radio giants there gave millions of dollars in free airtime to the GOP candidate \u2014 while refusing to allow a single Democrat on the air at all. GOP operatives there still gloat about radio winning elections for them. After 21 years of this kind of divisive public policy, 60 million people listen to conservative radio, about the same number that voted for Donald Trump.\n\nNow the FCC is quietly trying to do the same thing to our local TV stations. In 2003, when they just tried to allow TV stations to own newspapers, 3 million people rose up and said \u201cNo!\u201d Now they want to allow the newspapers plus all the TV stations in one town to have the same owner, and they\u2019re not even asking for public comment.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Commissioners are in a PR frenzy to have us believe TV is dying. Chair Ajit V. Pai tweeted \u201cAmong Americans aged 18-29, online streaming is primary means of watching TV.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Michael O\u2019Rielly, citing Pew Research, writes: \u201cBy 2016, only 46 percent of respondents viewed broadcast TV as a source of news and 38 percent \u2018got news yesterday\u2019 from an online source,\u201d then talks about people getting news from Google and Facebook.\n\nBut what matters is not whether we stream on a device or watch on a big screen. What matters is the integrity and diversity of our information.\n\nGoogle and Facebook don\u2019t produce news or hire reporters to ferret out what\u2019s going on at City Hall or the state Capitol or White House. That\u2019s the terrain of newspapers and TV broadcasters.\n\nIndependent online news organizations are growing, but their influence is negligible: According to August 2017 Pew studies, about 52 million people watch local TV news, compared to about 23 million who access digitally produced news, but those 23 million people may visit the online news sites just once a month \u2014 for an average of just 2.4 minutes. The FCC\u2019s argument doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nSo why does the broadcast industry want the FCC to consolidate to such an alarming degree? It\u2019s not money. Fortune Magazine cites record industry profits, with BIA/Kelsey reporting that local television station revenue reached $28.4 billion in 2016. They\u2019re rolling in the dough, so why the sudden push to change things?\n\nWe know why. We know why Sinclair Broadcasting, renowned for its alt-right editorializing over our public airwaves, wants to reach 72 percent of U.S. homes with its propaganda. We know this\n\nWhite House\u2019s agenda. We know what happens when we allow just a few companies to control everything we read, see and hear. We know.\n\nMedia reform group Free Press President Craig Aaron says if the FCC doesn\u2019t abandon this plan, \u201cthey\u2019ll find themselves back in court for failing to study the issue, take public input, and address the fact that so few stations are owned by women and people of color. We\u2019ve won this fight before, and we can prevail again.\u201d\n\nThey won this fight before because 3 million Americans stood up for free speech.\n\nStand up.

A major focus of his campaign was on removing immigrants who, he said, were increasing crime in American communities.\n\nIn his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump named victims who were reportedly killed by undocumented immigrants and said:\n\nNow as president, he has signed executive orders that restrict entry of immigrants from seven countries into the U.S. and authorize the construction of a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He also signed an order to prioritize the removal of \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d and withhold federal funding from \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d\n\nBut, what does research say about how immigration impacts crime in U.S. communities? We turned to our experts for answers.\n\nRobert Adelman, University at Buffalo, and Lesley Reid, University of Alabama\n\nResearch has shown virtually no support for the enduring assumption that increases in immigration are associated with increases in crime.\n\nImmigration-crime research over the past 20 years has widely corroborated the conclusions of a number of early 20th-century presidential commissions that found no backing for the immigration-crime connection. Although there are always individual exceptions, the literature demonstrates that immigrants commit fewer crimes, on average, than native-born Americans.\n\nAlso, large cities with substantial immigrant populations have lower crime rates, on average, than those with minimal immigrant populations.\n\nIn a paper published this year in the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice, we, along with our colleagues Gail Markle, Saskia Weiss and Charles Jaret, investigated the immigration-crime relationship.\n\nWe analyzed census data spanning four decades from 1970 to 2010 for 200 randomly selected metropolitan areas, which include center cities and surrounding suburbs. Examining data over time allowed us to assess whether the relationship between immigration and crime changed with the broader U.S. economy and the origin and number of immigrants.\n\nThe most striking finding from our research is that for murder, robbery, burglary and larceny, as immigration increased, crime decreased, on average, in American metropolitan areas. The only crime that immigration had no impact on was aggravated assault. These associations are strong and stable evidence that immigration does not cause crime to increase in U.S. metropolitan areas, and may even help reduce it.\n\nThere are a number of ideas among scholars that explain why more immigration leads to less crime. The most common explanation is that immigration reduces levels of crime by revitalizing urban neighborhoods, creating vibrant communities and generating economic growth.\n\nCharis E. Kubrin, University of California, Irvine, and Graham Ousey, College of William and Mary\n\nFor the last decade, we have been studying how immigration to an area impacts crime.\n\nAcross our studies, one finding remains clear: Cities and neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower rates of crime and violence, all else being equal.\n\nOur research also points to the importance of city context for understanding the immigration-crime relationship. In one study, for example, we found that cities with historically high immigration levels are especially likely to enjoy reduced crime rates as a result of their immigrant populations.\n\nFindings from our most recent study, forthcoming in the inaugural issue of The Annual Review of Criminology, only strengthen these conclusions.\n\nWe conducted a meta-analysis, meaning we systematically evaluated available research on the immigration-crime relationship in neighborhoods, cities and metropolitan areas across the U.S. We examined findings from more than 50 studies published between 1994 and 2014, including studies conducted by our copanelists, Adelman and Reid.\n\nOur analysis of the literature reveals that immigration has a weak crime-suppressing effect. In other words, more immigration equals less crime.\n\nThere were some individual studies that found that with an increase in immigration, there was an increase in crime. However, there were 2.5 times as many findings that showed immigration was actually correlated with less crime. And, the most common finding was that immigration had no impact on crime.\n\nThe upshot? We find no evidence to indicate that immigration leads to more crime and it may, in fact, suppress it.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

This time, Reddit\u2019s leadership is taking aim at content and groups that incite violence, and the first groups to fall are Nazi and Nazi-sympathizing subreddits.\n\nThe policy change announced on r/modnews (and not r/announcements, for reasons unknown) notes that previous site definitions for \u201cinciting violence\u201d were deemed not to be \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d and have been amended. As site admin landoflobsters wrote:\n\n[W]e found that the policy regarding \u201cinciting\u201d violence was too vague, and so we have made an effort to adjust it to be more clear and comprehensive. Going forward, we will take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, we will also take action against content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. This applies to ALL content on Reddit, including memes, CSS/community styling, flair, subreddit names, and usernames.\n\nBad news for puerile idiots or propagandizing fascists\u2014great news for basically everyone else.\n\n\n\nSo far, at least seven communities have been kicked off of Reddit, including r/Nazi, r/EuropeanNationalism, and r/pol (an extension of the 4chan board of the same name.) Of these, the largest had under 7,000 subscribers and the smallest had just 25. One was previously \u201cquarantined\u201d\u2014a state where communities with content deemed to be \u201cextremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor\u201d are only available to logged-in users who know where to look.\n\nOf course, speculation abounds among users as to whether or not this tweak in the site rules will be used to justify banning r/the_donald, the race-baiting, mod-threatening, and ostensibly Trump-centered community which has at various points declared \u201cwar\u201d on the rest of Reddit.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Reddit for comment and will update if we hear back.\n\nUpdate 10/26/17 12:40pm ET: The community is working to keep track of which communities have been banned, but given how small many are, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever get a full list of removed content. Still, the currently accepted total for banned subreddits is 18, and in addition to violent or fascistic communities, Reddit appears to have also taken an interest in removing beastiality content. So long r/SexWithHorses, we hardly knew ye.\n\nUpdate 11/8/17 8:36am ET: Reddit\u2019s moderation staff took the liberty of adding r/incels to their list of banned communities yesterday evening. For those fortunate enough not to know, \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d are a particular subset of people (almost entirely male) who blame externalities (almost always women) for their inability to have sex. In short: angry virgins.\n\nIt does not appear any one thread triggered the ban, but caches of the community from last night show r/incels briefly displayed the following message\u2014The moderators of this subreddit have set it to private. You must be a moderator or approved submitter to visit\u2014which suggests the subreddit moderators may have attempted to evade the ban. An attempt at a replacement\u2014r/incelpurgatory\u2014was also met with swift removal.\n\nWith 42,000 subscribers, r/incels is the largest group removed from Reddit during this wave of bans to date.\n\nUpdate 11/8/17 4:09pm ET: Within the past two hours, another two communities have been banned: r/opiatefriendly and r/steroidsourcetalk. While there don\u2019t appear to be any caches versions of the former, the latter had around 20,000 subscribers."}, "http://thehill.com/homenews/news/337270-corbyn-vows-to-force-may-to-resign-within-a-matter-of-days-after-disastrous": {"title": "Corbyn vows to force May to resign 'within a matter of days'", "keywords": ["", "", ""], "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/news/337270-corbyn-vows-to-force-may-to-resign-within-a-matter-of-days-after-disastrous", "text": "Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn went on the offensive in an interview with the Daily Mirror on Saturday, vowing to oust Prime Minister Theresa May of the Conservatives \"within a matter of days.\"\n\n\u201cI can still be Prime Minister.

It is very likely this candidate: 1) Isn\u2019t your first choice, 2) Isn\u2019t 100% ideologically pure, 3) Has made mistakes in their life, 4) Might not really excite you all that much, 5) Has ideas you are uncomfortable with.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease start the process of getting over that shit now, instead of waiting until 2020,\u201d it concluded.\n\nThe meme echoes some of the common complaints around the treatment of Hillary Clinton (and, by extension, all centrist candidates) during the 2016 election. Many liberals and Clinton supporters still believe that Clinton\u2019s loss can be heavily attributed to the fierce criticism she received from the Left, particularly during the Democratic primary. Others condemned the \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d contingent, particularly those who disrupted the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a long-running critique of any party\u2019s progressive base: that instead of simply holding their nose and accepting someone who is a flawed but acceptable candidate, they sabotage moderates\u2019 chances at leadership, thereby bringing a much worse alternative to power.\n\nYet these familiar arguments appeared to have vanished for some high-profile liberals when it comes to the case of Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn pulled off unexpected gains in yesterday\u2019s elections, he did it without the assistance of some high-profile liberal voices.\n\nWhen France stood poised between electing racist populist Marine Le Pen and and neoliberal supply-sider Emmanuel Macron, Obama intervened, explicitly endorsing Macron in a seventy-second video, arguing that he \u201chas stood up for liberal values\u201d and \u201cappeals to people\u2019s hopes, and not their fears.\u201d This was on top of the \u201cbromantic\u201d phone call he had with Macron, which many interpreted as a coded message of support in a country where Obama has a 90 percent approval rating.\n\nMacron likely didn\u2019t need the push, as he was already leading against Le Pen. But Obama had told the public he would step into public life when he thought \u201cour core values may be at stake.\u201d\n\nYet when the contest in the United Kingdom came down to Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn and the Conservatives\u2019 Theresa May, Obama was nowhere to be found.\n\nOf course, the Labour Manifesto was a strong set of social-democratic policies that most Democrats would tell you they would be happy to put forward in the United States (with the caveat of \u201cif only it were politically possible\u201d). Macron, by contrast, believes in GOP-style tax cuts for the rich, deregulation, and once told an unemployed protester who said he couldn\u2019t afford a suit that \u201cthe best way to pay for a suit is to work for one.\u201d\n\nAt the same time Labour was fighting for eleventh-hour votes, Obama found the time to \u201cbring the bromance back\u201d by sitting down for dinner with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, the latest in Trudeau\u2019s series of faux-spontaneous, internet-courting publicity stunts.\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s a simpler explanation: Beyond issues of decorum and precedent, perhaps the reason for the silence is correct: Obama is just not that committed to left-wing political change. After all, he suggested in an interview last year that Labour under Corbyn had lost touch with \u201cfact and reality.\u201d\n\nAnother high-profile liberal figure \u2014 a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d \u2014 who could have used her popularity and influence to build up enthusiasm for Labour in advance of the vote was Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, an outspoken Labour supporter. Rowling has spent the better part of the last year relentlessly criticizing Corbyn, both for his ideas and his electability. For example:\n\nAccused of opposing Corbyn because, as a possible billionaire, her taxes could rise significantly under Corbyn, she insisted her opposition to Corbyn was purely out of concern that he was hurting Labour\u2019s chances of kicking out the Tories.\n\n\u201cLabour has never won an election from polling numbers like his,\u201d she said in September 2016. \u201cI want a strong, electable Labour party, which is why I despair that Corbyn is leader,\u201d she said in April. \u201cHe is killing their chances.\u201d She complained that she and others had been labelled \u201cRed Tories\u201d simply \u201cfor wanting to win elections.\u201d\n\nYou might have thought that, with Labour surging in the polls from May onward, Rowling might have been thrilled to see that her party\u2019s fortunes had turned around. You might have even thought Rowling would send out encouraging tweets to her millennial fanbase, given Corbyn\u2019s campaign was so dependent on youth turnout.\n\nInstead, Rowling\u2019s election-related tweets went cold, until June 8, when she urged people to vote for Labour MP Jess Phillips. As voters went to the polls, Rowling bafflingly tweeted about a \u201cgrinding sense of hopelessness.\u201d\n\nTony Blair, the former Labour prime minister and famous Third Way pragmatist whose core philosophy was that the Labour party had to reflexively compromise on its ideals, was similarly unenthused about Corbyn. He refused to endorse Corbyn prior to the election, said that Labour was not providing a \u201ccompetitive\u201d opposition that was a threat to the Tories, and had earlier accused Corbyn of reducing the party to a \u201cfringe protest movement.\u201d (To be fair, Blair\u2019s refusal to follow his own philosophy and be pragmatic and endorse a Labour leader who he didn\u2019t entirely agree with was undoubtedly a good thing: he\u2019s a warmonger, as well as being widely disliked by the British public). Likewise, former chancellor and Blairite Alistair Darling refused to endorse Corbyn in the run up to the election, saying that he was the leader \u201cright up until the general election\u201d and that \u201cleaders come and go.\u201d\n\nThen you\u2019ve got members of the press. Columnist Sarah Ditum, who is also a Labour party member, wrote a widely shared piece in April 18 for the liberal New Statesman, titled \u201cWhat should you do if you support Labour but can\u2019t stand Jeremy Corbyn?\u201d Unlike Rowling and others, Ditum made clear that her opposition to Corbyn wasn\u2019t based on electability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that Corbyn is unpopular. It\u2019s not even just that he\u2019s incompetent,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s unconscionable. In the most serious possible way, it is morally intolerable to imagine Corbyn as Prime Minister.\u201d For this reason, she explained, \u201cI can\u2019t campaign for Corbyn.\u201d (Ditum had no such objections to Hillary Clinton, who is not only directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people through the wars she voted for, but, as we recently found out, also owned slaves).\n\nNew Statesman editor Jason Cowley has been likewise less than positive about Labour in the lead-up to the election. In February, he warned that \u201cThe Zombie Party is too weak to win.\u201d At the close of March, he alerted readers that \u201cthe stench of decay and failure coming from the Labour Party is now overwhelming.\u201d Two days before voting, he wrote a piece questioning if Labour was headed towards its worst election defeat since 1935.\n\nCowley wrote no articles about Labour\u2019s manifesto, which even former Corbyn skeptics on the Left like Polly Toynbee enthused about at the time. But he did find the time to gush about the newly elected Emmanuel Macron, who he argued was leading \u201ca populist eruption from the liberal center.\u201d\n\nAll this should come as no surprise, because it\u2019s happened in the United States too. After weeks and months of complaints about the Left\u2019s \u201cideological purity\u201d and the lack of unity among the Democratic base following Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss, a troupe of Obama loyalists couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of the Sanders-endorsed Keith Ellison running the DNC. So they actively sought out and recruited another candidate, the more establishment-friendly Tom Perez, with Ellison\u2019s opponents specifically citing his views on Israel to justify their opposition.\n\nOf course, most people did not hold out. As mentioned, the Guardian\u2019s Polly Toynbee came around following the release of Labour\u2019s manifesto. So did the New Statesman\u2019s John Elledge. Comedian Steve Coogan, a former Corbyn critic, became a powerful voice in his favor. John Braggins, a former adviser to Blair, wrote a public apology to Corbyn over his earlier hostility to him.\n\nBut all of these examples \u2014 along with the comparative dearth of liberal voices now calling for voters to abandon \u201cideological purity\u201d and vote for the \u201clesser evil\u201d when it comes to a farther-left candidate \u2014 should remind us to be skeptical of such calls in the first place. Rather than neutral appeals to reason, they\u2019ve been cynical arguments deployed almost exclusively for centrist candidates."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change": {"title": "Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says", "keywords": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Climate change", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Business", "ExxonMobil", "BP", "Royal Dutch Shell", "Chevron", "Oil and gas companies"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change", "text": "Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report.\n\n\n\nThe Carbon Majors Report (pdf) \u201cpinpoints how a relatively small set of fossil fuel producers may hold the key to systemic change on carbon emissions,\u201d says Pedro Faria, technical director at environmental non-profit CDP, which published the report in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute.\n\nTraditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. Compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change.\n\nThe report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since 1988 \u2013 the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established \u2013 can be traced to just 25 corporate and state-owned entities. The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report.\n\nExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.\n\nWhile companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says Faria, the barrier is the \u201cabsolute tension\u201d between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.\n\nA Carbon Tracker study in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables \u2013 in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.\n\nCDP says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings.\n\nA fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. \u201cThat puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,\u201d says Faria.\n\nInvestors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. \u201cNot only is it morally risky, it\u2019s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.\u201d\n\nThere is a \u201cgrowing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,\u201d says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the RE100 initiative. Volvo recently announced that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019.\n\nAnd oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. Shell set up a renewables arm in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for Chevron says it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions\u201d and is investing in two of the world\u2019s largest carbon dioxide injection projects to capture and store carbon. A BP spokesperson says its \u201cdetermined to be part of the solution\u201d for climate change and is \u201cinvesting in renewables and low-carbon innovation.\u201d And ExxonMobil, which has faced heavy criticism for its environmental record, has been exploring carbon capture and storage.\n\nBut for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a \u201cnasty, brutish and short\u201d end within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models.\n\nInvestors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. \u201cThe future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops?\u201d"}, "https://www.rt.com/business/415465-bezos-amazon-richest-ever-billions/": {"title": "Richest man in history: Amazon\u2019s Bezos earns more in 5 days than most could in 5 lifetimes", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.rt.com/business/415465-bezos-amazon-richest-ever-billions/", "text": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has become the wealthiest person in history and the first to outrank Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates on the rich list, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

They define themselves as American fascists or American nationalists, focused on preserving America's identity.\n\nIn recent weeks, Patriot Front posters appeared on downtown Burlington bulletin boards, and racist anti-immigrant posters were put up on the University of Vermont green as students were returning to classes after Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nWhen reports from anti-fascist groups emerged on Twitter saying that Patriot Front was coming to town to rally and spread their hate, students at the University of Vermont (UVM) and Burlington residents decided enough was enough.\n\nThey responded in a united fashion, confronting the racist actions and hate speech of these cowards with our own speech and protest.\n\nJabari Jones of the People of Color Caucus in Burlington put out a call to action over social media on February 9, after receiving word that the fascists were planning a demonstration in the high-visibility Staples parking lot next to the highway.\n\nThe International Socialist Organization at UVM organized a student march from the university down to the shopping center. Black Rose/Rosa Negra Burlington and the Peace and Justice Center also put out a call to action, and many other groups mobilized to join the action.\n\nCommunity members already at the shopping center cheered loudly as they were joined by students marching down Williston Road, chanting \"No hate, no fear immigrants are welcome here!\" and \"No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA!\" There were no obvious signs of any members of Patriot Front.\n\nAMONG THE counterprotesters who occupied the sidewalk, shouting chants into the streets, was 21 year-old Drew Baker, a student at the University of Vermont. \"I'm here today because a certain group of folks decided to wake up this morning and spread hate,\" he said. \"In response to that, an even larger group of people decided to wake up and stand in solidarity.\"\n\nMary Robideau, also a UVM student, spoke of the scarring experience she had last fall while protesting fascists in Charlottesville, Virginia, where social justice activist Heather Heyer was killed. \"That kind of put me off of activism for a little bit, honestly,\" she said, explaining her need to take time to recover. \"But I decided that these white supremacist movements have to be squashed.\"\n\nThe next day, the Burlington Free Press reported that a handful of Patriot Front cowards avoided the confrontation at their planned rally site and crossed town to City Hall park to wave their banners on the corner, where they were shouted down by a \"couple of kids\" and were gone in about 10 minutes.\n\nA video posted on Patriot Front's Twitter page was apparently taken down after someone pointed out that their license plate was visible.\n\nThe news that neo-Nazis did rally in our city was met with anger and sadness over social media by many of the people who came out to confront them on Saturday. This is understandable, but we shouldn't miss the point that the counterdemonstration of hundreds forced them away from their intended location.\n\nBecause Staples Plaza is close to a highway overpass, many counterdemonstrators believed Patriot Front was planning to hang racist banners from the overpass\u2014one of its favorite tactics. Instead, the racists were forced to turn tail and hold a pathetic rally, where they were shouted down by youth.\n\nThe lesson for anti-racists in Burlington is clear: Don't wait! Organize against hate immediately. When racist posters go up, we must unite and take action to show people in targeted communities that people have their back\u2014and show the fascists that they are the ones who are isolated."}, "https://socialistworker.org/2016/11/16/colin-kaepernicks-right-to-not-vote": {"title": "Colin Kaepernick's right to not vote", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://socialistworker.org/2016/11/16/colin-kaepernicks-right-to-not-vote", "text": "THERE IS one pledge I'm making after this election: For my mental, physical and especially political health, I'm done ingesting bullshit. I'm done with the hot-take bloviating culture--in sports and politics--that, as Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said, bears as much accountability for the absurdity of Donald Trump's being president as anything else.\n\nA great example of this could be seen in the response to Colin Kaepernick's comments about the election. For those who missed it, the anthem-protesting 49ers quarterback said he wasn't voting, explaining it this way: \"I've been very disconnected from the systematic oppression as a whole. So, for me, it's another face that's going to be the face of that system of oppression. To me, it didn't really matter who went in there. The system still remains intact that oppresses people of color.\"\n\nPeople might not like the fact that Kaep chose not to vote, but he was hardly alone. Hillary Clinton won almost 10 million fewer votes than Barack Obama in 2008. Hell, Donald Trump got 1.5 million fewer votes than Mitt Romney. People stayed home in record numbers because this election season was nauseating. They stayed home because the number-one issue according to all the polls was the economy, but the media, and for the most part the candidates, spent a year and a half talking about bullshit. We spent 18 precious months of our lives discussing polls and haircuts and e-mails and pantsuits and tweets. We didn't talk--at least not after Bernie Sanders was vanquished by the DNC--about how this economy has flattened working people and people of color for 40 years and what the nominees were going to do about it.\n\nI'm far less angry at Colin Kaepernick for not voting than I am at the Democratic Party for taking away the choice that we deserved to make: a choice between--as one protester in D.C. said so well--whether we would have a white nationalist/scapegoating economy or whether we would have a social economy. That's not just about Bernie. It's about Senator Elizabeth Warren's choosing not to run. It's about coronating someone from the neoliberal wing of the party just because it was her turn. The Democrats did not give us that choice, so now we're going have to fight for it. There are demonstrations ripping out across the country, and the one called for inauguration weekend is going to be a doozy. I have been in three demonstrations in D.C. in the last week. A young person at one of these demos said to me: \"I couldn't stop thinking about Trump winning. I was at work, and I couldn't stop crying. It's not about Hillary Clinton. It's about the Democratic machine and the way they ran their candidate of choice through the system. So we see that the liberal elites were just as out of touch as we have known.\"\n\nMEDIA SCOLDS invariably say in their most hectoring tones that so many people died for our right to vote and to not exercise it is a slap in the face to their sacrifice. I think the slap in the face to their sacrifice is having our choices limited to candidates who don't represent the pressing questions we face in our lives. It's a slap in the face to their sacrifice that we have an Electoral College\u2013a relic designed to give disproportionate power to slave states--that put the person with the lesser number of votes in office. It's a slap in the face that we have a voting system that effectively put a poll tax on people of color with four-hour lines and limited hours.\n\nI understand where Colin Kaepernick is coming from, and I respect all he has done this year to raise awareness about police violence and putting that question in uncomfortable spaces. It has taken courage in the face of threats to his career and threats to his life.\n\nESPN's Stephen A. Smith, however, disagrees. This is what he says:\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Colin Kaepernick is absolutely irrelevant. I don't want to see him again, I don't want hear from him again, I don't want to hear a [darn] word about anything he has to say about our nation...He comes across as a flaming hypocrite...After all this noise that you made, even though you didn't intended to do so, by offending our military service men and women, and pointing out about how you wanted to bring attention to racial injustices and beyond in this country, to turn around and not even take your behind to the polls to vote for a particular candidate, it is shameful! Absolutely shameful! For him not to vote, as far as I'm concerned, everything he said meant absolutely nothing.\n\nMy only comment about this carnival barker's political wheeze is what I said at the start. I'm done ingesting this kind of bullshit. It's bad for my health and makes a mockery of the very real, very tough choices that we are going to face in the years ahead. Let the pundits in sports and talk radio yell at each other until they're blue in the face. If we have learned nothing else this election season, it's that none of it means a goddamn thing. In my life at least, their existence is officially on mute. We should treat them as something even less important than the lonely tree that falls in the forest.

They deserve that. But they have to be ready to exert the power they have by walking out of their schools if they do not get what they want. They have to exert the reputational power that 3 million of our most admired voters have.

I've just had enough.\"\n\nA web page calling for pledges to commit to an April 20 action and sponsored by the Network for Public Education, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, and other organizations says, \"The failure to enact rational laws around the purchase of guns that are designed for mass shootings is inexcusable. The time to act is now. Every child deserves to learn in a school that is safe.\"\n\nA separate nationwide walkout event sponsored by organizers of the Women's March is scheduled for March 14. Rather than a day-long event, that action is scheduled to take place \"for 17 minutes at 10am across every time zone ... to protest Congress' inaction to do more than tweet thoughts and prayers in response to the gun violence plaguing our schools and neighborhoods.\"\n\nOn Twitter the National School Walkout explains, \"For those of you concerned on the separate dates of our protest and @womensmarch 's. We agree that there is strength in numbers. That is why we have contacted them and are waiting for their response. We all would prefer a full day to 17 minutes.\"\n\nAmong the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School countering lawmakers' vacuous \"thoughts and prayers\" and instead making passionate pleas for action on gun legislation in the wake of the Parkland shooting is 17-year-old David Hogg.\n\n\"I don't want this to be another mass shooting. I want this to be the last mass shooting,\" the senior told MSNBC. \"Everybody is getting used to this, and that's not ok. ... We're habituating to this. And what happens when you do that is children are dying and they will continue to die unless we stop it, stand up, and take action.\"\n\n\"We don't need ideas.

The didn't like him organizing a Poor People's Campaign to try to bring together economically exploited people of all races. And they certainly didn't like him showing up in Memphis to help sanitation workers strike for better working conditions after two of their own, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, were killed on the job.\n\nWriting for The Intercept on Monday, Zaid Jilani points to a notable shift in public opinion polling before and decades after King's death; in 1966, 63 percent of Americans held a negative view of him, but by 1999, King was ranked second, behind Mother Theresa, on a list of the most admired figures of the 20th century. King had been more widely accepted in the early 1960s, but his popularity declined with his decisions to publicly denounce the Vietnam War and launch more provocative anti-poverty initaitves.\n\n\"He labeled the war an 'enemy of the poor,' saying that its budget was draining anti-poverty programs; he also pointed out that it was hypocritical for him to preach nonviolence to activists at home, while watching his government reject that principle abroad,\" Jilani writes. \"The backlash from a liberal establishment that had once praised King for his civil rights campaign came as hard and fast,\" as did that of the African-American establishment and 168 newspaper editorial boards nationwide.\n\nHowever, after King was killed in April of 1968, \"the mood shifted quickly,\" Jilani notes. Former President Lyndon B.

That is, after all, what they were created to do. If only the normal, decent relations between the police and the community could be re-established, this problem could be resolved. Poor people in general are more likely to be the victims of crime than anyone else, this reasoning goes, and in that way, they are in more need than anyone else of police protection. Maybe there are a few bad apples, but if only the police weren\u2019t so racist, or didn\u2019t carry out policies like stop-and-frisk, or weren\u2019t so afraid of black people, or shot fewer unarmed men, they could function as a useful service that we all need.\n\nThis liberal way of viewing the problem rests on a misunderstanding of the origins of the police and what they were created to do. The police were not created to protect and serve the population. They were not created to stop crime, at least not as most people understand it. And they were certainly not created to promote justice. They were created to protect the new form of wage-labor capitalism that emerged in the mid to late nineteenth century from the threat posed by that system\u2019s offspring, the working class.\n\nThis is a blunt way of stating a nuanced truth, but sometimes nuance just serves to obfuscate.\n\nBefore the nineteenth century, there were no police forces that we would recognize as such anywhere in the world. In the Northern United States, there was a system of elected constables and sheriffs, much more responsible to the population in a very direct way than the police are today. In the South, the closest thing to a police force was the slave patrols. Then, as Northern cities grew and filled with mostly immigrant wage workers who were physically and socially separated from the ruling class, the wealthy elite who ran the various municipal governments hired hundreds and then thousands of armed men to impose order on the new working class neighborhoods.\n\nClass conflict roiled late nineteenth century American cities like Chicago, which experienced major strikes and riots in 1867, 1877, 1886, and 1894. In each of these upheavals, the police attacked strikers with extreme violence, even if in 1877 and 1894 the U.S. Army played a bigger role in ultimately repressing the working class. In the aftermath of these movements, the police increasingly presented themselves as a thin blue line protecting civilization, by which they meant bourgeois civilization, from the disorder of the working class. This ideology of order that developed in the late nineteenth century echoes down to today \u2013 except that today, poor black and Latino people are the main threat, rather than immigrant workers.\n\nOf course, the ruling class did not get everything it wanted, and had to yield on many points to the immigrant workers it sought to control. This is why, for instance, municipal governments backed away from trying to stop Sunday drinking, and why they hired so many immigrant police officers, especially the Irish. But despite these concessions, businessmen organized themselves to make sure the police were increasingly isolated from democratic control, and established their own hierarchies, systems of governance, and rules of behavior. The police increasingly set themselves off from the population by donning uniforms, establishing their own rules for hiring, promotion, and firing, working to build a unique esprit des corps, and identifying themselves with order. And despite complaints about corruption and inefficiency, they gained more and more support from the ruling class, to the extent that in Chicago, for instance, businessmen donated money to buy the police rifles, artillery, Gatling guns, buildings, and money to establish a police pension out of their own pockets.\n\nThere was a never a time when the big city police neutrally enforced \u201cthe law,\u201d or came anywhere close to that ideal (for that matter, the law itself has never been neutral). In the North, they mostly arrested people for the vaguely defined \u201ccrimes\u201d of disorderly conduct and vagrancy throughout the nineteenth century. This meant that the police could arrest anyone they saw as a threat to \u201corder.\u201d In the post-bellum South, they enforced white supremacy and largely arrested black people on trumped-up charges in order to feed them into convict labor systems.\n\nThe violence the police carried out and their moral separation from those they patrolled were not the consequences of the brutality of individual officers, but were the consequences of careful policies designed to mold the police into a force that could use violence to deal with the social problems that accompanied the development of a wage-labor economy. For instance, in the short, sharp depression of the mid 1880s, Chicago was filled with prostitutes who worked the streets. Many policemen recognized that these prostitutes were generally impoverished women seeking a way to survive, and initially tolerated their behavior. But the police hierarchy insisted that the patrolmen do their duty whatever their feelings, and arrest these women, impose fines, and drive them off the streets and into brothels, where they could be ignored by some members of the elite and controlled by others. Similarly, in 1885, when Chicago began to experience a wave of strikes, some policemen sympathized with strikers. But once the police hierarchy and the mayor decided to break the strikes, policemen who refused to comply were fired. In these and a thousand similar ways, the police were molded into a force that would impose order on working class and poor people, whatever the individual feelings of the officers involved.\n\nThough some patrolmen tried to be kind and others were openly brutal, police violence in the 1880s was not a case of a few bad apples \u2013 and neither is it today.\n\nMuch has changed since the creation of the police \u2013 most importantly the influx of black people into the Northern cities, the mid-twentieth century black movement, and the creation of the current system of mass incarceration in part as a response to that movement. But these changes did not lead to a fundamental shift in policing. They led to new policies designed to preserve fundamental continuities. The police were created to use violence to reconcile electoral democracy with industrial capitalism. Today, they are just one part of the \u201ccriminal justice\u201d system which continues to play the same role. Their basic job is to enforce order among those with the most reason to resent the system \u2013 who in our society today are disproportionately poor black people.\n\nA democratic police system is imaginable \u2013 one in which police are elected by and accountable to the people they patrol. But that is not what we have. And it\u2019s not what the current system of policing was created to be.\n\nIf there is one positive lesson from the history of policing\u2019s origins, it is that when workers organized, refused to submit or cooperate, and caused problems for the city governments, they could back the police off from the most galling of their activities. Murdering individual police officers, as happened in in Chicago on May 3rd 1886 and more recently in New York on December 20th, 2014, only reinforced those calling for harsh repression \u2013 a reaction we are beginning to see already. But resistance on a mass scale could force the police to hesitate. This happened in Chicago during the early 1880s, when the police pulled back from breaking strikes, hired immigrant officers, and tried to re-establish some credibility among the working class after their role in brutally crushing the 1877 upheaval.\n\nThe police might be backed off again if the reaction against the killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, and countless others continues. If they are, it will be a victory for those mobilizing today, and will save lives \u2013 though as long as this system that requires police violence to control a big share of its population survives, any change in police policy will be aimed at keeping the poor in line more effectively.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t expect the police to be something they\u2019re not. As historians, we ought to know that origins matter, and the police were created by the ruling class to control working class and poor people, not help them. They\u2019ve continued to play that role ever since."}, "http://www.newsweek.com/billionaires-money-end-poverty-report-786675": {"title": "Billionaires made enough money in 2017 to end extreme poverty around the world seven times over, report says", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/billionaires-money-end-poverty-report-786675", "text": "Last year, the world\u2019s billionaires made over $462 billion combined\u2014enough money to end extreme poverty around the globe seven times over.

And employees say the retailer's method of ensuring compliance is crushing morale.\n\nThe new system, called order-to-shelf, or OTS, has a strict set of procedures for purchasing, displaying, and storing products on store shelves and in back rooms. To make sure stores comply, Whole Foods relies on \"scorecards\" that evaluate everything from the accuracy of signage to the proper recording of theft, or \"shrink.\"\n\nSome employees, who walk through stores with managers to ensure compliance, describe the system as onerous and stress-inducing. Conversations with 27 current and recently departed Whole Foods workers, including cashiers and corporate employees \u2014 some of whom have been with the company for nearly two decades \u2014 say the system is seen by many as punitive.\n\nThey say many employees are terrified of losing their jobs under the new system and that they spend more hours mired in OTS-related paperwork than helping customers. Some are so fed up with the new system that they have quit or are looking for other jobs. In addition to hurting morale, OTS has led to food shortages across Whole Foods stores, they say.\n\nOn calls with investors, Whole Foods executives have said that OTS has helped cut costs, reduce shrink, clear out storage, and enable employees to spend more time engaging with customers. And employees, as well as outsiders, have said that the company's decentralized system was inefficient and needed a change.\n\nBut the new system goes too far, according to the employees who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"The OTS program is leading to sackings up and down the chain in our region,\" said an employee of a Georgia Whole Foods. \"We've lost team leaders, store team leaders, executive coordinators and even a regional vice president. Many of them have left because they consider OTS to be absurd. As an example, store team leaders are required to complete a 108-point checklist for OTS.\"\n\nAll the employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Whole Foods did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nWhole Foods enforces compliance with OTS by instructing managers to regularly walk through store aisles and storage rooms with checklists called \"scorecards\" to make sure every item is in its right place, according to nearly 80 pages of internal company documents reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nIf anything is amiss or there is too much excess stock in storage, departments lose points on their scorecards.\n\n\"Every item in our department has a designated spot that is labeled or marked,\" an employee of a Colorado Whole Foods store said. \"If that item is even an inch outside of its designated spot ... we receive negative marks.\"\n\nThe walks also involve on-the-spot quizzes, in which employees are asked to recite their departments' sales goals, top-selling items, previous week's sales, and other information.\n\nFailing scores \u2014 which qualify as anything below 89.9% \u2014 can result in firings, employees said.\n\nStore managers conduct these tests, internally referred to as \"walks,\" twice weekly, according to the company documents. Corporate employees from Whole Foods' regional offices also carry out walks once monthly, and ultimately stores must pass a walk conducted by executives from Whole Foods' global headquarters, in Austin, Texas.\n\nEmployees who spoke with Business Insider said the walks have instilled fear across every department of Whole Foods' stores.\n\n\"I wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares about maps and inventory, and when regional leadership is going to come in and see one thing wrong, and fail the team,\" a supervisor at a West Coast Whole Foods said. \"The stress has created such a tense working environment. Seeing someone cry at work is becoming normal.\"\n\nThe maps this employee referenced are diagrams drawn up by Whole Foods' corporate office that dictate where every item in the store should be placed.\n\n\"The fear of chastisement, punishment, and retribution is very real and pervasive,\" another worker said.\n\nEmployees, suppliers, and industry analysts have said that Whole Foods' old system of managing inventory before OTS was highly inefficient and needed to be updated.\n\n\"Whole Foods had a very decentralized approach, which adds complexity, and complexity adds cost,\" said Jim Holbrook, CEO of private label and retail consultancy Daymon Worldwide, which recently started working with Whole Foods.\n\nUnder Whole Foods' old purchasing system, buyers at the store and regional levels had more power to decide what to sell in their stores. With OTS, Whole Foods' corporate office in Austin is making more of those decisions. This approach is bringing Whole Foods' business model more in line with those at conventional supermarkets like Kroger and Safeway.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this business model \u2014 and OTS \u2014 will work for Whole Foods. Holbrook believes it will. He said Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods last year for $13.7 billion, would be able to help Whole Foods work out the kinks with OTS.\n\n\"Amazon is very good at managing logistics behind the scenes,\" Holbrook said. \"Whole Foods will be a better shopping experience as a result.\"\n\nMany employees are also hopeful that Amazon will fix the new system.\n\n\"We all just hope that Amazon will walk into some stores and see all the holes on the shelf,\" a 12-year employee of a Midwest Whole Foods said.\n\nWhole Foods says order-to-shelf gives employees more time to engage with customers.\n\n\"The team members are really excited about\" order-to-shelf, Whole Foods executive vice president of operations David Lannon said last year on a call with investors. \"They're really proud when they're able to achieve that, which is lower out-of-stocks, less inventory in the store, being able to be on the sales floor talking to customers and selling more products.\"\n\nSeveral store employees balked at that claim. \"On my most recent time card, I clocked over 10 hours of overtime, sitting at a desk doing OTS work,\" a supervisor at a West Coast Whole Foods said. \"Rather than focusing on guest service, I've had team members cleaning facial-care testers and facing the shelves, so that everything looks perfect and untouched at all times.\"\n\nSome employees said recent labor cuts have made it difficult to keep up with the demands of OTS. \"It's running everyone into the ground and they absolutely hate it,\" a high-level employee of a Midwest Whole Foods said.\n\nMany Whole Foods employees at the corporate and store levels still don't understand how OTS works, employees said.\n\n\"OTS has confused so many smart, logical, and experienced individuals, the befuddlement is now a thing, a life all its own,\" an employee of a Chicago-area store said. \"It's a collective confusion \u2014 constantly changing, no clear answers to the questions that never were, until now.\"\n\nAn employee of a North Carolina Whole Foods said: \"No one really knows this business model, and those who are doing the scorecards \u2014 even regional leadership \u2014 are not clear on practices and consequently are constantly providing the department leaders with inaccurate directions. All this comes at a time when labor has been reduced to an unachievable level given the requirements of the OTS model.\"\n\nTwo recently departed employees specifically cited lack of training as a key reason why OTS is, in their view, failing.\n\n\"The problem lies in lack of training and the fact that every single member of management from store level to corporate is over tasked and overburdened,\" said one former corporate employee who was in charge of conducting walks at stores on the East Coast.\n\nOthers said it appeared that whoever wrote the program had no experience working in stores.\n\n\"In the beginning, we actually had a checklist where one task was to initial that you initialed off another task,\" said one employee who was involved in OTS training at several East Coast stores. She said that duty was quickly dropped, but that it was emblematic of how the implementation of OTS has gone.\n\n\"The 'nano' management is downright insane,\" she said.\n\nIf you work for Whole Foods and have information to share, email hpeterson@businessinsider.com."}, "https://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/11/13/white-nationalist-who-hates-jews-will-be-trumps-right-hand-man-white-house/214419": {"title": "A White Nationalist Who Hates Jews Will Be Trump's Right-Hand Man In The White House", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/11/13/white-nationalist-who-hates-jews-will-be-trumps-right-hand-man-white-house/214419", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first White House hire tells you everything you need to know about his commitment to his campaign\u2019s bigoted message. Stephen Bannon, an anti-Semite who ran the white nationalist \u201calt-right\u201d website Breitbart News before taking a leave of absence to become the Trump campaign CEO, will be Trump\u2019s chief strategist and senior counselor.\n\nOn November 13, Trump released a statement announcing Bannon\u2019s hiring. The same statement noted that Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus would become Trump\u2019s chief of staff. While White House chief of staff is typically the most senior position in the White House, the press release named Bannon first and described the two as \u201cequal partners\u201d in the Trump administration.\n\nBannon has been a key figure in leveraging this bigotry to aid Trump\u2019s rise to power. Bannon bragged during the Republican Convention to nominate Trump that Breitbart News had become home to the \u201calt-right\u201d -- which is just a racist code word for white nationalists. Under Bannon\u2019s leadership, Breitbart News has featured racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, and anti-LGBT rhetoric. The site recently made a \u201cnoticeable shift toward embracing ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right. Racist ideas. Anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant ideas -- all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the \u2018Alt-Right\u2019\u201d according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Before he died, Andrew Breitbart himself reportedly called Bannon \u201cthe Leni Riefenstahl of the tea party movement.\u201d\n\nBannon\u2019s Breitbart News especially has come under fire for its rampant anti-Semitism. In May, contributor David Horowitz wrote a piece calling The Weekly Standard\u2019s Bill Kristol a \u201crenegade Jew.\u201d In September, Breitbart News writer Matthew Tyrmand called Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum a \u201cpolitical revisionist\u201d who was \u201con the warpath against the rising populist forces doing electoral damage to her establishment friends and allies across the world,\u201d adding, \u201chell hath no fury like a Polish, Jewish, American elitist scorned.\u201d In August, former Breitbart News writer Ben Shapiro accused the website of embracing \u201ca movement shot through with racism and anti-Semitism.\u201d Bannon\u2019s anti-Semitism goes deeper than just Breitbart. As CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper noted on Twitter after today\u2019s announcement, Bannon\u2019s ex-wife swore in court that \u201che said he doesn\u2019t like Jews\u201d and didn\u2019t want his children to go to school with Jews. Indeed, Esquire politics contributor Charles Pierce even compared Bannon with David Duke\n\nThere are also significant issues with how Bannon ran Breitbart News. Breitbart News staffers alleged that Trump -- with the cooperation of Bannon and other top management -- paid the website for favorable news coverage and to turn it into \u201chis own fan website.\u201d Former spokesman Kurt Bardella told Media Matters that Bannon is a \u201c\u201cpathological liar who has a temperament that governs by bullying and intimidation and functions very much like a dictator at Breitbart.\u201d\n\nRecently, Bannon has characterized the rise of Trump as part of a global nationalist movement, telling the radio show Breitbart News Daily on November 2, that \u201cpeople want more control of their country. \u2026 They want sovereignty. It\u2019s not just a thing that\u2019s happening in any one geographic space.\u201d His website has promoted Trump-style far-right political parties across Europe. In the past week, Bannon has reached out to France\u2019s right-wing Nationalist Front movement, and according to The Daily Beast, he is \u201cright now the direct line between the European far-right and Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nThe hires of Bannon and Priebus together signal that Trump\u2019s White House will combine the traditional Republicanism of Priebus with Bannon\u2019s brand of ethno-nationalism. Prominent Republican figures like Speaker Paul Ryan are signaling that they will allow the normalization of such a figure, openly praising Priebus\u2019 hiring while ignoring Bannon rather than speaking out against him. Just today on CNN, Paul Ryan said he had never met Bannon, had no comment on him serving in Trump\u2019s White House, but declared that he \u201ctrusted\u201d Trump. Ryan\u2019s agnosticism about Bannon beggars belief: Breitbart News under Bannon had led a multi-year campaign against Ryan, including declaring Ryan a Clinton supporter who shares her \u201cglobalist worldview\u201d just weeks ago.\n\nLess than a week after Trump\u2019s electoral victory, many reporters still seem confused about just what will come from a Trump administration. If they want to know what Trump truly has in mind for the country, they need to look at Bannon and his bigoted website."}, "http://www.evonomics.com/capitalism-medieval-peasants-got-vacation-time-heres/": {"title": "Before Capitalism, Medieval Peasants Got More Vacation Time Than You. Here's Why.", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.evonomics.com/capitalism-medieval-peasants-got-vacation-time-heres/", "text": "Life for the medieval peasant was certainly no picnic. His life was shadowed by fear of famine, disease and bursts of warfare. His diet and personal hygiene left much to be desired. But despite his reputation as a miserable wretch, you might envy him one thing: his vacations.\n\nPlowing and harvesting were backbreaking toil, but the peasant enjoyed anywhere from eight weeks to half the year off. The Church, mindful of how to keep a population from rebelling, enforced frequent mandatory holidays. Weddings, wakes and births might mean a week off quaffing ale to celebrate, and when wandering jugglers or sporting events came to town, the peasant expected time off for entertainment. There were labor-free Sundays, and when the plowing and harvesting seasons were over, the peasant got time to rest, too. In fact, economist Juliet Shor found that during periods of particularly high wages, such as 14th-century England, peasants might put in no more than 150 days a year.\n\nGet Evonomics in your inbox\n\nAs for the modern American worker? After a year on the job, she gets an average of eight vacation days annually.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to turn out this way: John Maynard Keynes, one of the founders of modern economics, made a famous prediction that by 2030, advanced societies would be wealthy enough that leisure time, rather than work, would characterize national lifestyles. So far, that forecast is not looking good.\n\nWhat happened? Some cite the victory of the modern eight-hour a day, 40-hour workweek over the punishing 70 or 80 hours a 19th century worker spent toiling as proof that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. But Americans have long since kissed the 40-hour workweek goodbye, and Shor\u2019s examination of work patterns reveals that the 19th century was an aberration in the history of human labor. When workers fought for the eight-hour workday, they weren\u2019t trying to get something radical and new, but rather to restore what their ancestors had enjoyed before industrial capitalists and the electric lightbulb came on the scene. Go back 200, 300 or 400 years and you find that most people did not work very long hours at all. In addition to relaxing during long holidays, the medieval peasant took his sweet time eating meals, and the day often included time for an afternoon snooze. \u201cThe tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed,\u201d notes Shor. \u201cOur ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to the 21st century, and the U.S. is the only advanced country with no national vacation policy whatsoever. Many American workers must keep on working through public holidays, and vacation days often go unused. Even when we finally carve out a holiday, many of us answer emails and \u201ccheck in\u201d whether we\u2019re camping with the kids or trying to kick back on the beach.\n\nSome blame the American worker for not taking what is her due. But in a period of consistently high unemployment, job insecurity and weak labor unions, employees may feel no choice but to accept the conditions set by the culture and the individual employer. In a world of \u201cat will\u201d employment, where the work contract can be terminated at any time, it\u2019s not easy to raise objections.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the New Deal brought back some of the conditions that farm workers and artisans from the Middle Ages took for granted, but since the 1980s things have gone steadily downhill. With secure long-term employment slipping away, people jump from job to job, so seniority no longer offers the benefits of additional days off. The rising trend of hourly and part-time work, stoked by the Great Recession, means that for many, the idea of a guaranteed vacation is a dim memory.\n\nIronically, this cult of endless toil doesn\u2019t really help the bottom line. Study after study shows that overworking reduces productivity. On the other hand, performance increases after a vacation, and workers come back with restored energy and focus. The longer the vacation, the more relaxed and energized people feel upon returning to the office.\n\nEconomic crises give austerity-minded politicians excuses to talk of decreasing time off, increasing the retirement age and cutting into social insurance programs and safety nets that were supposed to allow us a fate better than working until we drop. In Europe, where workers average 25 to 30 days off per year, politicians like French President Francois Hollande and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras are sending signals that the culture of longer vacations is coming to an end. But the belief that shorter vacations bring economic gains doesn\u2019t appear to add up. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the Greeks, who face a horrible economy, work more hours than any other Europeans. In Germany, an economic powerhouse, workers rank second to last in number of hours worked. Despite more time off, German workers are the eighth most productive in Europe, while the long-toiling Greeks rank 24 out of 25 in productivity.\n\nBeyond burnout, vanishing vacations make our relationships with families and friends suffer. Our health is deteriorating: depression and higher risk of death are among the outcomes for our no-vacation nation. Some forward-thinking people have tried to reverse this trend, like progressive economist Robert Reich, who has argued in favor of a mandatory three weeks off for all American workers. Congressman Alan Grayson proposed the Paid Vacation Act of 2009, but alas, the bill didn\u2019t even make it to the floor of Congress.\n\nSpeaking of Congress, its members seem to be the only people in America getting as much down time as the medieval peasant. They get 239 days off this year."}, "https://www.change.org/p/russia-prosecutor-general-investigate-mass-murder-and-torture-of-lgbt-people-in-chechnya/u/20243948?utm_medium=email&utm_source=69773&utm_campaign=petition_update&sfmc_tk=EjRXsgnoeYZY8XVJ8t%2FywVR7hK5gE1ipIRsudZ9LrkaiyF4pW8nZMrKsCYB71QPd": {"title": "We were just detained as we tried to deliver 400K signatures supporting gay men in Chechnya", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.change.org/p/russia-prosecutor-general-investigate-mass-murder-and-torture-of-lgbt-people-in-chechnya/u/20243948?utm_medium=email&utm_source=69773&utm_campaign=petition_update&sfmc_tk=EjRXsgnoeYZY8XVJ8t%2FywVR7hK5gE1ipIRsudZ9LrkaiyF4pW8nZMrKsCYB71QPd", "text": "Hi there!

The killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Walter Scott have increased the world\u2019s attention to US police violence, yet most Americans underestimate the threat posed by the people charged with keeping them safe.\n\nThere is no national registry of civilians killed by police and corrections officers in the United States. Several states, including Texas, Connecticut and California, maintain complete records, but in most parts of the United States, local law enforcement chooses whether to report officer-involved homicides to the federal government. The lack of systematic data poses a challenge both for those who wish to hold police accountable for their actions and for those who want to propose reform measures to reduce police violence. How many killings are committed by police?\n\nIn recent months, a number of \u2018crowdsourced\u2019 databases have emerged, including in particular Fatal Encounters and Killed by Police.[3] Journalistic efforts, including those by the Washington Post and the Guardian, have conducted infographic-style analyses of the patterns of police homicides that are known to the public. This latter qualification is a big one.\n\nFor the past twenty-five years, my colleagues and I have documented mass killings by state agents in over thirty countries around the world. From El Salvador to South Africa, from Kosovo to East Timor, from Colombia to Congo, we have built databases and conducted statistical analyses of patterns of violence by governments on behalf of tribunals, truth commissions, UN human rights missions and for local human rights activists. One of the only constants across all these examples is that the data we are able to collect is always partial.[4]\n\nIt is difficult to collect information about violence committed by governments. Victims are afraid of retaliation and so they explain the deaths in other ways. The families of victims rightly recognize that to accuse a police or military officer of murder puts themselves and their family members directly in the path of well-resourced and sometimes violent adversaries who may be above the law.\n\nFurthermore, state agents who commit mass violence make every effort to disguise their actions. They influence coroners to describe the killings as accidents. They create narratives that distort responsibility so that it seems as though the victim is at fault for his or her own death. In their own narratives, police and military officials are keeping the peace and protecting innocents from the violent, the rebellious and the criminal. And in many cases, these narratives are correct. After all, the reason we consent to the existence of armed forces in our midst is precisely to keep us safe from these threats.\n\nIn other incidents, however, the police have killed people by accident, or because they used excessive force, or because their rules of engagement permit them to use deadly force whenever they feel their lives are threatened, for any reason. The question Americans face is therefore at what point the violence committed by our protectors exceeds the violence we might suffer from the people they claim to be protecting us against?\n\nThe FBI maintains a list of homicides called the Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR), which includes people killed by police and corrections officers. Crucially, the SHR only includes homicides committed by police that in the judgment of the police department or the local FBI have been justified, that is, considered legal. Many people, including members of Congress, have asked the larger question: How many people in total are killed by the police in the United States every year?\n\nSeeking an answer, Congress passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000, requiring the Department of Justice to maintain a list of people killed by police in the United States. The Arrest-Related Deaths program (ARD) was created by the Bureau of Justice Statistics to do this. After several years, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) decided to conduct an assessment of the coverage of the Arrest-Related Deaths database. Was this database complete, or did it omit victims?\n\nThe BJS faced the same problem looking at the victims of police homicides in the United States that the global human rights community faces when we try to figure out how many people have been killed in Syria\u2019s civil war: we have a number of lists which partially overlap, and which are individually and in sum incomplete. It turns out that there is a statistical technique specifically designed for data of this kind \u2013 using multiple, independently collected lists \u2013 that can create good estimates of how many people are not on the lists.\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics turned to Research Triangle Incorporated, a North Carolina-based statistics think tank, for help with this statistical evaluation. They issued a report published in March 2015 that compared the Arrest-Related Deaths database with the FBI\u2019s Supplementary Homicide Report.[5] The report considers homicides committed by police within the years 2003\u20132009 and 2011 (2010 was omitted). They first asked how much the two databases overlap, that is, how often they document the same victims.\n\nThe left circle shows the number of deaths documented in the Arrest-Related Deaths database, and the right circle shows the deaths documented by the Supplementary Homicide Report. The overlapping section in the middle \u2013 the intersection of the two lists \u2013 shows the number of deaths on both lists.\n\nNotice that in the Venn diagram, the two lists are encircled by a large cloud of smoke \u2013 think of this as the \u2018universe\u2019 of total deaths, which includes the deaths that are not on the ARD or SHR lists.[6] That is, the cloud includes deaths that are not observed by these projects. We can use some probability theory and algebra to estimate the number of deaths not on the lists, and this is an important insight. The cloud refers to the total number of police homicides that can be \u2018statistically inferred\u2019 to exist.\n\nHere is an analogy for how this statistical technique works. Imagine that there are two rooms, and we want to know which of the two is larger. Our only tool for assessing the rooms\u2019 sizes is a handful of small rubber balls. The balls have the curious property that when they strike each other, they make a distinctive clicking noise. We take the rubber balls, throw them into the first room and listen \u2013 click, click, click. Then we gather the balls and throw them into the second room \u2013 click. Which room is larger?\n\nThe second room is larger. The smaller room forces the balls together more closely than the larger room, so the balls have less room to bounce around, and they therefore hit each other more often.\n\nWhat the BJS analysts have done in their report is akin to throwing the two databases into the \u2018room\u2019 of all police homicides in the United States. It turns out that the ratio of the sizes of the individual databases to the number of times they collide can provide an estimate of the total number of police homicides in the US \u2013 including those that have not been observed.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the real purpose of statistics. We often use simple statistics that just count things, like how many widgets our factory shipped last year. But statistics is much more useful when it enables us to know something about uncertainty. If we have a measure that we know to be imprecise, how imprecise is it: wildly, or only slightly? If we have a measure that systematically undercounts something (statisticians would call this bias), is the undercount minimal, or is it severe? Can we correct the bias? These are the kinds of questions that statistics can answer. In this case, the estimate made by the Bureau of Justice Statistics is much closer to the likely true number of homicides committed by police than the raw data, but it can be improved considerably. To understand how this works, let\u2019s dive into the technical bits.\n\nHere\u2019s the math behind measuring undocumented police homicides: there is a total number of homicides committed by police in the United States, denoted by an uppercase N. The uppercase N represents all the deaths in the cloud, but we don\u2019t know what it is. What we do know is the number of deaths listed, documented, and known in the Arrest-Related Deaths database \u2013 call this number A; the list of deaths documented and known by the FBI in the Supplementary Homicide Report \u2013 call this B; and the number of deaths known in both databases \u2013 we\u2019ll call this M. The probability that any given death in N is documented by the Arrest-Related Deaths database is A divided by N; that a death in N is documented by the FBI\u2019s Supplementary Homicide Report is B divided by N; and that a death is documented by these two lists, M divided by N.\n\nBut here\u2019s where we can really get some leverage. Let\u2019s think about tossing coins: with one coin, the probability of a flip coming up heads is one over two. If I flip two coins, the probability that I\u2019ve thrown two heads is one over four, that is, it equals the probability of the first head multiplied by the probability of the second head.\n\nApplying this logic to the lists is essentially the same. Remember that we know the number of people on both lists (M), so the probability of being documented by both lists is M/N. As with the probability of two heads in a coin toss, this probability is also equal to the probability of being on the first list (which we defined as A/N) multiplied by the probability of being on the second list (which is B/N).\n\nFrom this, we can say that M/N = A/N B/N. This is an equation with one unknown, N, because we know A, B and M; that means we can solve for N. Our best estimate of N \u2013 the total universe of homicides \u2013 is therefore AB/M, or the number of victims listed in the Arrest-Related Deaths database multiplied by the number of victims listed in the Supplementary Homicide Report divided by the number of victims recorded in both.\n\nThis is one way that statistics illuminates uncertainty: it provides a model based in probability theory to tell us what we don\u2019t know. This is what the Bureau of Justice Statistics analysts have done to estimate the total number of police homicides as 7,427. That is, they estimate that in addition to the homicides documented by the Arrest-Related Deaths database and the Supplemental Homicide Report, an additional 2,103 victims were killed by police in the United States during the period 2003 through 2009 and 2011 (excluding 2010).\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics released their report in March 2015, and it created a media tizzy. Pundits and politicians were reminded that even the federal government doesn\u2019t know how many people in America are killed by police. It was a striking admission of the weakness of the federal bureaucracy with respect to recalcitrant local law enforcement officials who refuse to publicly share the most basic facts about potential abuses.\n\nBut as bad as the news of this report was, the reality is even worse.\n\nTo understand why, we need to return to the metaphor of the rubber balls used to measure the size of different rooms. Remember that we were able to estimate the relative sizes of the rooms because in the larger room, the balls hit each other less frequently. There is an assumption hidden in that idea: that the balls travel freely through the air in the rooms.\n\nBut what if this assumption isn\u2019t true? What if, for example, some of the balls tend to be attracted to each other, so that when they are nearby, they veer toward each other, bounce against each other, and create a click? If this were true, we would hear many more clicks than we would if the balls were flying around without attracting each other. We would inaccurately infer that the room is smaller than in fact it really is. This is what happened with the Bureau of Justice Statistics report.\n\nWhen a middle-class person is killed by police, or when a person is killed by police in front of bystanders taking videos on phones, the media tend to report about this event very thoroughly. In circumstances like these, the police are very likely to report this case to the FBI because they know the FBI will hear about it. These cases are like the balls that tend to attract each other.\n\nConversely, if a person is killed by police without the presence of witnesses, and is from a social network of people fearful of retaliation by police, local police may know that they don\u2019t have to report this to the FBI. For the same reasons, this person\u2019s death might also remain undocumented by local media. This is the kind of killing that is unlikely to be reported at all.\n\nThese two examples show that if one source reports a given killing, the other source is also likely to report it. But if one source overlooks a killing, the other source is similarly likely to overlook it. In statistical terms, we say that the probability of reporting (or not) to the FBI \u2013 and therefore by the Supplementary Homicide Report \u2013 is positively correlated with the probability of reporting (or not) by the media or other sources recorded in the Arrest-Related Deaths database.\n\nOne result of this correlation is that our equation for estimating the total deaths \u2013 AB/M \u2013 is inaccurate because M is too large. The balls are not traveling freely through the room and striking each other only when they cross paths; instead many balls are drawn together and strike each other more frequently than expected. And if the intersection of our Venn diagram (M) is too large, our estimate of total deaths (N) is too small.\n\nThis is a standard problem with this statistical approach,[7] and we have calculated variations of this math in many contexts, including our study of genocide in Guatemala\u2019s armed internal conflict, ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, killings in Per\u00fa\u2019s civil war, homicides and lethal violence more generally in Colombia\u2019s civil conflict, and killings in Syria\u2019s ongoing war. In these projects, we are acutely sensitive to the problem we have here. In statistical language, this is called \u2018list dependence,\u2019 and there are decades of research done by mathematical statisticians that help correct estimates by measuring the strength of the attraction among the balls.\n\nOne way to understand this is that if we have three or more lists, we can measure the attraction between any pair of lists. With two lists we have no way to know what the correlation between the lists might be. With three or more lists, though, we can measure the attraction among the balls directly, and then account for that attraction to arrive at a much more accurate estimate.\n\nWhat my colleague Dr Kristian Lum and I did is to ask: what are these two lists?[8] One is a list maintained by police. The other is a list of people reported in the media. We\u2019ve used lists like this before. Many times. Many, many times.\n\nIn all our previous work in other countries, we used three, four, five, or more lists, and because we used three or more lists, we could calculate what the correlations were between all the pairs of lists in each country. Remember, the correlations are just numbers. So we asked ourselves: what is the usual range for correlations in similar scenarios? The answer is shown in the graph below, titled \u2018Estimated Pairwise List Dependence.\u2019 The range shows the correlations we have found among many pairs of lists of homicides in five countries. The higher the number at the bottom, the higher the correlation. The wider the bar, the larger the range of observed correlations. The lines extend left and right showing the most extreme values.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the correlation between the Arrest-Related Deaths database and the Supplementary Homicide Report. We have only two lists, and consequently we can\u2019t measure the correlation. But with the countries listed in this graph, we can draw an insight to what the correlation between the sources in the United States might look like. And with a possible correlation, we can adjust the estimate of US police homicides accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the second graph, titled \u2018Estimates of Total Deaths by Country\u2019s List Dependence.\u2019 This graph modifies the estimate of total police homicides given by the Bureau of Justice Statistics by asking the question: what would their estimate look like if the correlation between the two lists we have were like the correlations found among lists in these other countries? The BJS estimated 7,427 total police homicides. If we take into consideration the correlation between the two lists (that is, the attraction among the balls thrown into the room), how much would the estimate increase?\n\nThe bars in this graph show the range of estimated homicides if the correlation for the US sources were like the ranges we\u2019ve found in the countries listed in the left-hand column. If the US correlation were like the correlations among sources in Kosovo, the estimate would be a bit more than 10,000 US police homicides. If the US correlation were like the correlations among sources in Colombia, the estimate would be a bit less than 10,000. And so forth.\n\nTo understand the impact of the correlation between one list organized by the police \u2013 like the Supplementary Homicide Report \u2013 and another list organized from media sources \u2013 like the Arrest-Related Deaths database \u2013 it\u2019s most useful to compare them to other cases where we have similar kinds of lists, that is, police and media lists. And the range of correlations that are most informative for our investigation are those in Colombia, where there is a very effective police reporting database, and good databases maintained by human rights groups of homicides reported in the press.\n\nUsing the correlations from these lists, we conclude that for the eight-year period included in the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it is likely that there were approximately 10,000 homicides committed by the police, that is, about 1,250 per year. Keep in mind that the Bureau of Justice Statistics report itself excludes many jurisdictions in the United States that openly refuse to share any data with the FBI. The true number of homicides committed by police is therefore even higher. Though not a true estimate, my best guess of the number of police homicides in the United States is about 1,500 per year.\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this article, the estimate of 1,500 police homicides per year would mean that eight to ten per cent of all American homicide victims are killed by the police. Of all American homicide victims killed by people they don\u2019t know, approximately one-third of them are victims of the police.\n\nAmerica is a land ruled by fear. We fear that our children will be abducted by strangers, that crazed gunmen will perpetrate mass killings in our schools and theaters, that terrorists will gun us down or blow up our buildings, and that serial killers will stalk us on dark streets. All of these risks are real, but they are minuscule in probability: taken together, these threats constitute less than three per cent of total annual homicides in the US.[9] The numerically greater threat to our safety, and the largest single category of strangers who threaten us, are the people we have empowered to use deadly force to protect us from these less probable threats. The question for Americans is whether we will continue to tolerate police violence at this scale in return for protection against the quantitatively less likely threats.\n\nThis research was previously published as a blog post and in a white paper published by the HRDAG.\n\n[1] Less than 1% of all homicides involve three or more victims. See Cooper, A., and E.L. Smith, \u2018Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008,\u2019 US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (NCJ 236018), November, 2011, p. 24.\n\n[2] See, Cooper and Smith op. cit., Table 8. Note that for 36\u201344 per cent of homicides during this period, the victim-perpetrator relationship is unknown. Local law enforcement may not have reported the relationship, or the perpetrator may be unidentified. Case-based research on unknown victim-perpetrator relationships suggests that there is little or no bias caused by the missing data. See, e.g., Quinet, K., and S. Nunn, \u2018Establishing the Victim-Offender Relationship of Initially Unsolved Homicides: Partner, Family, Acquaintance, or Stranger?\u2019 Homicide Studies.\n\n[3] See an analytic merge of these two databases at MappingPoliceViolence.org\n\n[4] See the project list here and the publications here.\n\n[6] The estimate made by the BJS is slightly more complicated than the simple algebra shown here, so their estimate of the total number of police homicides (7427) is a little larger than the direct estimate ((1939+1681)*(1704+1681)/1681 = 7290). See their [section 3.1, p.13](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ardpatr.pdf) for details.\n\n[7] The canonical reference for this method is Bishop, Y., S.E. Fienberg, and P. Holland, Discrete Multivariate Analysis, MIT Press. 1975, especially chapter 6.\n\n[8] For all the math, see Lum and Ball, op. cit.\n\n[9] Mass killings represent less than one per cent of annual homicides; terrorists kill many fewer Americans than that; and although the total number of deaths due to serial killers is debated, the usual citation suggests it is less than one per cent of annual homicides.

The Times describes Nabi Saleh as having \u201clong-running disputes with a nearby Israeli settlement, Halamish, that Nabi Saleh residents say has stolen their land and water.\u201d The Times does not note that, as a colony on occupied territory, Halamish is illegal under international law.\n\nThe Newsweek piece says Tamimi \u201chas now been indicted on five counts of assaulting security forces,\u201d and that she is \u201ccharged with interfering with the soldiers\u2019 duties by preventing them from returning to their post.\u201d It notes that \u201cin May, she was charged with interfering with soldiers who were trying to arrest a protester throwing stones,\u201d and refers to her indictment two other times, including in the headline. At no point does the article mention that the proceedings are taking place in a military court. Similarly, an Associated Press (1/9/18) report refers to \u201cIsrael\u2019s hard-charging prosecution\u201d and \u201cthe charges\u201d against Tamimi, without mentioning that she is being tried by the same occupying military that shot her cousin.\n\nOmitting that information makes it sound like Tamimi will receive a fair legal process, but the evidence suggests the opposite. According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are subjected to a military court system that \u201cdoes not grant the right to due process and the rights derived from it,\u201d whereas Israelis illegally colonizing the Occupied Territories have the rights and privileges of a civilian legal system.\n\nIn the military courts, the age of majority is 16, which means that Palestinian teenagers can be tried as adults, while 18 is the age of majority for Israelis. Defence for Children International Palestine (DCIP), a group that has consultative status with the UN, reports that Israeli military court judges, who are either active duty or reserve officers in the Israeli military, \u201crarely exclude evidence obtained by coercion or torture, including confessions drafted in Hebrew, a language most Palestinian children do not understand.\u201d The Israeli military courts\u2019 conviction rate of greater than 99 percent underscores how stacked they are against Palestinians.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 framing of Tamimi\u2019s story suggests that the case\u2019s central issue is whether Palestinians or Israelis would have been better off if the soldier had reacted more violently to being slapped. The Times\u2019 David Halbfinger says\n\nThe paper even implied that Palestinians may be happy that Tamimi was arrested, writing that \u201cthe scene of the young woman being hauled away may have given Palestinians the clear-cut propaganda coup they had been denied by the original confrontation.\u201d\n\nCNN similarly trivialized Tamimi\u2019s arrest, noting that Israelis call her \u201cShirley Temper\u201d because of \u201cher long ginger curls\u201d and because they accuse her of \u201cstarring in carefully choreographed \u2018Pallywood\u2019 videos, a dismissive characterization of protests considered staged for the camera.\u201d\n\nWhile the Times and CNN provide a forum for speculation about whether Palestinians want their own children to suffer because it makes for good public relations, there is much this framing overlooks. For example, none of the above-mentioned articles mention the risk of Tamimi being seriously harmed in Israeli jails. Yet UNICEF charges Israel with subjecting Palestinian youth to \u201cpractices that amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture.\u201d These include children \u201cbeing aggressively awakened in the middle of the night by many armed soldiers and being forcibly brought to an interrogation center tied and blindfolded, sleep-deprived,\u201d and \u201cthreatened with death, physical violence, solitary confinement and sexual assault, against themselves or a family member.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s well-documented mistreatment of Palestinian youth is ignored in these reports, which suggests it is not Palestinian parents but Western reporters who are interested in crafting a public relations spectacle."}, "http://kurdishquestion.com/article/3571-belgian-court-decides-armed-struggle-not-terrorism-in-turkey-acquits-kurdish-politicians": {"title": "Mehmet Aksoy", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://kurdishquestion.com/article/3571-belgian-court-decides-armed-struggle-not-terrorism-in-turkey-acquits-kurdish-politicians", "text": "Our founder and editor-in-chief, our friend, our comrade, our loved one, our incredible activist, political organizer, writer, film-maker, our world, our everything,has become a martyr on the path to a more just, more free, more beautiful life.We honour him with our deepest respect and promise to keep the torch of revolution alive.We love you, heval.

In contrast, the images of his fellow revolutionary fighters Camilo Cienfuegos and Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara became common across Cuba in the decades since their deaths.\n\nMourning for Castro has been fervent and intense across the country since his death, particularly in rural eastern Cuba, where huge crowds have been shouting Castro's name and lining the roads to salute the funeral procession carrying his ashes.\n\n\"All of us would like to put Fidel's name on everything but in the end, Fidel is all of Cuba,\" said Juan Antonio Gonzalez, a 70-year-old retired economist. \"It was a decision of Fidel's, not Raul's, and I think he has to be respected.\"\n\nRaul Castro, 85, spoke at the end of a second massive rally in honor of Fidel as Cuba neared the end of a nine-day period of public mourning. Castro's ashes arrived Saturday afternoon in Santiago, ending a four-day journey across Cuba that began after a massive rally in Havana's Plaza of the Revolution.\n\nThousands of people welcomed the leader's remains to shouts of \"Fidel! I am Fidel!\" Hundreds of thousands more gathered in Santiago's Revolution Plaza Saturday night, cheering speeches by the heads of state-run groups of small farmers, women, revolutionary veterans and neighborhood watch committee members.\n\nThe event was attended by Bolivian President Evo Morales, Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela, along with former Brazilian presidents Dilma Rousseff and Lula da Silva.\n\nCastro's ashes will be interred Sunday morning in Santiago's Santa Ifigenia cemetery, ending the official mourning period."}, "http://sfbayview.com/2016/12/colin-kaepernick-just-started-a-black-panther-inspired-youth-camp-to-teach-kids-to-fight-oppression/": {"title": "Colin Kaepernick just started a Black Panther-inspired youth camp to teach kids to fight oppression", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://sfbayview.com/2016/12/colin-kaepernick-just-started-a-black-panther-inspired-youth-camp-to-teach-kids-to-fight-oppression/", "text": ""}, "https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2017/07/14/most-house-democrats-just-voted-for-a-defense-budget-far-bigger-than-trumps/#73dcc09f6ea0": {"title": "Forbes Welcome", "keywords": ["business news", " market analysis", " company profiles", " personal finance", " management", " entrepreneurship", " investments", " financial advice", " economy", " technology news"], "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2017/07/14/most-house-democrats-just-voted-for-a-defense-budget-far-bigger-than-trumps/#73dcc09f6ea0", "text": ""}, "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/14/rage-yvette-felarca-mounts-fox-news-interview/": {"title": "Rage against Yvette Felarca mounts after Fox News interview", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/14/rage-yvette-felarca-mounts-fox-news-interview/", "text": "Yvette Felarca, the Berkeley Unified middle-school teacher who is also a leader of the group By Any Means Necessary, appeared on Fox News on Monday to reiterate her stance that violent protesters were justified in shutting down a speech scheduled to be delivered by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley on Feb.1. Felarca\u2019s remarks have sparked an outcry from people who disagree with her views.\n\nThe phones, voicemail machines and email inboxes at the Berkeley Unified School District have been flooded with calls about Felarca, said Charles Burress, spokesman for the district. The main office of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, where Felarca teaches, has been swamped as well. (Berkeleyside has also gotten many emails, tweets and comments on the matter.)\n\n\u201cEvery (message) I\u2019ve seen has been opposed to having her employed by us,\u201d said Burress.\n\nA petition calling for her removal from BUSD garnered 2,000 signatures overnight, almost four times as many as had been collected in the last six months. (That number had gone over 4,000 by Wednesday.) A former King student set up the online petition at Change.org in July after he saw a video of Felarca yelling at a neo-Nazi at a Sacramento rally. On the video, Felarca is seen punching the man several times in the stomach, yelling \u201cGet the fuck off our streets,\u201d and then pulling his backpack. Felarca was later injured in the mel\u00e9e.\n\nThe Berkeley Unified School District wrote Felarca a warning letter a few days after the rally and placed her on paid administrative leave in September \u201cpending an investigation into concerns that have been raised,\u201d Burress said at the time. She returned to her classroom six weeks later and is still teaching. BUSD never explained its actions, citing confidentiality where personnel matters are concerned.\n\nHowever, a grievance, as well as a federal lawsuit filed by Felarca against the district, suggests the disciplinary action was in reaction to Felarca\u2019s political activity. In August, the district went into Felarca\u2019s bank account and withdrew the equivalent of 25.17 days of pay, according to the lawsuit. The district had retroactively un-approved a number of sick and personal days Felarca had taken \u201cclaiming that employees could not use their personal leave days to attend political protests and claiming that Felarca had used them for this purpose,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Felarca has stated she had doctor\u2019s notes for some of the sick days she was absent and that she has the right to attend political rallies.\n\nThe next hearing for Felarca\u2019s lawsuit against BUSD is on March 2. Former students of Felarca\u2019s who were questioned by BUSD representatives also filed a case against the district. That hearing is set for March 25.\n\nFelarca was at the Feb. 1 rally where a group of about 150 black-clad protesters removed metal barricades, threw rocks and incendiary devices at UC police, smashed windows at the MLK Student Union building, and later rampaged downtown, breaking bank windows and setting ATM machines on fire. Yet she has never stated directly that she and other members of BAMN were part of the violence.\n\nDespite glossing over the specifics of her action, Felarca has taken credit for \u201cshutting down\u201d Yiannopolous.\n\n\u201cHe should not be able to speak in public to spread his racist, misogynistic and homophobic lies,\u201d Felarca told Tucker Carlson on Fox News.\n\nFelarca could not be reached for comment Tuesday.\n\nFelarca has become the face of the radical opposition since the majority of the violent \u201cblack-bloc\u201d protesters covered their faces with ski masks and bandanas and have not spoken out since Feb. 1, despite widespread criticism of their tactics. But Felarca has been more than eager to talk. Berkeleyside interviewed her during the protests. Her interviews with KTVU and now Fox News have been watched thousands of times.\n\nFelarca\u2019s remarks prompted an outpouring of outrage on Twitter and on the YouTube channel featuring the interview, as well as directed to the school district. Critics have tweeted \u201cLet\u2019s riot at her house,\u201d and then published her home address. (An incorrect address, by the way.) They have listed the phone number for BUSD. They have written that Felarca should be waterboarded and arrested.\n\n\u201cI can not believe this racist is allowed to teach our children!\u201d a Houston man named Brad McPherson wrote to Berkeleyside. \u201cWhat is wrong with you people???\u201d\n\nOther comments were infused with swear words and derogatory remarks.\n\nThe school district issued a statement Wednesday from Ty Alper, the board president. He said the district could not respond to questions about whether Felarca would be reprimanded for her actions because it is a personnel matter. BUSD believes in the right of free speech, said Alper.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that we firmly support the First Amendment right to free speech,\u201d Alper said in the statement. \u201cWe also strongly condemn the use of violence in confronting speech, even speech we might find abhorrent or counter to the values of our community.\u201d\n\nEditors\u2019 note: This article was updated 2/15 at 3 p.m. to add the comments from the school district."}, "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-corbyn-idUKKBN19E0HB": {"title": "Labour leader Corbyn overtakes PM May in YouGov poll", "keywords": ["Britain", "Northern Ireland", "United Kingdom", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Theresa May", "UK", "BRITAIN", "POLITICS", "CORBYN", "Elections / Voting", "Lower House Elections", "Western Europe", "Government / Politics", "Currencies / Foreign Exchange Markets", "Corporate Events", "European Union", "Major News", "Government Borrowing Requirement", "Europe", "United Kingdom"], "url": "http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-corbyn-idUKKBN19E0HB", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has overtaken Theresa May for the first time as voters\u2019 choice for who would make the best prime minister, a YouGov poll for The Times newspaper showed.\n\nAfter PM May\u2019s botched gamble on a June 8 snap election deprived her Conservative Party of a majority, she is trying to strike a deal with Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government.\n\nWhen asked who make the best prime minister, the YouGov poll for The Times showed 35 percent of voters would prefer Corbyn, while 34 percent favoured May.

If you haven\u2019t, here it is. Be warned: it\u2019s an incredibly disturbing video:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the story, from Lucas Aulbach at the Courier-Journal:\n\nThis is a horrifying story, and it\u2019s still unfolding on social media. I\u2019ve noticed something about the reaction to United. People have been making jokes about the incident on Twitter. Which is okay! Jokes are part of the news cycle. They\u2019re how we process things as a culture. And particularly in this case, the jokes are very telling. This one is a perfect example of the tone and tenor of the comedy I\u2019ve been seeing:\n\nThen there\u2019s the business world\u2019s response to the news, which is the exact opposite of everyone else\u2019s response to the news:\n\nAnd then the content mines immediately chimed in with their hot-take-clickbait. The most horrifying example of the form is this Yahoo Finance story by Ethan Wolff-Mann, headlined \u201cHow to reduce the chances of getting dragged off your United flight.\u201d An excerpt:\n\nSo we\u2019ve got the jokes about air travel being a hellish dystopia for anyone not in first class. We\u2019ve got Wall Street cashing in on the metrics while ignoring the human horror of the story. And we\u2019ve got \u201chelpful\u201d news stories explaining that in order to not have this happen to you, it\u2019s wise to exercise some sort of privilege. It should be clear to anyone who\u2019s paying attention that this story is not about customer service. It\u2019s about income inequality. Helaine Olen posted a very good thread on Twitter about this:\n\nWhen you get down to it, like everything else in America today, this is about the haves and the have-nots. If you\u2019re in first class, you don\u2019t need to worry about shock troops coming and beating you until you get out of the seat that you bought. If you\u2019re not in first class, you\u2019re on your own. If you\u2019re in the top one percent on Wall Street, you turn a tidy profit off the whole ordeal. This is what class warfare looks like.\n\nI wrote about this topic last month. Visit any department store in America and you\u2019ll see that the corporatization of America has led to a ghastly pursuit for profits over all else. Big Box retailers aren\u2019t interested in providing customer service anymore, they\u2019re interested in profits. This is why shopping at corporate chains has become an awful experience where you have to answer six obnoxious questions about email lists and company credit cards every time you try to check out. You won\u2019t be arrested for refusing to sign up for a Macy\u2019s card, but you will be treated like garbage. Only people who can afford to shop at high-end stores \u2014 or people lucky enough to live in quality economies like Seattle that support independent retailers \u2014 get to enjoy real customer service anymore.\n\nThe situation is heightened on airlines for a couple of reasons. The first, obviously, is the security state that ballooned in size after 9/11. But the other reason is deregulation. Phillip Longman and Lina Khan wrote a great piece for Washington Monthly in 2012 about what trickle-down policies like deregulation have done to the airline experience for non-wealthy passengers:\n\nThe video that made its way across the internet today is what \u201cgetting worse\u201d looks like. Here\u2019s the thing: when you support trickle-down economic policies that put profits before people, this is what you get. Low-wage jobs, deregulation, and tax cuts for huge corporations result in a culture in which businesses enjoy a tremendous amount of power over ordinary citizens.\n\nSo what can we do about this? I wish I had easy answers for you, but it\u2019s pretty obvious that an online petition isn\u2019t going to resolve the United situation \u2014 especially since Wall Street views it as a net win and is rewarding United for its overbooking situation. No, it\u2019s going to take a lot of work to put the power back in the hands of the people.\n\nWe must support middle-out policies like higher wages for everyone, higher taxes for corporations and the wealthy, and sensible regulations on business. If every American feels like they have a hand in America\u2019s success, we\u2019ll see less tolerance for intolerable actions like what happened on that United flight. Then, when we\u2019ve moved the balance more toward something resembling equity, we can talk about commonsense ideas like breaking up monopolies and penalizing malicious businesses like United for harming Americans who do everything right and play by the rules.\n\nMaybe the worst thing about that video is how completely believable it was for anyone who\u2019s flown over the last few years. We\u2019ve all experienced the awfulness of flying, and we recognize it as maybe the most literal manifestation of America\u2019s current class situation: the few sit up front in comfort while the many experience more and more discomfort in the back of the plane. We lose inches of legroom, we\u2019re charged more and more for our carry-ons, and we\u2019re offered less and less in return. This situation isn\u2019t going to get any better until we stand up and demand that things change. This isn\u2019t about one airline \u2014 hell, it\u2019s not even about air travel. It\u2019s about class in America, and it\u2019s time to demand our fair share."}, "http://q13fox.com/2017/08/12/police-20-year-old-ohio-man-charged-with-second-degree-murder-in-crash-at-virginia-rally/": {"title": "Police: 20-year-old Ohio man charged with second-degree murder in crash at Virginia rally", "keywords": ["national & world news", " violence in charlottesville"], "url": "http://q13fox.com/2017/08/12/police-20-year-old-ohio-man-charged-with-second-degree-murder-in-crash-at-virginia-rally/", "text": "\u00d7 Police: 20-year-old Ohio man charged with second-degree murder in crash at Virginia rally\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 Authorities say a 20-year-old Ohio man accused of driving a car into a group of counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally has been charged with second-degree murder and other counts.\n\nThe Charlottesville Police Department said in a statement Saturday night that James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio also faces three counts of malicious wounding, and one count related to leaving the scene.\n\nCol.

Bush, a man vilified by liberals for years, was being rehabilitated, particularly in the wake of Trump\u2019s rise.\n\nThursday\u2019s speech, in which Bush obliquely took on Trump, was merely the latest in a years-long campaign to restore his reputation and welcome him back into the fold of respectability.\n\nRemember when Michelle Obama gave him a hug?\n\n \n\n That was step two or three. This week\u2019s speech was step four.\n\nFor years prior to that, our image of Bush was emblazoned by the memory of not only the Iraq War, which killed hundreds of thousands of people, of not only the casual violence, the fratboyish, near-sociopathic, irresponsibility, of Bush\u2019s rhetoric of war (remember when, after the Iraq War was over, in June 2003, Bush turned to his administrator general there, Jay Garner, and said, \u201cHey, Jay, you want to do Iran?\u201d). It was also imprinted with the memory of the laziness and incuriosity, the buoyant indifference, that got us into war, not just the Iraq War but also the war on terror (the original sin of it all, if you ask me) in the first place.\n\nAll those now pining for the pre-9/11 George W. Bush, a man who took his responsibilities to the nation \u2014 and his duty to its people \u2014 seriously, an anti-Trump who, whatever his many flaws, at least had a sense of the gravitas of his office and its burdens, might want to have a read-through to what was going down in the Bush administration circa August 2001.\n\nRoemer then asked Tenet if he mentioned Moussaoui to President Bush at one of their frequent morning briefings. Tenet replied, \u201cI was not in briefings at this time.\u201d Bush, he noted, \u201cwas on vacation.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t see the president at all in August 2001. During the entire month, Bush was at his ranch in Texas. \u201cYou never talked with him?\u201d Roemer asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Tenet replied. . . . And there you have it. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has made a big point of the fact that Tenet briefed the president nearly every day. Yet at the peak moment of threat, the two didn\u2019t talk at all. At a time when action was needed, and orders for action had to come from the top, the man at the top was resting undisturbed. Throughout that summer, we now well know, Tenet, Richard Clarke, and several other officials were running around with their \u201chair on fire,\u201d warning that al-Qaida was about to unleash a monumental attack. On Aug. 6, Bush was given the now-famous President\u2019s Daily Brief (by one of Tenet\u2019s underlings), warning that this attack might take place \u201cinside the United States.\u201d For the previous few years \u2014 as Philip Zelikow, the commission\u2019s staff director, revealed this morning \u2014 the CIA had issued several warnings that terrorists might fly commercial airplanes into buildings or cities. And now, we learn today, at this peak moment, Tenet hears about Moussaoui. Someone might have added 2 + 2 + 2 and possibly busted up the conspiracy. But the president was down on the ranch, taking it easy. Tenet wasn\u2019t with him. Tenet never talked with him. Rice \u2014 as she has testified \u2014 wasn\u2019t with Bush, either. He was on his own and, willfully, out of touch.\n\nBut now that\u2019s all forgotten. Or being forgotten.\n\nIt may be, however, when it comes to Trump\u2019s rehabilitation, that things will move faster than I predicted, that Trump won\u2019t have to wait as long as Bush to get out of the doghouse.\n\nAfter all, Sean Spicer is now up at Harvard, tutoring the hopefuls of tomorrow\u2019s ruling class.\n\nAnd just after Roy Moore got the Senate nomination in Alabama, Paul Begala was quoted in : \u201cWhat do they say in recoveries? You have to hit bottom? I thought that, with Trump, they [the GOP] hit bottom. But, apparently not, because Moore is worse.\u201d\n\nAnd there you have it, the stage is already being set. Given the relentless march rightward of the Republican Party, there will always be something worse waiting in the wings, something worse that will inevitably furnish Trump with a retrospective glow \u2014 even though it was Trump who set the stage for that something worse, in the same way that it was Bush who set the stage for Trump.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a message to everyone on Twitter or Facebook saying, gee, I never thought I\u2019d be saying this, but next to Trump, George W.

I tell people how Tyler and I opened every single cage and released 2,000 mink to save their lives. And once they have the context, I segue into the terrorism thing.\n\nNow that I have been out of prison for more than a year, I can be a bit more lighthearted about it. But the seventh circuit court of appeals doesn\u2019t see the humor.\n\nLast Wednesday, the court upheld the constitutionality of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, the federal statute that put me away for three years and that my lawyers at the Center for Constitutional Rights have been trying to challenge for nearly a decade.\n\nThe Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act is a piece of designer legislation written and paid for by the agriculture and pharmaceutical industries. It federalizes non-violent property crime and punishes it as terrorism \u2013 but only when the perpetrators are motivated by the belief that animals deserve to live free from violence.\n\nThe court explicitly stated that the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act did not apply to four Fresno, California, teenagers who sneaked into a Foster Farms facility and bludgeoned 900 chickens to death with a golf club because \u201cthey killed the chickens for no reason\u201d.\n\nPut succinctly, I am a terrorist not because of what I did, but because the government dislikes why I did it.\n\nI remember organizing my first protest, outside of the circus, in 2005. I was 19 years old. My friend and I argued with the police about whether our group could stand on a courtyard by the Staples Center and whether we could use megaphones. We asserted our rights, and we were successful.\n\nThat same year, the FBI declared animal rights activists to be the nation\u2019s \u201cnumber one domestic terrorism threat\u201d. A year later, Congress passed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. Suddenly, I found myself being followed as I drove to work. My parents and siblings were harassed. My home was raided by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Three times.\n\nWe no longer argued with the police about where we could chant and hold our signs. The police brandished assault rifles, and we did as they said. Then, when we were done, they openly followed us back to our cars to photograph our license plates. While the rest of the nation took no notice, simply organizing a protest became a frightening prospect if you were an animal rights activist.\n\nIn this atmosphere, more and more of my friends stopped speaking out for animals. Countless times I heard people say they were scared of being placed on a list. More than once, someone told me they had canceled their subscriptions to animal-related magazines.\n\nThe Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act achieved its intended outcome. When the distinguishing feature of a \u201cterrorist\u201d is simply an ethical concern for animals, such concerns become marginalized, and voicing them becomes dangerous. What remains is silence.\n\nNow I watch as the rhetoric honed and the precedents established against animal rights activists are expanded to cover an increasingly broad swath of dissent. In Donald Trump\u2019s America, states across the country are introducing legislation designed to bully and deter protesters. Some of these proposed laws include five-year prison sentences for protesters who block traffic.\n\nLawmakers in Arizona seek to charge protest groups as organized criminals, and seize their assets. In Oregon, a statute would automatically expel students who violate protest laws. Missouri wants to criminalize the use of costumes during protests. And, following the horrors of Charlottesville, lawmakers in half a dozen states have introduced legislation to indemnify drivers who run over protesters, as if the drivers were the ones in need of protection.\n\nThis is not how a free society operates. Our rights are meaningless if the government intimidates us out of using them. But as Wednesday\u2019s decision makes clear, the judiciary will not protect us from such abuse. The court has legitimized the government\u2019s use of the word \u201cterrorism\u201d to describe nearly any activity of which it disapproves \u2013 and emboldened lawmakers around the country who are beginning to do just that.\n\nIt is evident that our leaders consider our speech and assembly a threat to their unencumbered exercise of power. Now, more than ever, we must show them that they are right."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/22/inequality-gap-widens-as-42-people-hold-same-wealth-as-37bn-poorest": {"title": "Inequality gap widens as 42 people hold same wealth as 3.7bn poorest", "keywords": ["Inequality", "Davos 2018", "Oxfam", "Poverty", "Business", "UK news", "Social exclusion", "World news", "Global economy", "Economics", "Society", "Income inequality", "US income inequality", "US news"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/22/inequality-gap-widens-as-42-people-hold-same-wealth-as-37bn-poorest", "text": "The development charity Oxfam has called for action to tackle the growing gap between rich and poor as it launched a new report showing that 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion who make up the poorest half of the world\u2019s population.\n\nIn a report published on Monday to coincide with the gathering of some of the world\u2019s richest people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Oxfam said billionaires had been created at a record rate of one every two days over the past 12 months, at a time when the bottom 50% of the world\u2019s population had seen no increase in wealth. It added that 82% of the global wealth generated in 2017 went to the most wealthy 1%.\n\nThe charity said it was \u201cunacceptable and unsustainable\u201d for a tiny minority to accumulate so much wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggled on poverty pay. It called on world leaders to turn rhetoric about inequality into policies to tackle tax evasion and boost the pay of workers.\n\n\n\nMark Goldring, Oxfam GB chief executive, said: \u201cThe concentration of extreme wealth at the top is not a sign of a thriving economy, but a symptom of a system that is failing the millions of hardworking people on poverty wages who make our clothes and grow our food.\u201d\n\n\n\nBooming global stock markets have been the main reason for the increase in wealth of those holding financial assets during 2017. The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, saw his wealth rise by $6bn (\u00a34.3bn) in the first 10 days of 2017 as a result of a bull market on Wall Street, making him the world\u2019s richest man.\n\nOxfam said it had made changes to its wealth calculations as a result of new data from the bank Credit Suisse. Under the revised figures, 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorer half of the world\u2019s population, compared with 61 people last year and 380 in 2009. At the time of last year\u2019s report, Oxfam said that eight billionaires held the same wealth as half the world\u2019s population.\n\nThe charity added that the wealth of billionaires had risen by 13% a year on average in the decade from 2006 to 2015, with the increase of $762bn (\u00a3550bn) in 2017 enough to end extreme poverty seven times over. It said nine out of 10 of the world\u2019s 2,043 dollar billionaires were men.\n\nGoldring said: \u201cFor work to be a genuine route out of poverty we need to ensure that ordinary workers receive a living wage and can insist on decent conditions, and that women are not discriminated against. If that means less for the already wealthy then that is a price that we \u2013 and they \u2013 should be willing to pay.\u201d\n\nAn Oxfam survey of 70,000 people in 10 countries, including the UK, showed support for action to tackle inequality. Nearly two-thirds of people \u2013 72% in the UK \u2013 said they want their government to urgently address the income gap between rich and poor in their country.\n\nIn the UK, when asked what a typical British chief executive earned in comparison with an unskilled worker, people guessed 33 times as much. When asked what the ideal ratio should be, they said 7:1. Oxfam said that FTSE 100 bosses earned on average 120 times more than the average employee.\n\nGoldring said it was time to rethink a global economy in which there was excessive corporate influence on policymaking, erosion of workers\u2019 rights and a relentless drive to minimise costs in order to maximise returns to investors.\n\nMark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: \u201cOxfam is promoting a race to the bottom. Richer people are already highly taxed people \u2013 reducing their wealth beyond a certain point won\u2019t lead to redistribution, it will destroy it to the benefit of no one.

Of the 382 agencies they spoke with, \u201c74 percent reported anti-government extremism as one of the top three terrorist threats in their jurisdiction,\u201d while only \u201c39 percent listed extremism connected with Al Qaeda or like-minded terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the percentage of refugees that are connected to terrorist plots is vanishingly small."}, "http://www.epi.org/publication/women-would-lose-4-6-billion-in-earned-tips-if-the-administrations-tip-stealing-rule-is-finalized-overall-tipped-workers-would-lose-5-8-billion/": {"title": "Women would lose $4.6 billion in earned tips if the administration\u2019s \u2018tip stealing\u2019 rule is finalized: Overall, workers would lose $5.8 billion", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.epi.org/publication/women-would-lose-4-6-billion-in-earned-tips-if-the-administrations-tip-stealing-rule-is-finalized-overall-tipped-workers-would-lose-5-8-billion/", "text": "A correction was made January 23 to put the state data in order in Table 2\n\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) has proposed a rule that would make it legal for employers to pocket their workers\u2019 tips, as long as they pay those workers at least the minimum wage. The proposed rule rescinds portions of longstanding DOL regulations that prohibit employers from taking tips. We estimate that if the rule is finalized, every year workers will lose $5.8 billion in tips, as tips are shifted from workers to employers. Of the $5.8 billion, nearly 80 percent\u2014$4.6 billion\u2014would be taken from women who are working in tipped jobs.\n\nDOL has masked the fact that this rule would be a windfall to restaurant owners and other employers\u2014out of the pockets of tipped workers\u2014by making it sound as if this rule is about tip pooling. Of course, once employers have full control of tips, one of the things they could do with those tips is distribute them to \u201cback of the house\u201d workers like dishwashers and cooks. But the proposed rule does not require employers to distribute the tips, so employers would be no more likely to share tips with back-of-the-house workers than they would be to make any other choice about what to do with a business windfall, including using the money to make capital improvements to their establishments, to increase executive pay, or to line their own pockets.\n\nMany employers pocket tips even now, when it is illegal for them to do so (for example, research on workers in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York found that 12 percent of tipped workers had tips stolen from them by their employer or supervisor). The fact that illegal tip theft is so prevalent underscores that when employers can legally pocket tips, many will. And basic economic logic dictates that it is highly unlikely that back-of-the-house workers will get more pay. There is currently no limit to what these workers can be paid, so employers are already paying their back-of-the-house workers what they need to pay to attract workers willing to work in those jobs. If employers do share some tips with them, it will likely be offset by a reduction in their base pay, leaving their take-home pay largely unaffected.\n\nThe economic effects of this rule are as follows: (1) tipped workers will lose $5.8 billion a year in tips, (2) the take-home pay of back-of-the-house workers will remain largely unchanged, and (3) employers will get a $5.8 billion a year windfall. The $5.8 billion is 16.1 percent of the estimated $36.4 billion in tips earned by tipped workers annually and amounts to more than $1,000 per year on average across all tipped workers.\n\nTable 1 breaks down the $5.8 billion by gender and by race/ethnicity, and Table 2 breaks down the $5.8 billion by state. Table 1 shows that women working in tipped jobs would lose $4.6 billion annually as a result of the rule, while men working in tipped jobs would lose $1.2 billion. In other words, nearly 80 percent of the tips that would be taken by employers as a result of this rule would come out of the pockets of women and their families. (The specific share, calculated from unrounded numbers, is 78.7 percent.) Because women are both more likely to be tipped workers and to earn lower wages, this rule would disproportionately harm them.\n\nTable 1 also shows that white non-Hispanic tipped workers would lose $3.5 billion, black non-Hispanic tipped workers would lose $480.2 million, Hispanic workers of any race would lose $1.4 billion, Asian workers would lose $382.5 million, and tipped workers who are of another race would lose $102.4 million. The differences among these groups can be attributed to several broad factors, including differences among the groups in number of tipped workers, amount of tips earned, and share of tips earned at or above the minimum wage (the last factor matters since, under the proposed rule, employers must pay workers the full minimum wage before they can legally take tips). There are likely many root sources of these underlying differences, including differences in job opportunities and pay, discrimination in tipping, and different concentrations of groups in states that allow employers to take large tip credits.\n\nTellingly, DOL did not provide an estimate of the amount of tips that will be shifted from workers to employers\u2014even though it was legally required, as a part of the rulemaking process, to assess all quantifiable costs and benefits \u201cto the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated.\u201d EPI easily produced an estimate using a methodology that is very much in the spirit of estimates the Department of Labor regularly produces; DOL obviously could have produced an estimate. But they couldn\u2019t both produce a good faith estimate (which would necessarily have shown a substantial shift of tips from workers to employers) and maintain the fiction that this rule is primarily about tip pooling, so they opted to ignore legally required steps in the rulemaking process.\n\nThis is a proposed rule and, as of the writing of this paper, is open for public comment. Until the comment period closes on February 5, anyone can submit a comment, and the Department of Labor is required to read all public comments before deciding what the final rule will look like.\n\nTo submit a comment to the Department of Labor on this proposed rule, click here.\n\nHeidi Shierholz, David Cooper, Julia Wolfe, and Ben Zipperer, Employers Would Pocket $5.8 Billion of Workers\u2019 Tips under Trump Administration\u2019s Proposed \u2018Tip Stealing\u2019 Rule, Economic Policy Institute, December 14, 2017.\n\nTipped workers in our sample include those workers in occupations that are predominantly tipped, such as restaurant servers, bartenders, gaming service workers, barbers, hairstylists, and other personal appearance workers.\n\nAnnette Bernhardt et al., Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers: Violations of Employment and Labor Laws in America\u2019s Cities, 2009, Center for Urban Economic Development, National Employment Law Project, and UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, 2009.\n\nThe methodology for finding that tipped workers earn $36.4 billion in tips annually, and for estimating that, under the proposed rule, $5.8 billion in tips would be shifted from workers to employers, can be found in Heidi Shierholz, David Cooper, Julia Wolfe, and Ben Zipperer, Employers Would Pocket $5.8 Billion of Workers\u2019 Tips under Trump Administration\u2019s Proposed \u2018Tip Stealing\u2019 Rule, Economic Policy Institute, December 14, 2017. To get the $1,000 per tipped worker, we note that IRS W-2 data, Table 5.A, shows that there were 5.1 million taxpayers with social security tips in 2013. We adjust the 2013 number to 2016 using the growth rate between 2013 and 2016 of all employees in the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, 5.9 percent, which yields an estimated number of tipped workers in 2016 of roughly 5.4 million. Dividing $5.8 billion by 5.4 million workers yields slightly more than $1,000 per tipped worker.\n\nTo get the breakdowns by state and race/ethnicity, we follow the same methodology described in our original report\u2019s methodology appendix, but we do the CPS calculations separately for each demographic group. See Heidi Shierholz, David Cooper, Julia Wolfe, and Ben Zipperer, Employers Would Pocket $5.8 Billion of Workers\u2019 Tips under Trump Administration\u2019s Proposed \u2018Tip Stealing\u2019 Rule, Economic Policy Institute, December 14, 2017.\n\nThe differences between different groups can be attributed to five main factors mathematically: (1) Different groups have different numbers of tipped workers. For example, a 2014 report from Sylvia Allegretto and David Cooper shows that two-thirds of tipped workers are women. Further, 61.5 percent are white non-Hispanic, 8.5 percent are black non-Hispanic, 17.7 percent are Hispanic, and 12.3 percent are Asian or another race. (2) Different groups of tipped workers earn different amounts of tips. For example, Allegretto and Cooper\u2019s report also shows that the median wage (including tips) of female tipped workers is $10.07, compared with $10.63 for men. Further, for white tipped workers the median wage is $10.25, for black tipped workers it is $10.12, for Hispanic tipped workers it is $9.98, and for tipped workers who are Asian or another race it is $10.63. (3) As we discuss in the methodology appendix in our December 2017 report, different groups have different shares of tips earned above their minimum wage. The estimates do not include any tips earned below the minimum wage, since under the proposed rule, employers must pay workers the full minimum wage before they can legally take tips. According to our analysis in the current study, among women working in tipped jobs, 68.8 percent of wages are earned above the minimum wage, whereas among men working in tipped jobs, the share is 76.4 percent. Among white tipped workers it is 70.0 percent, among black tipped workers it is 65.8 percent, among Hispanic tipped workers it is 74.8 percent, among Asian tipped workers it is 81.2 percent, and among tipped workers who are another race, it is 68.2 percent. (4) Different groups have different shares of tips earned above each worker\u2019s \u201coutside option\u201d wage. A tipped worker\u2019s outside option wage is the wage he or she could get at a nontipped job. (We determine the outside option wage using regression analysis to predict the wage each tipped worker would likely earn in a nontipped job given their observable characteristics. See the methodology appendix in our previous report.) The estimates do not include any tips earned below a workers\u2019 outside option wage, since economic logic dictates that an employer will not reduce a worker\u2019s take-home pay lower than what the worker would earn in their outside option, since the employer would likely lose that worker if it did. (5) Different groups are differently concentrated in states that have state law or circuit court cases that affect how much of workers\u2019 tips employers will likely be able to pocket.

But you want to try to encourage that in your children.\"\n\nRichard Collins III, 23, died Saturday, three days before he was supposed to graduate from historically black Bowie State University.\n\nSean Christopher Urbanski, 22, was charged with murder and assault for the attack that University of Maryland police Chief David Mitchell called \"totally unprovoked.\"\n\nIn court, a judge held Urbanski without bond at an appearance Monday afternoon.\n\n\"He is an absolute danger to the community,\" she said.\n\nUrbanski's parents attended the hearing. As prosecutors stated the charges, the accused attacker's father closed his eyes.\n\nUrbanski appeared on a video monitor, wearing an orange jumpsuit. He did not speak.\n\nHis lawyer cited media reports saying Urbanski had been intoxicated at the time of the crime. He requested bond, drug counseling and GPS monitoring for Urbanski, but the judge refused.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Urbanski's father declined to comment. His mother tried to cover her face.\n\nThe University of Maryland police sought the FBI's help after learning Urbanski is a member of a Facebook group called Alt-Reich Nation.\n\n\"Suffice it to say that it's despicable. It shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith and especially African Americans,\" Mitchell said at a news conference Sunday.\n\nThe case is making headlines as a possible hate crime, but the FBI and the Prince George\u2019s County state\u2019s attorney said that determination will take more time, while the circumstances of the crime are investigated first. The FBI said they are assisting in some of the aspects of the investigation.\n\n\n\n\"We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime,\" said Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Baltimore.\n\nCollins' father told NBC News he was in shock.\n\n\"I'm in no place to feel very many emotions beside sadness and just a deep sense of personal loss,\" he said.\n\n\"A parent's worst nightmare has just reached my doorstep,\" he continued.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan expressed outrage on his Facebook page about the attack while sending deepest condolences to the family, friends and college communities.\n\n\"The individual responsible for this young man\u2019s death must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Hogan wrote. \"Violence and hatred have no place in our communities and will never be tolerated. In the wake of this senseless tragedy, I ask that all Marylanders show strength and come together in this time of grieving.\"\n\nBefore Collins was stabbed, he was standing at a bus stop with two friends near the University of Maryland's Montgomery Hall on Regents Drive about 3 a.m. Saturday, police said.\n\nCourt documents obtained by News4 say Collins was waiting for the university's shuttle bus with his friends when they realized the shuttle bus had stopped running for the night. They decided to call an Uber and were waiting for one to arrive when they heard Urbanski screaming nearby, the documents say.\n\nCollins and his friends watched Urbanski approach them.\n\n\"Step left, step left if you know what's best for you,\" witnesses told police Urbanski said.\n\nUrbanski continued to approach Collins and his friends. Then, he pulled out a knife with a 3- to 4-inch silver blade and stabbed Collins once in the chest, the documents say.\n\nOne of Collins' friends ran toward Baltimore Avenue to call 911 and asked the Uber driver to also call for help. Witnesses helped Collins until police and medics arrived.\n\nTwo Prince George's County police officers found Urbanski sitting on a bench at a bus stop about 50 feet from where Collins had collapsed. Officers found a knife in Urbanski's front right pocket, the documents say.\n\nWitnesses identified him as the attacker. He was taken into custody by the university's police department.\n\nCollins was taken to Prince George's Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead at 4:10 a.m.\n\n\"It never gets any worse than this,\" the University of Maryland police chief said. \"When I sat with the victim's father, who is a military veteran, and his pastor, and we shed tears together ... I can tell you, it rips your heart out.\"\n\nBrian Douglas, who got to know Collins when they took a class together, said the man was looking forward to graduation.\n\n\"He was just nice, just a good young man all around. You can't find those too often in today's society,\" Douglas said.\n\nCiera Sorrell, who also took a class with Collins, said his killing shocked the Bowie State community.\n\n\"Everyone is in disbelief,\" she said. \"He seemed so excited to get to live his life, and he doesn't have that chance anymore.\"\n\nThe attack has sparked fear on the University of Maryland campus.\n\n\"If I'm a person of color, I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that,\" Mitchell said.\n\nCampus police have stepped up patrols on and around campus.\n\nDr. Artie Lee Travis, vice president for student affairs at Bowie State University, said the school hopes the investigation moves forward as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Hate has no place in America,'' he said. \"Hate has no place on a college campus, where young minds are coming together to try to change the world.\"\n\nUrbanski, of Severna Park, Maryland, is being held without bond.\n\nA vigil for Collins is scheduled for Monday evening on Bowie State's campus.\n\nOn the University of Maryland campus, flowers and candles were placed at the bus stop where Collins' life was taken."}, "http://fair.org/home/as-democratic-voters-shift-left-liberal-media-keep-shifting-right/": {"title": "As Democratic Voters Shift Left, \u2018Liberal Media\u2019 Keep Shifting Right", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://fair.org/home/as-democratic-voters-shift-left-liberal-media-keep-shifting-right/", "text": "In the past few years, the Democratic Party\u2019s rank and file have shifted left on major issues. From healthcare to legalization of drugs to taxes, the heart of the party has grown more progressive\u2014and, in many instances, overtly socialist in nature. Forty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents now identify as both socially liberal and economically moderate or liberal, up from 39 percent in 2008 and 30 percent in 2001.\n\nIn contrast, nominally liberal media\u2014or major media whose editorial line is reliably pro-Democratic\u2014have drifted rightward. On Wednesday, MSNBC announced it had hired torture-supporting, climate-denying, anti-Arab racist Bret Stephens, a recent hire at the New York Times opinion page. Stephens\u2014whose very first article at the Times had to be corrected due to his misunderstanding of basic climate science\u2014will be an \u201con-air contributor\u201d for both MSNBC and NBC.\n\nThis pickup continues a conservative hiring spree at MSNBC, including former George Bush adviser Nicolle Wallace, right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt, old-school conservative Washington Post columnist George Will, and former Fox News stars Greta Van Susteren and Megyn Kelly (though Van Susteren\u2019s show has already been canceled due to comically low ratings).\n\nDespite their ratings going up as their marquee liberal firebrands rail against Donald Trump on a day-to-day basis, MSNBC has decided not to double down on this approach, but rather is populating its 24-hour broadcast with an increasing number of Bush-era also-rans and ex\u2013Fox News personalities. At the same time, the New York Times has added the far-right Stephens to its coveted and influential list of full-time columnists\u2014joining fellow #nevertrump conservatives David Brooks and Ross Douthat.\n\nAs notable as their outreach to the right is these outlets\u2019 resolute resistance to introducing any new voices to the left of the party\u2019s corporate center. Forty-three percent of Democratic voters backed Bernie Sanders in the primary, yet the New York Times and MSNBC editorial teams don\u2019t have one vocal Sanders supporter. Some, certainly, are sympathetic to him, such as MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes, and the Times\u2019 Charles Blow. But none openly back him in the way Paul Krugman, Gail Collins and Joy-Ann Reid (FAIR.org, 4/20/17) openly spin for his more centrist primary opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (Indeed, MSNBC\u2019s Reid spends an unhealthy amount of time on Twitter dragging the Vermont senator for being inadequately obsequious to the corporate wing of the party.)\n\nObviously, sitting around waiting for corporate-owned media to embrace subversive left political commentary\u2014or even Sanders\u2019 brand of soft European-style social democracy\u2014is a fool\u2019s errand, and one should be under no illusions this will ever happen. But the lack of any effort to represent a major sector of their audience is still worth pointing out. If the media were \u201call about the clicks\u201d or \u201cthe views,\u201d a major network would jump at the chance to at least have one token leftist to appeal to this underserved demographic. Yet they keep going in the other direction, hiring more right wingers without any apparent marketing reason to do so.\n\nShaping ideology and public opinion is less about the voices we hear, and more about those we don\u2019t. The range of debate is set by liberal gatekeepers like the Times and MSNBC, and it\u2019s clear, with each additional hire, the Overton window at these institutions won\u2019t budge one inch to the left, regardless of how much their consumers do. One is left to conclude that MSNBC and the New York Times are not veering right despite Democratic voters\u2019 increasing embrace of left policies; they\u2019re doing so precisely because of it.\n\nYou can send a message to the New York Times at letters@nytimes.com (Twitter:@NYTimes).

West, a philosopher, political activist, and one of America\u2019s most provocative public intellectuals, wrote Race Matters a year after the LA race riots, which left more than 50 people dead and more than 2,000 injured in the spring of 1992.\n\nBut while West told me he was on the \u201cedge of hope\u201d when the book first came out, he believes that the outlook on racial relations in America is even bleaker now. Rather than citing President Trump as the problem, West calls him a \u201csign of our spiritual bankruptcy.\u201d He is equally critical of President Obama, who West cites as a symbol of the neoliberal establishment, especially when it comes to his Wall Street bailout and drone strikes.\n\nI spoke with West, currently a professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy at Harvard University, about why he thinks that Obama\u2019s ascension should not be seen as a culmination of Malcolm X\u2019s activism, the role of race in Trump\u2019s election, and his feelings about the American flag. Here is our conversation, edited for length and clarity.\n\nHope Reese: When you wrote Race Matters, it was a dark time in terms of what was happening with black Americans after the LA race riots. Now it\u2019s 25 years later. Did you expect things would improve? Are you surprised by where the country is, in terms of racial relations?\n\nCornel West: History is always open-ended\u2013\u2013unfinished and incomplete. I was hoping that we would be able to move in a much stronger direction that tilts towards empowering the weak and vulnerable in our society, but we\u2019ve moved in the exact opposite direction. I was at the edge of hope when I wrote Race Matters 25 years ago. I have even less hope now, which means we just have to fight that much more intensely. There\u2019s a sense in which hope is as much a consequence of action as it is a cause of action.\n\nAs things become more hopeless, we have to fight more intensely because of issues of integrity, honesty, decency, truth, justice. You have to choose ways of being in the world, even when it looks as if you have very little chance of being victorious at the present moment.\n\nYou notice that discourse is shifting from poverty to diversity. Why do you see that as a problem?\n\nIt\u2019s neoliberalism, which is this obsession with smartness and richness and bombs dropped on other parts of the world and sometimes bombs dropped here. It tends to put the stress much more on access to middle-class status and making that access more diverse\u2013\u2013rather than attacking poverty, ensuring jobs with a living wage, quality education, single-payer healthcare. So the shift from attacking poverty\u2013\u2013let\u2019s say Martin King in 1968\u2013\u2013to this obsession with diversity that you\u2019re getting in the Supreme Court in relation to affirmative action, was a dilution and a domesticating of the issue.\n\nOne of the ways of making sure you sanitize any talk about racism is to talk about diversity.\n\nYou write that the \u201cBlack managerial and middle class must take responsibility for too often being callous and indifferent to its Black poor and working class citizens.\u201d Can you explain that a little more?\n\nWe lost sight of attacking issues of poverty, class\u2013\u2013with the death of Martin\u2014and moved into an obsession with having black faces in high places. As long as we had those black faces in high places, the poor could live symbolically through them, vicariously through them. Or those black faces themselves, middle class and upper middle class, could claim that somehow they were the index of progress. Whereas the real index of progress is ensuring that when you\u2019re living in poverty, you have a quality education for everybody\u2013\u2013not ensuring you have more kids at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.\n\nNow it\u2019s a beautiful thing when you\u2019ve got black kids at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, but if that\u2019s your index of progress, then we forget about the masses of everyday black people.\n\nThank God we\u2019ve got William Barber and Liz Theoharis leading the poor people\u2019s campaign during the Trump years, but the issue of focusing on poverty is something that ought to hold across the board if we are to have any moral authority. Same is true in terms of Martin Luther King Jr.: concerned about bombs dropped in Vietnam killing Vietnamese babies. He knew he was going to be unpopular, but he had to preserve his moral integrity. So it is with the drone strikes. Under Bush, we had what? 53 drone strikes. That was a war crime because they were killing innocent people.\n\nYou got more than 550 under President Obama, and [the C.I.A.] said, \u201cWe have not killed one civilian.\u201d It turns out they were lying. Those are war crimes, too, but we lose our moral authority as a people and as a movement if all we can engage in is strategic language rather than serious moral critique of evil and injustices.\n\nPresident Obama represented a symbol of the highest achievement for a Black American. Is there a danger of complacency by reading too much into his election and forgetting everything that needs to be done to improve race relations?\n\nIt\u2019s very clear that under Obama, you had a bonanza for black middle-class folk that had careers in the academy. Who got books. Who got careers on TV. Who got jobs. Remember all the black folk who were on TV under Obama? They were doing very well, but the black poor or the black working class was still getting devastated. See, the police were still going after them. They were privatizing schools under Arne Duncan, Obama\u2019s secretary of education. They were tightening up national security and surveillance to keep track of different folks. Only one Wall Street criminal went to jail. You can see how twisted the rule of law was.\n\nThe black middle classes are celebrating because they had the black face with the highest place, The White House, so they\u2019ve got access to diversity jobs and so on. Magazines, TV, newspapers hiring black folk like I don\u2019t know what. What I call the \u201crent a Negro\u201d phenomenon. They wouldn\u2019t last that long, which [they haven\u2019t]. Look on TV now\u2013\u2013you hardly see any black people. You ended up with this upper middle class renaissance, but our poor and working class were forgotten. When Tavis [Smiley] and I raised the issue of poverty and poor people, it looked like we were hating Obama, as opposed to loving black poor people.\n\nIt was cast in personal terms rather than cast in the moral terms of, as a people, we, at our best, [have] always been concerned about all of us\u2013\u2013not just the top, highly successful ones. I have nothing against black success, but I can\u2019t stand black success when it generates an indifference toward black poor people.\n\nYou write that you worry about academics maintaining a critical perspective while still maintaining an allegiance to the institution. Can you talk about that boundary?\n\nWell, the best of the academy is a love of truth, goodness, and beauty. The worst of the academy is the commodification of the academy, the marketization of the academy. It becomes nothing but careerism and opportunism. That\u2019s true for anybody in the academy, not just black people. We\u2019ve seen the academy become so thoroughly corporatized that it\u2019s very much market-driven. It makes it difficult to make sure we\u2019re committed to deep education as opposed to just market-driven schooling. And there\u2019s the connection between the academy and television, radio, social media, where everybody\u2019s for sale.\n\nTherefore, the sellout becomes the norm. People can\u2019t wait to sell themselves because they can\u2019t wait to be visible and highly public. We end up losing a lot of serious moral substance, integrity, honesty, and courage. Why? Because people want popularity. Integrity is pushed back.\n\nI\u2019ve been very blessed 40 years in the academy. But I certainly intend on being true to my calling, not just my career. I\u2019ve been trying to tell the truth about the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department, Harvard, Yale, Princeton. The truth about anything. The Black church, the black bourgeoisie. I\u2019m not perfect, so I fall on my face like everybody else. But that\u2019s what it is to be part of the legacy of the Martin Luther King, Junior and Fannie Lou Hamers. Of John Coltrane, Curtis Mayfield, Nina Simone. Black musicians set the standard. Radical freedom and love; radical love and freedom.\n\nWhat do you see as the role of race in the election of Trump?\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the vicious legacy of white supremacy was a major factor in the Trump victory. The major factor, but not the only factor. The other factor was the neoliberal policies that allowed for a massive redistribution of wealth from poor and working people to the top one percent. People were hungry for a populist message.\n\nThen Trump comes along with a pseudo-populist message, tied to white supremacy, but also tied to male supremacy. The issue of misogyny in this election is fundamental. It amazes me how people could talk as if it\u2019s all about racism and not say a mumbling word about patriarchy. Patriarchy played a very important role. Homophobia and transphobia, too. That\u2019s not to downplay racism\u2013\u2013but it\u2019s not the only factor.\n\nIssues of class are very important. The issue of homophobia is very important. And, in foreign policy, this imperial machismo identity that Trump had played an important role.\n\nDo you see parallels between the Black movement and the women\u2019s movement? How do they inform each other?\n\nThe similarity between white supremacy and male supremacy is that you have elites who think they can do anything and treat anybody anyway they want with no accountability, no answerability, no responsibility. With sexual harassment, what you have is this misogyny, patriarchy, in which men are treating women as if they can do anything they want with no accountability at all and get away with it year in, year out, decade in, decade out. And they got caught. Thank God for voices that call for accountability. You see all these intellectuals, actors, politicians across the board because we know patriarchy shot through every institution in our society.\n\nWell, male supremacy and white supremacy are the same. You treat black people, brown people, red people, anyway you want and can get away with it. No responsibility. And Trump is the symbol of that. If anybody is a gangster, to be a gangster is to exercise arbitrary power over others in an abusive way and get away with it; to feel as if there\u2019s no accountability, no answerability, no responsibility. Trump is the ultimate American gangster right now. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\n\nMovements like Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement sprung up and have been facilitated by social media. What does it take for these to be successful and long-lasting?\n\nThe movement for black lives now [includes] more than 40 organizations. You\u2019ve got many standing committees throughout the country meeting regularly. We had a wonderful gathering in Boston just a few weeks ago\u2013\u2013not a lot of visibility but still very much consolidating, solidifying. Same with Standing Rock, with our indigenous brothers and sisters, continually organizing\u2013\u2013not just around the pipeline, but around a variety of different issues trying to preserve sacred land and the respect of indigenous peoples.\n\nSame with the feminist movement from below. In January, [it was] very much corporate feminists. Then in March, feminism [came] from below\u2013\u2013poor women, working class women, lesbians, trans, and others, that those movements are trying to institutionalize. They are very much alive, and they\u2019re the ones to keep an eye on because they\u2019re getting at the most fundamental issues and willing to pay the major costs.\n\nYour great-great uncle was lynched when you were just nine years old and hung in an American flag. Colin Kaepernick recently made waves by refusing to salute the flag\u2013\u2013a gesture meant to bring light to the oppression of Black Americans. What are your own feelings about the flag?\n\nI want to salute brother Colin and brother Eric and the others\u2013\u2013those courageous, visionary athletes\u2013\u2013to make this issue a crucial one. I am first and foremost a Christian. For me, every flag is under the cross. So often, the flag becomes an idol to worship or fetishize, to defer before\u2013\u2013whereas for a Christian like me, the cross signifies unarmed truth, unconditional love. The flag is always a national symbol, and that national symbol is under unconditional truth, unconditional love\u2013\u2013so the cross is always a critique of the flag. I never really thought that the flag required my uncritical allegiance.\n\nI acknowledge that the flag has been a symbol that people have been willing to live and die for, in the name of the nation. And that\u2019s a beautiful thing, relative to what the causes in the war are. Some wars are unjust, you know. But without that unarmed truth and unconditional love, you end up with a narrow nationalism, a chauvinism, a form of idolatry that worships a nation rather than worships, for me, a God, as a Christian.\n\nWe\u2019re at such a deeply divided time in our country. The two political camps cannot seem to agree on facts or understand each other. How can we bridge the divide?\n\nCommit to acknowledging that each and every human being is made in the image of God, regardless of what evil choices they make; that there\u2019s still something that\u2019s worthy of a person being treated with love no matter how cruel they are. That doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t count on their evilness and keep track of their evilness, but it doesn\u2019t preclude or foreclose your ability to stay in contact with their humanity. Also, everybody has a capacity to change. They don\u2019t have to be frozen at the moment. A young gangster like Malcolm Little can become a great prophetic voice in 20th century America called Malcolm X\u2013\u2013but it\u2019s all love that does that. Love can play a fundamental role in changing people from gangsters to freedom fighters.\n\nYou\u2019ve been critical of Ta-Nehisi Coates, saying that he is an example of trying to \u201cfit into\u201d the neoliberal establishment. Can you explain your criticism of his work?\n\nHis third book begins with the good negro government, with the reconstruction governments, and goes directly to Obama as an example of good negro government. I\u2019m critical of that formulation precisely because you got war crimes in the form of drone strikes. One percent of the population got 95 percent of the income growth the first four years of the Obama administration. You had a refusal to focus on the new Jim Crow for seven years, and Wall Street got off scot free, with no criminal going to jail, with free money, interest free, for three years, but students have to pay interest rates and bail out Wall Street (and not bail out Main Street). Now, if that\u2019s good negro government, I\u2019m still critical of it.\n\nOn page 103 in [Coates\u2019] text, he says that Barack Obama is a culmination of Malcolm X\u2019s legacy, and there\u2019s another figure that one can talk about\u2013\u2013how he is our shining Black prince. It\u2019s a flagrant misreading of black history. Barack Obama is in no way the culminating moment of Malcolm X\u2019s legacy, and I\u2019ll fight over that \u2018til the day I die.\n\nThat\u2019s a larger discussion. I\u2019d like to sit down and talk to the brother. Don\u2019t allow anybody to think that a moderate neoliberal head of an American empire is the culminating moment of one of the greatest critiques of White supremacy and capitalism and the American empire, Malcolm X. Barack Obama\u2019s relation to Malcolm X is about as tight as the relation of John Coltrane to some bluegrass singer. Just because they\u2019re the same color doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re in the same trajectory.\n\nDo you think that Obama\u2019s unique position made his race more salient? He couldn\u2019t just be a president, but he was seen to be a Black president or representative? So there was no other way to even look at him, where people felt like they had to choose a side?\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely right. He\u2019s head of a white supremacist empire, but the important thing is if all you see is his color, and you don\u2019t see his policies to what\u2019s going on with those drone strikes in Somalia and Yemen and Pakistan, if you don\u2019t see the Wall Street friendly people coming, the Tim Geithners and Larry Summers, who are running his economic team. If you don\u2019t see [Joel] Brenner, who\u2019s coming out of Bush\u2019s counter-terroristic group and heading Obama\u2019s counter-terroristic group, if you don\u2019t see those continuities and all you\u2019re seeing is skin color, then you\u2019re missing much of the picture. It\u2019s not just white supremacy. It\u2019s white supremacy situated in a relation to empire predatory capitalism, patriarchy, homophobia, transphobia, and it\u2019s not just ideological. It\u2019s a matter of the truth, and you\u2019re going to mislead people if you think that it\u2019s all about race.\n\nAt one point, brother Coates says Obama was such a deeply moral human being and one of the great Presidents, and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cBut what is your definition of morality, because he assassinated three American citizens with no due process?\u201d\n\nIf George Bush did that, he wouldn\u2019t say that. But [Obama is] a black man. He\u2019s let off the hook. I don\u2019t let anybody off the hook.\n\nYou want to hold everyone to the same standard.\n\nThe same moral standard. Absolutely. That\u2019s what makes Black people who we are. We are one of the greatest peoples in the modern world because we have been one of the most hated people, but we\u2019ve taught the world so much about love and morality. That\u2019s what Martin Luther King, Jr. stands for. That\u2019s what Fannie Lou Hamer stands for. Once we lose that, then we lose our moral credibility and our spiritual integrity, and we become nothing but just folk obsessed with power like everybody else. That\u2019s not who we are at our best.\n\nThe Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, No. 2 (Winter, 1993-1994), pp. 59-67"}, "https://socialistworker.org/2018/02/12/a-strike-for-dignity-and-civil-rights-in-memphis": {"title": "A strike for dignity and civil rights in Memphis", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://socialistworker.org/2018/02/12/a-strike-for-dignity-and-civil-rights-in-memphis", "text": "Fifty years ago, Black sanitation workers in Memphis began a strike that would shake U.S. society and be remembered for generations. Brian Jones tells the story.\n\nON FEBRUARY 1, 1968, two sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, were riding on the back of a garbage truck when the compactor accidentally activated.\n\nThey were part of a five-man crew, but only three fit in the cabin of the truck, so two had to ride on the back. Bad weather forced them to seek shelter closer to the opening of the compactor.\n\nThe driver heard screams, but by the time he stopped the truck and tried to halt the compressor, it was all over. One man was crushed instantly. The other had nearly escaped, but his coat got caught, and the compactor pulled him in. Both men were chewed up, like garbage.\n\nThe deaths of Cole and Walker set off a chain reaction of events--including a strike by the city's 1,300 sanitation workers and the participation of Martin Luther King Jr. that ended with his assassination on a Memphis hotel balcony--that have profound implications for the still-unresolved struggle against racism and exploitation.\n\nLittle did the striking sanitation workers know \"that their decision would challenge generations of white supremacy in Memphis and have staggering consequences for the nation,\" as Michael K. Honey put it in his book Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King's Last Campaign.\n\nSANITATION WAS a \"Black\" job--meaning the conditions were terrible, the pay was low, and workers had no rights and no union. White supervisors belittled and demeaned Black sanitation workers in countless ways--calling a 72-year-old man \"boy,\" for example.\n\nWorkers could be fired for any reason, and their pay could be docked by supervisors on a whim. \"Before the union, it was whatever they decided they wanted to pay you,\" one worker, James Robinson, recalled. \"I wasn't making a damn thing. You can't pay the light bill on no 96 cents an hour.\"\n\nIn 1968, after 15 years on the job, he was making just $1.65 an hour--five cents more than the federal minimum wage. Sanitation workers could regularly put in a 40-hour workweek and still qualify for welfare.\n\nIt was difficult work. Fifty-gallon drums of garbage, covered or uncovered and filled with refuse of all kinds, had to be hauled from wherever their owners left them over to the truck, and then hoisted into the back for the compactor.\n\n\"Not only white supervisors, but also white citizens,\" Honey wrote, \"had disdainful attitudes toward Black sanitation workers.\" Homeowners were not required to even use the drums or garbage cans, yet garbage workers were required to pick up everything as it lay. Piles of grass, branches, papers, boxes, even dead animals they found in the road--all had to be removed by the sanitation workers.\n\nOutmoded, dirty trucks with faulty wiring--such as the one Cole and Walker rode--were common, adding to the physical danger of the job.\n\nThe 1968 strike didn't emerge from nowhere. Organizers had laid the groundwork for years, but were repeatedly frustrated and fell short of their goals.\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, sanitation workers who were military veterans and had some experience organizing in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) began trying to organize their co-workers in Memphis.\n\nThe most successful of these was T.O. Jones, the leader of what later became AFSCME Local 1733. Jones solicited support from civil rights activists, Black ministers and, to some extent, AFSCME's national office, but never recruited a majority of sanitation workers to paying dues.\n\n\"Although he had no training,\" Honey noted, \"Jones understood the first principle of union organizing: that the workers themselves had to take action. He talked to them constantly about their need for a union and their own ability to do something about it.\"\n\nIn 1966, Jones had organized 500 workers who were ready to strike, but he called off the walkout at the last minute in the face of a well-prepared scabbing operation ready to replace the workers and a court-ordered injunction against the strike.\n\nAfter many years of organizing, Jones had only about 40 workers paying dues by 1968--and the mayor refused to negotiate on principle.\n\nTHE DEATHS of Echol Cole and Robert Walker created a new situation: the sanitation workers were now ready to act en masse. After pushing at the front for so long, T.O. Jones now had to run to catch up.\n\nJones organized a meeting at the Memphis Labor Temple on February 11, and hoped that if 500 showed up, he might have leverage to get negotiations going. Instead, somewhere between 700 and 900 arrived, and by 11 p.m., when they realized that the city would not negotiate, the sanitation workers shouted for a strike.\n\nThey had no leaflets, no treasury and no plan. \"This was a strike that we called,\" a veteran trash collector would remember. \"Labor didn't call it. We called it.\" Their demands were simple: a living wage, improved safety standards and union recognition. The next day, February 12, the strike began.\n\nThe sanitation workers quickly reached out to civil rights activists and clergy for support and solidarity. When the NAACP got involved, \"alarm bells went off in white Memphis.\"\n\nThe workers actually avoided making the strike an explicit \"racial\" issue at first, but their treatment at the hands of the police and the mayor was blatantly racist. Other city employees had unions--why not the all-Black sanitation workers?\n\nAgain and again, the intransigence of the mayor galvanized the strikers to press on with their struggle. Threats, intimidation, police violence and court injunctions no longer scared people back to work. Rather, they deepened the workers' resolve and widened support for their cause.\n\nStriking workers didn't sit at home. They kept up morale, momentum and pressure through mass action that included daily midday mass union meetings of nearly 1,000 workers, followed by marches into the downtown area, followed by mass meetings with community members in Black churches.\n\nThe slogan they later carried on placards, \"I Am a Man,\" communicated the multiple layers of meaning behind the strike: Black sanitation workers were fighting for recognition as human beings.\n\nFor the mayor to enter into negotiations would require acknowledgement of their fundamental equality--that the sanitation workers were social equals deserving of the same treatment and consideration already extended to other white municipal workers.\n\nMARTIN LUTHER King's staff begged him not to go to Memphis.\n\nThey feared he would get \"bogged down,\" as he usually did, and they would have to postpone the planned Poor People's Campaign that had already been delayed at least once.\n\nThrough the Poor People's Campaign, King hoped to gather a multiracial coalition of the poor to engage in mass, nonviolent civil disobedience in Washington, D.C. This would tie up traffic and shut down the city to demand that the government take action to end poverty, hunger and homelessness.\n\nThe idea was in keeping with King's analysis that the civil rights movement needed to move on from \"phase one\" (civil rights) to \"phase two\" (economic and human rights).\n\nBut King's allies from the first phase--clergy, leaders of large trade unions, and Northern liberal politicians--weren't nearly as enthusiastic about carrying out the second. King failed to draw any significant numbers to join in planning the Poor People's Campaign. \"There's no masses,\" he complained, \"in this mass movement.\"\n\nThe Memphis strike was different. There, the working poor had organized themselves to demand justice. Their determination and energy had drawn support from local clergy, students and civil rights activists.\n\nIn Memphis, King could do what he probably did best: give confidence and a sense of larger purpose to a mass movement already in progress. The workers could benefit from the greater attention their cause would gain by King's presence, and King could get a chance to make \"phase two\" a reality.\n\nOn Monday, March 18, a month into the strike, King spoke to the sanitation workers for the first time, at the Mason Temple in Memphis.\n\nHe arrived frustrated by his failed attempts to pull together a coalition to get behind the Poor People's Campaign. The sanitation workers he addressed were exhausted by a strike that was dragging on, and enduring weeks of harassment and police brutality. But 15,000 people came out to see King that night--indicating that the movement had spread far beyond the 1,300 sanitation workers.\n\nThat night, King put the Memphis struggle in the context of a national struggle for economic justice and human rights. \"You are reminding not only Memphis, but you are reminding the nation that it is a crime for people to live in this rich nation and receive starvation wages,\" King said.\n\nHe told the Biblical story of Dives, who went to hell because he passed a poor man, Lazarus, every day and refused to see his plight. \"If America does not use her vast resource of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God's children to have the basic necessities of life,\" King warned, to thunderous applause, \"she too is going to hell.\"\n\nAs the tension and energy in the room only grew, King proposed a major step forward for the struggle.\n\n\"You know what?\" he asked the crowd. \"You may be able to escalate the struggle a bit.\" Then he dropped the bombshell: \"I tell you what you ought to do and you are together here enough to do it:...you ought to...have a general work stoppage in the city of Memphis!\" This time, historian Taylor Branch wrote, \"cheers rose into sustained, foot-stomping bedlam, which drowned out further words.\"\n\nMAKING THAT idea a reality proved more difficult. When the day of the work stoppage came, a rare snowstorm kept everyone home from work and school anyway, sucking some of the momentum from the movement. Still, King remained committed to trying again. \"I've never seen a community as together as Memphis,\" he told an adviser.\n\nThe rescheduled mass march turned into a riot--when a group of young people broke some storefront windows, the police used it as a pretext to attack the march with tear gas. One 16-year-old youth was shot and killed at point-blank range by a police officer.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson and the FBI blamed the protesters for the \"violence,\" and the national media tried to scapegoat King. King, his staff and the strikers eventually regrouped, and planned to try again in a few weeks.\n\nOn April 3, King was back in Memphis, and was once again summoned to give an impromptu speech. It would be his last:\n\nProphetically, he spoke about his own death:\n\nThe next day, as he leaned over the railing outside his second-floor motel room, joking with his companions, an assassin's bullet ripped through King's jaw and spine, killing him instantly.\n\nTHE RESPONSE was unprecedented. Black people everywhere took to the streets in huge numbers, in some places looting and setting fires. \"Brotherhood was murdered in Memphis last night,\" Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leader Julian Bond said. \"Nonviolence was murdered in Memphis last night.\"\n\nIn less than four days, 125 American cities, including Memphis, saw uprisings. The president called out 73,000 Army and National Guardsmen, with another 50,000 standing by--the largest domestic military deployment since the Civil War.\n\nThe mayor of Memphis, Henry Loeb, had stood firm against the unionization of sanitation workers through all of this, but after King's death, he began to get pressure from the local business community.\n\nThe national media story about Memphis was no longer about a progressive Southern city, but a backward one, stuck in old ways. Tourism collapsed, and profits were suffering.\n\nBy April 16, the union had a tentative deal--union recognition and collective bargaining, automatic dues deduction with a local credit union, promotions on the basis of seniority, and as of May 1, the sanitation workers would receive a raise of 10 cents per hour.\n\nWe should never forget that King died in a struggle for public-sector unionization--a pillar of economic stability and mobility for Black people in the U.S. and today the strongest section of the union movement.\n\nWe can learn from the fact that King saw this job action in Memphis as central to the fight for human rights. Of all the places where we struggle today to make Black lives matter, the workplace remains the most central."}, "https://popularresistance.org/heavily-armed-left-wing-group-shows-up-at-pro-trump-rally/": {"title": "Heavily Armed Left-Wing Group Shows Up At Pro-Trump Rally", "keywords": ["class struggle", "donald trump", "protests", "rally", "working class"], "url": "https://popularresistance.org/heavily-armed-left-wing-group-shows-up-at-pro-trump-rally/", "text": "The Phoenix John Brown Gun Club showed up armed and ready at a pro-Trump rally\n\nA heavily armed left-wing group, the John Brown Gun Club, made a surprise appearance over the weekend at a pro-Trump rally being held in Phoenix, Arizona with a conciliatory message for supporters of the president.\n\nAbout two dozen men and women armed with a variety of rifles stood beside the march in downtown Phoenix, in order to both show their opposition to the Trump administration and its policies, and to appeal to supporters of President Trump as fellow members of the working class. The group describes itself as largely white and working class, with the ultimate goal of \u201ctotal liberation of all working people, regardless of skin color, religious background, sexual orientation, gender identity, [or] nationality.\u201d\n\nThe gun group laid out its message to the Trump fans in a Facebook post, stating:\n\n\u201cPhoenix John Brown Gun Club went out to the MAGA march at the Arizona State Capitol today, open carrying alongside the Arizona Brown Berets and in coalition with AFA.\n\nOur statement to the attendees of the march:\n\n\u201cWE STAND FOR THE LIBERTY OF ALL PEOPLE.\n\nWe are working class and poor people. We are not here today as your enemies. But Jews, Muslims, migrants, refugees, folks of color, native people, queer and trans folks, the elderly, or others who are now being targeted by the Trump administration are also not your enemies.\n\n We have been fooled and duped for long enough by politicians on all sides. We keep on following the same politicians as they break promise after promise and sell out hard working and struggling folks. Whether Democrat or Republican, they\u2019re always the same: rich politicians who only look out for themselves at the expense of all the rest of us. No matter what lies they tell us about being champions for the \u201ceveryday citizen\u201d or \u201clittle guy\u201d, they all end up behaving the same.\n\n We are now watching as preparations are made to slash the budget for meals on wheels, denying tens of thousands of senior citizens the nourishment they need to survive. We look on as the new administration targets and attacks people merely for the religion they practice. We cringe in horror as the swamp is not drained, but padded by even more corrupt Wall Street swindlers. We stand in shock as the Federal government seizes land from small farmers and home owners to build a massive border wall. Every day another executive order is signed and our \u201clittle guy\u201d president rules with the stroke of a pen, mocking whatever we thought our democratic processes stood for.\n\nMeanwhile, we are so busy attacking each other that we don\u2019t even have the ability to resist the folks actually calling the shots. We who have been attacking the Mexican day laborer rather than the rich CEO. We who have rallied against the construction of new Mosques instead of ensuring all our city\u2019s children have clean drinking water. We who have made public calls to attack and arrest Black Lives Matter activists rather than to investigate and punish billionaires who gut our pensions and health insurance. Striking out at folks who we have much more in common with, folks who should be our natural allies, instead of at those who rig this entire system and profit from our misery.\n\nThe only people who gain from this are the politicians and the economic elite they protect. While we\u2019re busy fighting black folks, migrants, queer folks, and Muslims, our communities crumble. While we work ourselves into a frenzy about Syrian war orphans potentially moving into our cities, our own children struggle to eat. While we attack other marginalized and exploited people, the rich and politicians watch on and laugh at us.\n\nAll people who want real liberty and a better future face a choice. We can choose to continue to attack folks merely because they have a different skin color or religion or sexual preference or gender identity or country of birth than we do. Or we can choose to fight for liberty for all people. We must choose a side, and we must do it now.\n\nWe must defend these targeted communities at all costs. We will not merely watch as our co-workers, neighbors, friends, and families are stolen from us, murdered, deported, arrested without cause, disappeared, and brutalized.

But while the dictatorial nature of the DPRK is unquestionable, the fierce anti-Americanism that sits at the core of the Kim dynasty stems from a clear memory of the US-led war in Korea.\n\nAsk many Americans about the Korean War, and they\u2019re apt to tell you it was where the men and women of the 4077th served , where Dick Whitman became Don Draper , or simply that it was a conflict involving Korea. Ask most people in North Korea, and they\u2019re likely to tell you it was an epochal, earth-shaking calamity that left their country a craterous, barren hell and killed at least one of their relatives.\n\nThe Korean War managed to kill millions, turn into a proxy conflict between the United States and Soviet Union, and bring the world to the brink of nuclear conflict, all in the span of three years.\n\nBreaking out in June 1950, when the Communist north invaded the anti-Communist south, the war drew in the United States after southern forces quickly collapsed and lost the capital, Seoul. Although Korea was strategically marginal, for the handful of US policymakers determined to involve their country, it was the first Soviet test of US power and prestige in a Cold War world. It ended in stalemate and an uneasy armistice that still exists to this day.\n\nThe war upped the ante on airborne devastation, outdoing the already considerable obliteration Allied bombs had visited upon the civilians of the Axis powers during World War II. The world wouldn\u2019t see anything like it again until Vietnam.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. The 635,000 tons of bombs dropped on Korea over three years exceeded the tonnage of explosives during the entire Pacific theater in World War II. By the end of hostilities, anywhere between two and three million Koreans were dead, missing, or wounded; around 12 to 15 percent of the North\u2019s population had been slain. To put that into perspective, the Soviet Union lost roughly 13 to 14 percent of its pre-war population during World War II; Poland, which suffered the largest casualties, lost around 18 percent.\n\nIn other words, US-led forces just about did to North Korea what war and the Holocaust had done to Poland.\n\nThe Korean War proved a fertile testing ground for a variety of sadistic new weaponry, including cluster bombs and nerve gas. There\u2019s even evidence that the US military attempted to use biological warfare.\n\nAs the war progressed, napalm was deployed in raids on population centers, razing cities and turning the skin of innocent civilians into a blackened, pus-covered membrane. A single raid on Pyongyang on August 29, 1952 saw ten thousand liters of the chemical blanket the city. The whole thing was so unseemly that even Winston Churchill \u2014 who had once expressed concern that \u201cpsalm-singing uniformed defeatists\u201d would scuttle his plans to \u201cdrench\u201d German cities with poison gas during World War II \u2014 thought it was too much, calling the devastation \u201ca very great mistake.\u201d By the end of hostilities, the US had coated the country with 32,000 tons of napalm.\n\nThe use of napalm in civilian areas was just one of the restrictions that was gradually lifted over the course of the war. Mass fire raids and attacks on the country\u2019s hydroelectric power system were also deemed acceptable.\n\nThe shift was prompted by China\u2019s entry into the war, and by a change in objectives: by 1951, US forces had given up trying to retake the North and had instead settled on putting the North Koreans through such horrors that they would be forced to negotiate.\n\nAs Gen. Matthew Ridgway, the commander of the Eighth Army, explained, the goal was \u201cnot the seizure of terrain but the maximum destruction of hostile persons and material at the minimum cost to our forces,\u201d using \u201cthe really terrifying strength of our firepower.\u201d Secretary of Defense Robert Lovett gushed that \u201cif we keep on tearing the place apart, we can make it a most unpopular affair for the North Koreans. We ought to go right ahead.\u201d\n\nAttacks quickly became a merciless affair, untethered to any semblance of proportionality or precision. Civilians, combatants \u2014 both were fair game. \u201cOne thing about napalm,\u201d one pilot recounted, \u201cis that when you\u2019ve hit a village and have seen it go up in flames, you know that you\u2019ve accomplished something. Nothing makes a pilot feel worse than to work over an area and not see that he\u2019s accomplished anything.\u201d Gen. Curtis LeMay recalled a crew member telling him after three squadrons of B-29s left \u201cthree blankets of smoke\u201d amid conditions of perfect visibility: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we hit. But whatever it was, we certainly shot the shit out of it.\u201d\n\nEyewitness accounts testify to the desolation the bombing created. By spring 1951, General Emmett \u201cRosie\u201d O\u2019Donnell, chief of bomber command, told senators that \u201calmost the entire Korean Peninsula is just a terrible mess. Everything is destroyed. There is nothing standing worthy of the name.\u201d Supreme Court justice William Douglas said the destruction of European cities in World War II paled in comparison to that of North Korea.\n\nHungarian journalist Tibor Meray reported that there were \u201cno more cities in North Korea\u201d; he \u201ctravelled through a city of 200,000 inhabitants and I saw thousands of [collapsed] chimneys and that \u2014 that was all.\u201d \u201cMost of the towns were just rubble or snowy open spaces where buildings had been,\u201d said one American POW. The Air Force determined that eighteen of North Korea\u2019s twenty-two major cities had been at least half destroyed by the war\u2019s end. Around 75 percent of Pyongyang was leveled.\n\nOne of the more egregious acts took place mere months before the armistice, when the Air Force carried out a series of bombings on North Korea\u2019s dams, one of which was estimated to supply 75 percent of the controlled water supply for its rice production. The staff of the Air University Quarterly Review, the official organ of the Air Force\u2019s primary education center, were positively jubilant.\n\n\u201cTo the communists, the smashing of the dams meant primarily the destruction of their chief sustenance \u2014 rice,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Westerner can little conceive the awesome meaning which the loss of this staple food commodity has for the Asian \u2014 starvation and slow death.\u201d\n\nFood production \u201cwas the only major element of North Korea\u2019s economy still functioning efficiently,\u201d they noted, something the bombing had undone. They went on to describe \u201cthe devastating flood waters\u201d following the wrecking of one dam, \u201cwashing away everything in their path.\u201d\n\nThose images were seared into the memories of North Korea\u2019s people, and their leaders.\n\n\u201cThe DPRK government never forgot the lesson of North Korea\u2019s vulnerability to American air attack . . . and [would] eventually develop nuclear weapons to ensure that North Korea would not find itself in such a position again,\u201d historian Charles Armstrong wrote on the sixtieth anniversary of the conflict\u2019s outbreak. \u201cThe war against the United States, more than any other single factor, gave North Koreans a collective sense of anxiety and fear of outside threats that would continue long after the war\u2019s end.\u201d\n\nIf the Korean War doesn\u2019t take up much reflection space in the US, the North Koreans have never forgotten. How can they, when they\u2019re still digging up deadly ordnance left over from it?"}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-supporters-threaten-union-boss-children-carrier-union-chad-jones-a7462566.html": {"title": "Donald Trump insulted this man on Twitter.

The bevy of data is all available here.\n\nBecause the survey is so extensive, it can drill down on issues that don't feature in regular national polls. Among them are racial attitudes and views of how the races are different from one another.\n\nAnd something happened in the newly released 2016 data: The partisan gaps among whites were as wide or wider than we've seen since the survey first started asking most of these questions in the 1990s. It's not that white Republicans' views of African Americans have dimmed so much as that they haven't kept pace with those of white Democrats. But in some cases, the GOP has moved in the other direction.\n\nThe biggest yawning gap between Democrats and Republicans is on the issue of motivation and will power. The GSS asks whether African Americans are worse off economically \u201cbecause most just don't have the motivation or will power to pull themselves up out of poverty?\u201d\n\nA majority \u2014 55 percent \u2014 of white Republicans agreed with this statement, compared to 26 percent of white Democrats. That's the biggest gap since the question was first asked in 1977 \u2014 though the gap was similar (60-32) in 2010.\n\nThe survey also asks people to rate the races on how hard-working or lazy they are, which allows us to compare whether people rate some higher than others.\n\nIn this case, 42 percent of white Republicans rated African Americans as being lazier than whites, versus 24 percent of white Democrats. That 18-point gap is the second-biggest on record, behind 2010 (19 points).\n\nThe gap is again unprecedented when it comes to intelligence.\n\nAs with the previous question, the survey didn't ask people to compare blacks and whites directly, but rather to rate each race separately. In this case, 26 percent of white Republicans rated African Americans as less intelligent, compared to 18 percent of white Democrats. That eight-point gap is slightly bigger than in 2010 (seven points) and 2004 (six points).\n\nIt's a similar story on interracial marriage; 26 percent of white Republicans say they'd be opposed to a family member or close relative marrying a black person, versus 12 percent of white Democrats. That 14-point gap is tied for the largest with 2010.\n\nThe pattern doesn't hold, though, for affirmative action. The survey asked whether people thought a white person wouldn't get a job or promotion that an equally or less-qualified black person would. While 16 percent of white Republicans that was \u201cvery likely,\u201d 7 percent of white Democrats said the same \u2014 a nine-point gap that is on-par with previous surveys."}, "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38996427": {"title": "Cook sacked over sandwich wins $46K", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38996427", "text": "A Canadian court has awarded a former Burger King cook $46,000 ($35,000 USD, \u00a328,000) in damages after she was fired for taking home a fish sandwich, fries and beverage.\n\nUsha Ram says her manager gave her permission to take home the food.\n\nThe 55-year-old immigrant from Fiji had worked at various Burger King locations around Vancouver for 24 years.\n\nHer boss, Janif Mohammed, fired her to warn other staff against theft.\n\nIn her ruling, Justice Lisa Warren found that the employers acted in an \"unreasonable, unfair and unduly insensitive manner\" and should have considered that Ms Ram would have difficulty finding other employment because of her age, limited education and English skills.\n\nMr Mohammed, who defended himself, says Ms Ram was an exemplary employee, a \"wonderful lady\" and a \"good worker\". The two had worked together since 1989.\n\nAt the time of her dismissal, in January 2014, she was earning $21,000 a year and working full-time. Her husband is physically disabled and she also supports an adult daughter with a mental disability.

The judge also awarded her $25,000 in aggravated damages for emotional distress.\n\nThe incident occurred on Boxing Day in 2013, when Ms Ram asked the store's manager Tayyaba Salman if she could take home some food at the end of her shift because she had forgotten her wallet.\n\n\"Can I have a fish?\" she asked in Hindi, her native language.\n\nAccording to court documents, store policy permits employees to have free beverages during their shift, and a 50% discount on food, but managers were allowed to make exceptions.\n\nIn the end, the judge ruled, the dispute boils down to a misunderstanding over what Ms Ram meant when she asked for \"a fish\". Ms Ram testified she meant a combo meal, Ms Salman interpreted it to mean a sandwich. There is no word for \"sandwich\" in Hindi, Ms Salman told the court.\n\nWhen Ms Ram walked out with a fish sandwich, medium fries and orange soda without paying, Ms Salman reported her to Mr Mohammed. After applying the employee discount, the value of the fries and drink taken by Ms Ram was about 50\u00a2.\n\nOn 30 December, Ms Ram was called into the office with Ms Salman and Mr Mohammed, who accused her of stealing. Ms Ram began to cry, and offered to pay him for the food she took, but Mr Mohammed told her to go home.

Workers will disrupt Board of Supervisors meetings scheduled for those days. Union leaders stated that they assumed workers would agree to no more than a one-day strike, but were surprised when a range of positions, including for an open-ended strike, were proposed. When presented with a choice between a one- or two-day strike, members unanimously chose two days, chanting, \"Shut them down!\" While a two-day strike is a step forward, much more pressure would come from an indefinite walk-out, which may yet prove necessary.\n\nA STRIKE may be looming for some 12,000 employees of San Diego County, who have been working without a contract since June 22.\n\nSticking points between the county and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 221 include wages, health care flexible spending accounts and the county's insistence on creating a new \"Tier D\" inferior pension plan for all future workers.\n\nThe union's proposals incorporate demands worked out with community partner agencies for increased spending on immigrant legal assistance, restorative justice programs, food stamps promotion through CalFresh and more.\n\nWhile the relationship with community partners has sparked controversy among a small minority of Local 221 members, it paid dividends for the union when many partner agencies vocally supported pay and benefits increases for workers at the county's budget hearing.\n\nMembers of the union\u2019s negotiating committee members say months of bargaining have yielded only inflexible \"take it or leave it\" proposals from the county. Worse, successive offers failed to improve on previous ones and included arbitrary deadlines for acceptance, with the threat that the offers would go away after deadlines had passed.\n\nWorkers responded by filing unfair labor practice (ULP) charges and taking an August vote to authorize strike action based on the ULP allegations. A strike to protest ULPs does not require a legal \"impasse\" declaration or cooling-off period. With some 3,000 union members voting--a relatively high member turnout--90 percent approved strike authorization.\n\nWITH A high cost of living, but lower pay than other metropolitan counties in the state, San Diego has accumulated a $2 billion budget surplus. That's over 40 percent of the annual operating budget, as against 15 percent recommended by budget experts and actually held by other large counties.\n\nThus, the County Board of Supervisors is hoarding taxpayer funds, while over 300,000 San Diego families cannot meet basic needs without assistance.\n\nThat poverty is connected to both low worker pay and low utilization of CalFresh, MediCal and other programs that the county intentionally fails to promote and publicize at levels that are standard elsewhere.\n\nAfter the strike authorization results were announced, the county agreed to mediated bargaining, raising hopes that officials respected the possibility of union action. But on August 22\u2014after what Tracey Carter, the county chapter president of SEIU 221, described as \"three intense days\"\u2014the county withdrew from mediation.\n\nThough the union negotiating committee has authorization to call members out on strike at any time, it has promised to give the county 10 days' notice before any strike. An \"emergency\" contract action team meeting for workers has been called for August 29.\n\nSan Diego County workers last struck in 1994--a one-day strike that won a three-year contract with raises of 8 percent, 5 percent and 5 percent. Thus, the county may wager that workers have lost the courage and organization to strike effectively.\n\nIn a fairly conservative military county, under a Trump presidency and with Supreme Court considering a potentially disastrous decision in the Janus v. AFSCME case--which could devastate public-sector unions by limiting their power to collect dues--county officials apparently see no reason to break with their longstanding business-friendly miserliness.\n\nThe stakes are high for county workers. An inadequate deal for members in an already low-membership union, with the Janus decision potentially limiting dues collection, could precipitate a downward spiral for the local.\n\nYet a large turnout of 1,000 Local 221 members at the county's budget hearing and 400 at the union's \"Strike School,\" in addition to the strike vote numbers, demonstrate that we are riding a wave of worker anger.\n\nIn a strike, the community partners could help us win broad public sympathy at a time of popular backlash against income inequality. No strike can ever guarantee victory, but it would be more dangerous still--for ourselves, our families and for future generations of county workers--to back down and accept anything less than the

local man Simon Goldinger, 23, confirmed Thursday that he only plans to wait tables until the fundamental structure of the American economy undergoes a complete overhaul.\n\nGoldinger, who started working as a server at the Whitecap Grill shortly after graduating college last spring, told reporters he took the job in order to make ends meet while he waits for the entire economic framework of the United States to be reorganized at the most basic level, creating a sufficient number of adequately paid opportunities for individuals with his level of education and experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be a waiter forever, just until the nation\u2019s job market becomes less reliant on service-sector positions, and a robust, knowledge-based economy can be built from the ground up and given time to flourish, generating more promising career paths that ensure long-term financial stability for members of the workforce like me,\u201d Goldinger said as he scoured several job-listing websites for signs of an unprecedented transformation in the country\u2019s economic foundations. \u201cI\u2019ve been working at Whitecap for about a year now, but once America goes through some massive fiscal changes and retools itself to an extent unseen since the Second World War, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have some better options.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case, this will do for now,\u201d he added.\n\nGoldinger explained that he is comfortable working at the restaurant for the time being, as his wages and tips are just enough to pay his bills and cover his share of the rent on the small apartment he shares with two friends while he awaits groundbreaking changes in the labor policies of developing countries, such as onsite safety measures, minimum wage laws, and overtime policies that, if instituted and expanded over the course of years, might eventually make it cost-effective for American companies to move jobs back home, thus allowing him to find a more secure, salaried position.\n\nWhile conceding he had hoped to achieve more professional success by this time in his life, the Virginia native said he will just have to keep looking and trust that the current system through which resources are distributed, with the vast majority of wealth flowing to the richest 1 percent of the population instead of being reinvested in the middle class to create sustainable job growth and boost the standard of living, will be completely upended at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cWaiting tables is just a temporary thing for me, so hopefully it\u2019s just a matter of time before the exponential gains in productivity from increased automation stop creating redundancies in the labor force and the job offers start rolling in,\u201d said Goldinger, who has on numerous occasions texted his friends to ask if they had heard of any game-changing disruptions to the economic status quo capable of reinventing the role workers like him will play in American life for generations to come. \u201cHonestly, though, hanging around here and serving people food isn\u2019t the worst way to get by while I wait for the federal government to renegotiate trade agreements so they include enforcement mechanisms that require all participating nations to protect the rights of workers while simultaneously streamlining our own domestic corporate tax policies and regulatory structure, thereby ensuring that an advanced industrial country like the U.S isn\u2019t at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOnce that happens, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d\n\nAt press time, sources confirmed Goldinger was applying to graduate school, hoping that by the time he finishes another degree, a revolutionary full-scale reorientation of the nation\u2019s job market will allow him to earn enough money to pay back his crushing student loan debt."}, "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39731085": {"title": "Trump's 'criminal alien'

The goal, Yates wrote, is \u201creducing \u2014 and ultimately ending \u2014 our use of privately operated prisons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security,\u201d Yates wrote.\n\n[The Justice Department\u2019s memo announcing the end of its use of private prisons]\n\nWhile experts said the directive is significant, privately run federal prisons house only a fraction of the overall population of inmates. The vast majority of the incarcerated in America are housed in state prisons \u2014 rather than federal ones \u2014 and Yates\u2019 memo does not apply to any of those, even the ones that are privately run. Nor does it apply to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Marshals Service detainees, who are technically in the federal system but not under the purview of the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThe directive is instead limited to the 13 privately run facilities, housing a little more than 22,000 inmates, in the federal Bureau of Prisons system. The facilities were meant mainly to house inmates who are mostly low security, \u201ccriminal alien\u201d men with 90 months or less time remaining on their sentences, according to a recent Department of Justice Inspector General report. Yates said the Justice Department would review the contracts for those facilities as they come up for renewal, as all will do in the next five years. She said they would then be reduced or allowed to expire, though none would be terminated prematurely.\n\nStill, the memo could spark broader change in the prison system.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge deal. It is historic and groundbreaking,\u201d said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project. \u201cFor the last 35 years, the use of private prisons in this country has crept ever upward, and this is a startling and major reversal of that trend, and one that we hope will be followed by others.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inspector general last week released a critical report concluding that privately operated facilities incurred more safety and security incidents than those run by the federal Bureau of Prisons. The private facilities, for example, had higher rates of assaults \u2014 both by inmates on other inmates and by inmates on staff \u2014 and had eight times as many contraband cellphones confiscated each year on average, according to the report.\n\nDisturbances in the facilities, the report said, led in recent years to \u201cextensive property damage, bodily injury, and the death of a Correctional Officer.\u201d The report listed several examples of mayhem at private facilities, including a May 2012 riot at the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi in which 20 people were injured and a correctional officer killed. That incident, according to the report, involved 250 inmates who were upset about low-quality food and medical care.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that private prisons don\u2019t compare favorably to Bureau of Prisons facilities in terms of safety or security or services, and now with the decline in the federal prison population, we have both the opportunity and the responsibility to do something about that,\u201d Yates said.\n\nThe problems at private facilities were hardly a secret, and Yates said Justice Department and Bureau of Prisons officials had been talking for months about discontinuing their use. Mother Jones recently published a 35,000-word expos\u00e9 detailing a reporter\u2019s undercover work as a private prison guard in Louisiana \u2014 a piece that found serious deficiencies. The Nation magazine wrote earlier this year about deaths under questionable circumstances in privately operated facilities.\n\n[Are private prisons better or worse than public prisons?]\n\nIt is possible the directive could face resistance from those companies that will be affected. In a statement Thursday, Jonathan Burns, a spokesman for Corrections Corporation of America, criticized the Inspector General\u2019s report, saying it had \u201csignificant flaws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report\u2019s authors freely admit that they \u2018were unable to evaluate all of the factors that contributed to the underlying data,\u2019 and they failed to account for the impact of elements such as population demographics or the scope and efficacy of efforts to mitigate contraband,\u201d Burns wrote. \u201cThe findings simply don\u2019t match up to the numerous independent studies that show our facilities to be equal or better with regard to safety and quality, or the excellent feedback we get from our partners at all levels of government.\u201d\n\nPablo Paez, a spokesman for GEO Group, said in a statement: \u201cWhile our company was disappointed by today\u2019s DOJ announcement, the impact of this decision on GEO is not imminent. As acknowledged in the announcement, the BOP will continue, on a case-by-case basis, to determine whether to extend contracts at the end of their contract period.\u201d He added that GEO would \u201ccontinue to work with the BOP, as well as all of our government partners, in order to ensure safe and secure operations at all of our facilities.\u201d\n\nIssa Arnita, a spokesman for Management and Training Corporation, said the company was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to learn about the Justice Department\u2019s decision. \u201cIf the DOJ\u2019s decision to end the use of contract prisons were based solely on declining inmate populations, there may be some justification, but to base this decision on cost, safety and security, and programming is wrong,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nYates noted that the Bureau of Prisons was \u201calready taking steps\u201d to make her order a reality. Three weeks ago, she wrote, the bureau declined to renew a contract for 1,200 beds at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico. According to a local TV station, the county sheriff said the facility\u2019s closure would have a negative impact on the community.\n\nYates wrote that the bureau also would amend a solicitation for a 10,800-bed contract to one for a maximum 3,600-bed contract. That, Yates wrote, would allow the Bureau of Prisons over the next year to discontinue housing inmates in at least three private prisons, and by May 1, 2017, the total private prison population would stand at less than 14,200 inmates. She said it was \u201chard to know precisely\u201d when all the privately run facilities would no longer have federal inmates, though she noted that 14,200 was less than half the inmates they held at their apex three years ago, a figure she said indicated the department was \u201cwell on our way to ultimately eliminating the use of private prisons entirely.\u201d\n\n[Private prison stocks collapse after Justice Department promises to phase them out]\n\n\u201cWe have to be realistic about the time it will take, but that really depends on the continuing decline of the federal prison population, and that\u2019s really hard to accurately predict,\u201d Yates said.\n\nAccording to the inspector general\u2019s report, private prisons housed roughly 22,660 federal inmates as of December 2015, though Bureau of Prisons website indicates the total is now closer to 22,100. That represents about 12 percent of the Bureau of Prisons total inmate population, according to the report.\n\nFathi, of the ACLU, said because certain states and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have such a large proportion of their inmates in private facilities, it might be difficult for them to quickly replicate the Bureau of Prisons plan. But he said states typically look to their federal partners for best practices on prisons, and he \u201cwould not be surprised if we saw some states following suit.\u201d\n\nMarc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a practical impact, and then a symbolic impact. I think it\u2019s part of the evolving climate on criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a statement the Department of Justice had \u201cset a positive example for states nationwide.\u201d U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) said it was \u201cexactly what I campaigned on as a candidate for president.\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had said previously she would end the use of private prisons if elected, though a super PAC supportive of her campaign had accepted significant contributions from lobbying firms connected to private prison contractors.\n\nCorrections Corporation of America and GEO Group now run most of the 13 affected facilities. Those companies were the greatest beneficiaries of a three-decade period when the government toughened sentencing for drug offenders and was unwilling to expand the federally-run prison system in step with the exploding prisoner population. CCA and GEO convinced Washington that they could provide the alternative, and both become increasingly reliant on the government for their business.\n\nIn 2015, both companies received roughly half of their revenue from federal contracts. Of that, only a portion comes from Bureau of Prisons corrections deals that will be wound down under Yates\u2019 plan. The companies also have major deals with the U.S. Marshals Service and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Burns, of CCA, noted the announcement only affected Bureau of Prisons correctional facilities, which he said make up seven percent of the company\u2019s business.\n\nStill, traders on Thursday staged a massive sell-off, sending shares in GEO and CCA sliding more than 35 percent. Both companies in recent years have tried to broaden their business \u2014 building re-entry facilities; selling ankle monitors \u2014 but some investors now worry that Thursday\u2019s announcement could set the stage for a bigger pullback from private detention.\n\n\u201cThe bigger question becomes whether this is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d said Ryan Melliker, a managing director at Canaccord Genuity, a wealth management and brokerage firm. \u201cWill we eventually see ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service move down the same path?\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Yates wrote, the prison population began to decline because of efforts to adjust sentencing guidelines, sometimes retroactively, and to change the way low-level drug offenders are charged. She said the drop in federal inmates gave officials the opportunity to reevaluate the use of private prisons.\n\nYates wrote that private prisons \u201cserved an important role during a difficult time period,\u201d but they had proven less effective than facilities run by the government The Bureau of Prisons spent $639 million on private prisons in fiscal year 2014, according to the inspectors general\u2019s report.\n\nYates said it was \u201creally hard to determine whether private prisons are less expensive\u201d and whether their closure would cause costs to go up, though she said officials did not anticipate having to hire additional Bureau of Prisons staff.\n\n\u201cBottom line, I\u2019d also say, you get what you pay for,\u201d Yates said.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nHow Mother Jones went undercover to reveal the ugly truth about for-profit prisons."}, "https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1127800247288213": {"title": "United Voices of the World the union", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1127800247288213", "text": "To help personalise content, tailor and measure ads and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

The project itself was largely a repackaging of far-Right Christian talking points that came out of push back against gay marriage and represents a refocusing of these groups against trans people in an effort to secure a steady cash flow into their organizations in the wake of controversy surrounding trans people using bathrooms.\n\nBut while CitizenGo, the National Organization for Marriage, and others were hoping to mainstream their talking points in the wider culture, instead what they did was create a roving target that led to continous, successful, and militant mobilizations and disruptions.\n\nFirst, in New York, the bus was attacked and vandalized, which took it off the road for several days, knocking it off it\u2019s schedule. By the time the bus was up and running again, it had become both a lightning rod and a laughing stock, generating a social media storm and a negative spotlight.\n\nAs the \u2018tour\u2019 attempted to continue, so did demonstrations and disruptions. In New Haven, people even rented a U-Haul, fitted it with pro-trans signs, and pushed the bus out of the city and stopped it\u2019s rally from ever happening. In Philadelphia, a mass militant confrontation took place, forcing the bus once again to quickly depart. In Boston, protesters surrounded the bus, and in other cities it appears that the stops the bus planned to make \u2013 never happened.\n\nThe #FreeSpeechBus and resistance to it, gives us several lessons.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Right is trying to advance its positions by using terminology often associated with the Left. Instead of a bus against trans people, it\u2019s a \u201cFree Speech Bus,\u201d and you wouldn\u2019t be against free speech now would you? This kind of framing also helps them when their organizers literally seem to openly endorse violence and wholesale extermination of trans and queer people. We see this dynamic continue in their own report of the tour, noting how protesters \u201cassaulted the African American bus driver\u201d in New York, in short using in this context the race of the bus driver as a shield against their larger agenda of white supremacy and patriarchy.\n\nThis of course is not new, and has been the MO of people like Milo Yiannopoulos for years as well as much of the Alt-Right. It has also led to the growth of the far-Right bringing out a wide variety of queers, people of color, and women, who can in turn mainstream their talking points while using their position in society to deflect criticism.\n\nSecondly, the #FreeSpeechBus took another cue from the Alt-Right by attempting to link any resistance to it to a vast conspiracy that united the Democratic Party with anarchists. While they didn\u2019t mention \u201cSoros\u201d or \u201cpaid protesters,\u201d the idea is the same. That political elites control militant foot soldiers on the ground, who do the unwilling bidding of their oligarch masters. They write in their \u2018tour report\u2019:\n\nThe fact that these claims are baseless and untrue and in their article are only backed up by statements made by various Mayors against the anti-trans bus, or the fact that in some cities, Mayors choose to raise the transgender flag in front of city hall, in a symbolic gesture while others were physically fighting the bus itself, is besides the point. The bus organizers furthered these conspiracies because baseless theories are what the far-Right thrives on. They also help take away attention from the fact that broad mobilizations in communities across the US successfully shut down their tour. As always, these talking points by the far-Right play to their base and allow them to write off popular mobilizations and struggles.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that while the Right likes to connect conspiratorial dots between the State and resistance movements as a way to make compelling propaganda to their base, this phenomenon is actually happening in reality on the Right.\n\nBut while we cannot be surprised that the Christian Fascists with the #FreeSpeechBus get the facts wrong, we also should be clear that the mobilizations that happened on the East Coast were a smashing success.\n\nFirstly, the out of the gate militant resistance in New York helped set the tone, placed the bar high for future actions, and also drew attention to the tour and fight back against it. Secondly, the inspiring actions and the diversity of tactics used became an inspiration to other cities who were waiting for the bus to hit their town. This activity also shows once again that combative and disruptive tactics actually bring people into struggle while accomplishing all of the things that liberals claim such tactics scare away.\n\nBy this we mean it galvanized support, it changed the narrative around the bus itself, it created a crisis which forced people to take a side, and it also shifted the terrain of the debate back onto our court. None of these things would have been possible by just raising a flag at city hall and reading a statement against these bigots written by the Mayor.\n\nMoreover, it showed again the necessity of no platform. Meaning, we don\u2019t allow people to promote views which seek to build towards genocide and mass State violence and repression. This doesn\u2019t mean we favor censorship, it means that we organize as a community against social movements which are organizing against us.\n\nWhile the far-Christian Right is still attempting to flex its muscles under Trump and Pence, we can hopefully build on the success of resistance to the #FreeSpeechBus in the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/opinion/fascism-arpaio-pardon-trump.html": {"title": "Opinion | Fascism, American Style", "keywords": ["Arpaio  Joseph M", "Hispanic-Americans", "Discrimination", "Trump  Donald J", "Amnesties  Commutations and Pardons", "Justice Department", "United States Politics and Government", "Race and Ethnicity", "Maricopa County (Ariz)", "Whites", "Fringe Groups and Movements"], "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/opinion/fascism-arpaio-pardon-trump.html", "text": "So how did we get to this point?\n\nTrump\u2019s motives are easy to understand. For one thing, Arpaio, with his racism and authoritarianism, really is his kind of guy. For another, the pardon is a signal to those who might be tempted to make deals with the special investigator as the Russia probe closes in on the White House: Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect you.\n\nFinally, standing up for white people who keep brown people down pleases Trump\u2019s base, whom he\u2019s going to need more than ever as the scandals creep closer and the big policy wins he promised keep not happening.\n\nBut the Trump base of angry white voters is a distinct minority in the country as a whole. Furthermore, those voters have always been there. Fifteen years ago, writing about the radicalization of the G.O.P., I suggested the hard core of angry voters was around 20 percent of the electorate; that still seems like a reasonable guess.\n\nWhat makes it possible for someone like Trump to attain power and hold it is the acquiescence of people, both voters and politicians, who aren\u2019t white supremacists, who sort-of kind-of believe in the rule of law, but are willing to go along with racists and lawbreakers if it seems to serve their interests.\n\nThere have been endless reports about the low-education white voters who went overwhelmingly for Trump last November. But he wouldn\u2019t have made it over the top without millions of votes from well-educated Republicans who \u2014 despite the media\u2019s orgy of false equivalence or worse (emails!) \u2014 had no excuse for not realizing what kind of man he was. For whatever reason, be it political tribalism or the desire for lower taxes, they voted for him anyway.\n\nGiven the powers we grant to the president, who in some ways is almost like an elected dictator, giving the office to someone likely to abuse that power invites catastrophe. The only real check comes from Congress, which retains the power to impeach; even the potential for impeachment can constrain a bad president. But Republicans control Congress; how many of them besides John McCain have offered full-throated denunciations of the Arpaio pardon?\n\nThe answer is, very few. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, had a spokesman declare that he \u201cdoes not agree with this decision\u201d \u2014 not exactly a ringing statement. Yet Ryan did better than most of his colleagues, who have said nothing at all.\n\nThis bodes ill if, as seems all too likely, the Arpaio pardon is only the beginning: We may well be in the early stages of a constitutional crisis. Does anyone consider it unthinkable that Trump will fire Robert Mueller, and try to shut down investigations into his personal and political links to Russia? Does anyone have confidence that Republicans in Congress will do anything more than express mild disagreement with his actions if he does?\n\nAs I said, there\u2019s a word for people who round up members of ethnic minorities and send them to concentration camps, or praise such actions. There\u2019s also a word for people who, out of cowardice or self-interest, go along with such abuses: collaborators. How many such collaborators will there be? I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll soon find out."}, "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/19/socialism-definition-most-searched-word-of-2015": {"title": "Of course 'socialism' was most-searched term of 2015: its ideas fit our times | Kshama Sawant", "keywords": ["Bernie Sanders", "US politics", "US elections 2016", "Hillary Clinton", "Democrats"], "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/19/socialism-definition-most-searched-word-of-2015", "text": "There is a decisive mood of resistance in America \u2013 a backlash to the status quo. The Bernie Sanders campaign for president is capturing that mood, and it is no surprise that \u2018socialism\u2019 was the most looked-up word in 2015.\n\nThe American youth of today did not grow up in the shadow of the Cold War. The vilification of socialist ideas by Republicans anyway only serves, if anything, to pique their interest. Coupled with that is the future most young Americans face: a low-wage job market, proliferation of student debt and an escalating housing affordability crisis. Since the Occupy movement, the dirty word as far as many millennials are concerned is not socialism, but capitalism.\n\nThere is deep anger against gaping income inequality and systemic racism. People are hungry for political alternatives that will serve their interests for a change instead of the insatiable greed of Wall Street.\n\nOur city council re-election victory in Seattle, Washington, this fall is a powerful indicator of the prevailing mood. The first time our Socialist Alternative Party won, in 2013, the political and business establishment did not take us seriously. But we have shown that not only can a socialist win in the US, a socialist can drive the political agenda of a major city. This time around, big business and their political representatives mobilized a massive campaign against us, fueled with large amounts of corporate cash, disingenuous attack mailers, red baiting and red herrings.\n\nDespite the fact that most Democratic party leaders backed my opponent, the majority of ordinary people who consider themselves Democrats supported my openly socialist campaign. We won decisively with 56% of the vote. We set a new record by raising nearly half a million dollars - none of it corporate cash - with a median contribution of $50.\n\nIn 2013, many people voted for me in spite of the fact I was a socialist. In this year\u2019s election, many more people voted consciously for socialist politics.\n\nThe same shift has happened on a personal level. Only a few years ago at social gatherings, saying I was a socialist used to be a conversation stopper. Now, those same people are curious about what I mean by socialism and excited about the prospect of a fighting political challenge to the billionaire class.\n\nWith Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign, the number of people enticed by socialist ideas has increased far beyond Seattle. The avalanche of Wall Street and billionaire cash for Hillary Clinton has not been able to lower the crest of support for a socialist presidential candidate. Sanders\u2019s campaign just made a historic milestone of having raised money from 2 million donors, with no corporate money and with an average donation of $30.\n\nThere are major differences in the history of socialist parties and ideas in Europe compared to the United States \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have the sour tinge the term retains here across the pond.\n\nBut there is great anger in Europe at the vicious austerity and unemployment. Working people in Europe are searching for alternatives to failed and treacherous political leaders and parties. The support last year for Scottish independence among the youth during the referendum, and more recently, the rise of Jeremy Corbyn as a socialist to the leadership of the Labour Party, indicate that working-class people and the youth are looking for a way out of the dead-end of capitalism.\n\nMillions are beginning to reject the rule of the billionaire class and increasingly looking to genuine ideas of socialism. Mass movements of working people will be the critical factor in leading humanity away from a world ridden with war, poverty, refugee crises and climate disaster and toward a society that can use the resources of this planet to deliver a sustainable and high standard of living for all."}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/majority-of-public-support-jeremy-corbyn-s-plans-to-cap-bosses-salaries-poll-finds-a7527381.html": {"title": "A majority of the public support Corbyn\u2019s most controversial idea, poll suggests", "keywords": ["Jeremy Corbyn", " wage cap", " Labour", " UK Politics", " UK", " News"], "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/majority-of-public-support-jeremy-corbyn-s-plans-to-cap-bosses-salaries-poll-finds-a7527381.html", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s recent proposal to introduce a cap on executive wages at firms with government contracts is backed by the majority of the public, a new poll suggests.\n\nResearch for The Independent reveals that the government encouraging companies to introduce a wage cap for bosses earning more than 20 times that of their lowest paid worker is supported by 57 per cent of the public. Just 30 per cent of those surveyed disagreed, however, suggesting the government should not try to set a limit while 13 per cent said \"don't know\".\n\nThe results also found similar responses among all age groups and across all areas of the country, suggesting there is a high degree of enthusiasm for the policy, which was floated by the Labour leader in Peterborough. Even among Conservative voters, the proposal is supported by 47 per cent, with just over 40 per cent in opposition. The figure is much higher with those who voted Labour at the 2015 election, at 68 per cent.\n\nResponding to the results, Mr Corbyn told The Independent: \u201cLevels of inequality are grotesque and hurt the economy. While establishment commentators slammed our policy for tackling pay inequality, the public support it because they can see the system is rigged. We offer a complete break with a system rigged by an elite taking Britain for a ride\u201d.\n\nAfter a day of interviews and a major speech \u2013 dubbed a \u201cday of chaos\u201d by his critics \u2013 the Labour leader promised his party would look at introducing the pay ratio cap, set at 20:1, which would impose a ceiling of about \u00a3350,000 in any company paying the \u201cliving wage\u201d.\n\nHowever, the pledge did not go as far as he suggested in an interview earlier in the day. He had told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he \u201cwould like there to be some kind of high earnings cap\u201d but refused to be drawn on what level the cap should be set.\n\n\u201cI think the salaries paid to some footballers are simply ridiculous, some salaries to very high earning top executives are utterly ridiculous. Why would someone need to earn more than \u00a350m a year?\u201d he added. Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the leader\u2019s economic advisory committee, said the idea was \u201cidiotic\u201d.\n\nLater, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn attempted to clarify the policy, adding: \u201cHe mis-spoke in that interview. What Jeremy was talking about was pay ratios \u2013 that\u2019s what we have been looking at.\u201d\n\nThose surveyed by ComRes for The Independent were asked whether their view was closer to either Mr Corbyn\u2019s proposal or the statement: \u201cIt is up to employers how much they are prepared to pay their staff and the Government should not try to set a limit on it\u201d. Just 30 per cent agreed with the latter, while 13 per cent responded \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d and 57 per cent thought that the \u201cGovernment should encourage companies, through measures like taxes and government contracts, to cap bosses\u2019 salaries at a maximum of 20 times the company average\u201d.\n\nDuring his speech \u2013 described by many as his \u201crelaunch\u201d \u2013 the Labour leader added: \u201cIn the 1920s, JP Morgan, the Wall Street banker, limited salaries to 20 times that of junior employees. Another advocate of pay ratios was David Cameron. His government proposed a 20:1 pay ratio to limit sky-high pay in the public sector and now all salaries higher than \u00a3150,000 must be signed off by the Cabinet Office.\n\nHe said: \u201cLabour will go further and extend that to any company that is awarded a government contract. A 20:1 ratio means someone earning the living wage, just over \u00a316,000 a year, would permit an executive to be earning nearly \u00a3350,000. It cannot be right that if companies are getting public money that can be creamed off by a few at the top.\u201d\n\nComRes interviewed 2,038 Great British adults online between the 11 and 13 January.

She made a name for herself by turning the EpiPen \u2014 once an obscure injection device for allergy sufferers that she calls her \"baby\" \u2014 into a blockbuster billion-dollar drug. But the 47-year-old has found herself in the hot seat in recent weeks as consumers and lawmakers have expressed outrage over the rising cost of the drug and have called for investigations into the company's pricing practices.\n\nWhile the mounting attacks may be enough to unnerve even the hardened chief executive, Bresch has a longer history than most of dealing with such issues and coming out (mostly) unscathed.\n\nIn fact, Fortune, in a tough profile, once described her career as being full of \"ethically messy mishaps and public relations gaffes.\" At least two involve her own father, Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va.\n\nThe most scandalous incident occurred in 2008 shortly after she was named the company's chief executive and involved the master's degree in business administration from West Virginia University that was listed on her resume. It turns out she never got it. An investigation by the school, prompted by a newspaper report, found that some administrators had added courses and grades to her transcript to make it look as if she had completed the required coursework.\n\nThe incident made headlines across the state because her father was governor at the time and the school's president, Mike Garrison, was a longtime family friend and former business associate.\n\nThe controversy blew over quickly for Bresch, and she remained chief executive, but Garrison and a slew of other administrators resigned from their positions following expressions of no confidence from students, faculty and alumni.\n\nIn 2015, Bresch caused another firestorm when she merged Mylan with a company in the Netherlands. The transaction is known as a \"tax inversion\" and involves joining with a foreign entity to move a legal corporate headquarters abroad. Doing so provides a major advantage: trading U.S. corporate taxes, which at 39 percent are among the highest in the world, for a tax bill from a different country that is presumably less.\n\nSuch moves are so unpopular with the American public that only a handful of U.S. companies have attempted them. Members of Congress \u2014 including her father \u2014 denounced such tactics as undermining the U.S. economy.\n\nThen there's the matter of Bresch's salary and other perks, which are unusually high, even in this era of crazy compensation for company executives.\n\n\"EpiPen prices aren't the only thing to jump at Mylan,\" NBC News reported. According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Bresch's total compensation went from $2,453,456 to $18,931,068 from 2007 to 2015. That's a striking 671 percent increase. That period coincides with the time when Mylan acquired the rights to EpiPens and steadily hiked the average wholesale price from about $55 to $320.\n\nA standard 2-pack now costs between $600 to $700. The price has prompted outrage among many consumers who have taken to social media to complain that they can no longer afford the potentially lifesaving medicine.\n\n\"A trip to the ER is now cheaper. HOW CAN THIS BE??\" one woman tweeted on Wednesday. Actress Mia Farrow weighed in: \"Grandchild w severe allergies needs life saving #Epipen. Cost has soared. Luckily we can pay the $600. Impossible for many scared parents.\"\n\nThe contrast between Bresch's lavish lifestyle \u2014 her signature designer five-inch stilettos for example \u2014 and those of ordinary families struggling to afford the drugs her company sells is a theme that has come up again and again.\n\nWhile many companies have curbed the use of company aircraft for personal business or required executives to provide reimbursement, Mylan has continued to allow Bresch to use one. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported earlier this year that her corporate jet use hit $310,312, including both personal and business trips.\n\nAnother Mylan executive, Robert J. Coury, was called out by The Wall Street Journal in 2012 for having a side business that is a record label that promotes his son's music career and for taking the jet frequently to cities that coincided with his son's concerts."}, "http://www.muslimpress.com/en/tiny/news-105556": {"title": "Interview with Susan Babbitt on Cuba's politics and philosophy", "keywords": ["Washington", "Cuba", "Susan Babbitt", "Fidel Castro", "imperialism"], "url": "http://www.muslimpress.com/en/tiny/news-105556", "text": "Muslim Press has conducted an interview with Susan Babbitt, an associate professor of philosophy at Queen\u2019s University, to discuss Cuba, Fidel Castro, the U.S., and imperialism.\n\nHere\u2019s the full text of the interview:\n\nMP: How do you describe Cuba\u2019s internationalism?

Cuba sent 300,000 volunteers between 1975 and 1991, more than 2,000 of whom died, to push back and eventually defeat apartheid South Africa. In Pretoria, a \u201cwall of names\u201d commemorates those who died in the struggle against apartheid. Many Cuban names are inscribed there. No other foreign country is represented.\n\nThe United States claimed that Cuba was acting as a Soviet proxy but according to US intelligence, Fidel Castro had \u201cno intention of subordinating himself to Soviet discipline and direction.\u201d He criticized the Soviets as dogmatic and opportunistic, ungenerous toward Third World liberation movements, and unwilling to adequately support North Vietnam. Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in his memoire 25 years later that Castro was \u201cprobably the most genuinely revolutionary leader then in power\u201d\n\nUS Intelligence even identified the real motivation for Cuba\u2019s costly involvement. Castro, it was reported, \u201cplaces particular importance on maintaining a \u2018principled\u2019 foreign policy . . . [and] on questions of basic importance such as Cuba\u2019s right and duty to support nationalist revolutionary movements and friendly governments in the Third World, Castro permits no compromise of principle for the sake of economic or political expediency.\u201d In 1991, Cuba\u2019s \u201cgreat crusade\u201d led Nelson Mandela to ask, \u201cWhat other country can point to a record of greater selflessness than Cuba has displayed in its relations to Africa?\u201d\n\nCuba`s internationalism continues. Cuba began exporting doctors in 1963, when Cubans traveled to the newly independent Algeria. After Hurricanes George and Mitch devastated Haiti, Honduras, and Guatemala in 1998, Cuba sent 2,000 doctors and other health professionals. They were replaced by other Cubans willing and able to work where no health services previously existed. After Hurricane Katrina, Cuba offered to send, at no cost, 1,586 medical personnel and 36 tons of emergency medical supplies to the United States, an offer that was turned down.\n\nCuba\u2019s response to the Ebola crisis was no miracle. It has an explanation. It is in the history of ideas \u2013 going back two hundred years. Explained philosophically, internationalism is a practical, not most interestingly moral, obligation. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, who was not alone with this view, believed human beings, like every other part of the universe, are causally interconnected, both with the environment and with cohabitants of that environment. He maintained such a view because he believed in science: Human beings are part of nature. We think, act and grow within networks of cause and effect, dependent upon others. On such a naturalistic view, there is no mystery about why a poor country pursues internationalism: We live well only if others live well.\n\nMP: What\u2019s your take on Fidel Castro\u2019s legacy? How do you analyze his opposition to US socio-political dominance?\n\nSusan Babbitt: Fidel Castro is a man of ideas. He has opposed imperialist ideology, which is also a self-interested view of human beings. Mart\u00ed argued against this view as did Cuban philosophers who preceded him, F\u00e9lix Varela and Jos\u00e9 de la Luz y Caballero. They rejected European liberalism. It should be rejected by activists everywhere.\n\nFidel is not recognized enough for being a philosopher. In Caracus after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was first elected he said people suffer because of \u201cnicely sweetened but rotten ideas ... that man is an animal moved only by a carrot or when beaten by a whip\u201d. That is, we suffer because of ideas about what it means to be human. Marx, after all, thought human beings are distinct from other animals because we care about such an issue: We don\u2019t just try to realize our nature. We need to know what it means to do so.\n\nIn capitalist societies, Marx argued, we suffer \u201cunnatural separation\u201d from our own humanity. We are alienated, not just from others but from ourselves, and from our \u201cspecies essence\u201d. To live well, Marx wrote, we must fulfill our \u201cnatural vocation\u201d for \u201cconscious life activity\u201d and judge it to be a human one: \u201cHuman beings will only be complete when the real individual . . . has become a species being\u201d.\n\nThat means we become real when we understand, and feel, our connection to others, even those far away. In Caracas, Fidel Castro said, \u201cWe are winning the battle for ideas\u2026 They discovered \u2018smart weapons\u2019 but we discovered something more powerful, namely, the idea that humans think and feel.\u201d Che Guevara knew this idea. He famously argued, against the Soviets, that human beings are not primarily motivated by material incentives. Even in the USSR, \u201cnicely sweetened but rotten ideas\u201d were holding sway. Cuba has not followed the same path as the USSR. For this reason, many believe, it did not suffer the same fate.\n\nIn Cuba, questions about \u201cspecies essence\u201d, or what it means to be human, have always been part of the broader, global struggle, for peace and justice. Thanks to Fidel! In a speech on December 2, 2001, months after the attack on New York City, he said, \u201cThere is no more powerful weapon than an individual who knows who she is and where she is going\u201d. Mart\u00ed said knowing oneself, as human, is every person\u2019s most difficult task.\n\nFidel has kept the \u201cbattle for ideas\u201d alive. We, in the rich part of the world, are in desperate need of this battle. Mart\u00ed also writes, \u201cthe only result of digging up external gold is to live without gold inside\u201d. This is a striking claim. It not only suggests that we might not spend our lives \u201cdigging up external gold\u201d, as if we might live better some other way. It is also striking because it suggests the \u201cgold inside\u201d might not be there, that it might be missed. \u201cGold inside\u201d is not whatever we think it is.\n\nThe \u201cgold inside\u201d, meaning humanity, has to be discovered. Indeed, for Mart\u00ed, discovering it is our most difficult task. This is because, like Marx, he maintained that human beings must create the world that creates us. US philosopher Allen Wood notes that many Marxists miss the \u201cmystical shell\u201d of Marx\u2019s naturalism, that is, his vision of who we are as natural creatures within a causally interconnected universe, needing to discover conditions, not just for living a good human life, but for imagining its possibility. It is that part of Marx to which Fidel Castro has remained loyal. Wood\u2019s point is that \u201cMarxists\u201d mostly missed it. Marx said once, \u201cAll I know is that I am not a Marxist\u201d. Marxism, like Cuba\u2019s history and significance, has been distorted. If Fidel Castro were listened to, as the philosopher he is, this would be better known.\n\nMP: What were the results of US economic sanctions against Cuba? Has Washington been successful in imposing \u201cdemocracy\u201d on Cubans?\n\nSusan Babbitt: The US does not know what democracy is. This is known throughout the Third World. When Egypt was rising up in 2011, I heard an interview by a US media outlet with a prominent Egyptian activist for democracy. The interviewer asked \u201cWhat can we do to help you?\u201d She said something like: \u201cGet your own country in order. Stop offering such a false conception of democracy to the rest of us. Your example is confusing, and is destroying the prospects of people elsewhere for real democracy.\n\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was a liberal, a man of the Enlightenment, admirer of Hobbes and Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau. But even Bol\u00edvar considered European and US philosophers na\u00efve about democracy and political freedoms. They were ignorant about the consequences of imperialism, not knowing what it meant to be \u201ceven lower than servitude . . . lost, or worse, absent from the universe\u201d. Bol\u00edvar famously commented that Latin Americans had been sent misery in the name of liberty.\n\nMart\u00ed warned \u201cslaves of Liberty\u201d about the same na\u00efve conception of democracy that bothered Bol\u00edvar. Mart\u00ed predicted political freedoms would not endure without a deeper kind of freedom, rooted in self-knowledge. He went so far as to proclaim, in his influential \u201cOur America\u201d, that the biggest hurdle was not, after all, US aggression; rather, it was that Latin America \u201cshow herself as she is \u2026 rapidly overcoming the crushing weight of her past\u201d.\n\nHe raised a question that would not occur to European philosophers: If one is lost or absent from the universe, how is one known? How does one know others? If one rules the world, one doesn\u2019t ask how the world\u2019s peoples are known. One assumes they are known or one doesn\u2019t care, or need to.\n\nMart\u00ed, as revolutionary, articulated for his region an ancient philosophical imperative: Know thyself. Unlike Europeans, enthralled by what Che Guevara called \u201cthe myth of the self-made man\u201d, Bol\u00edvar, Mart\u00ed , Guevara and of course, Fidel, knew the dehumanizing \u201clogic\u201d of imperialism. They wanted human liberation and they did not take the \u201chuman\u201d part of that concept for granted. This motivated Bol\u00edvar in his drive to transform institutions, and in his insistence on strong central government to do so. It motivated Mart\u00ed, who abandoned liberalism in his youth, and whose independence program, as a result, was a \u201crevolution in thinking\u201d.\n\nMP: How has the US interference in Cuba affected the country?\n\nSusan Babbitt: It has affected the country economically, as is well-known. I don\u2019t have the statistics. The embargo, better known as the blockade, has been condemned by the entire world. Every year at the UN General Assembly, Cuba puts forth a motion condemning the illegal and cruel sanctions placed on Cuba by the US since 1962. The sanctions were tightened after the collapse of the USSR. Every year that vote is supported by even representative at the UN except for the US and Israel and usually a third country such as the Marshall Islands. (Some countries abstain under pressure from the US). This vote gets very little attention in the North American press. Canada supports it every year, even under Harper\u2019s conservative government. How could it not?\n\nBut the greater consequence of US interference, in my view, is that Cuba has not been able to pursue and perfect its model of democracy. Arnold August has done an excellent job (in two books) of researching and explaining Cuba\u2019s model. \u2018Democracy\u201d means rule by the people and Cuba has a system of government, called \u201cPeople\u2019s Power\u201d, expressing the idea of direct representation. It is not our way of pursuing democracy, which may not be democratic in the true sense. Are we really ruling ourselves?\n\nCuba has done things differently. The theory is there and their system can be evaluated according to that theory, which is interesting. It involves not just a view of democracy but a view of human beings and what it means to be one. It has only been 60 years that the Cuban revolution has existed. The world deserves to know the results of that \u201cexperiment\u201d. (Why is our system not called an \u201cexperiment\u201d?).\n\nThere are many Cubans who want the Cuban government to move toward capitalism. This is completely understandable. People want the material goods that they see available in the US and Canada. But they do not always know the poverty of spirit that goes with it. Why is it, for example, that five teenagers in a middle class town in Ontario tried to kill themselves in one day? We know about the suicide epidemic in norther Ontario, rich Canada\u2019s \u201cthird world\u201d, but even in the south, economically developed as it is, children lack meaning in their lives.\n\nIt is not surprising that Cubans leave Cuba for the US. The more interesting question, though, is why so many stay, committed to a new direction. There is an answer to that question that needs to be explored. It has to do with a vision of what it means to live well. But Cuba has not been able to fully pursue this vision because of US interference at every level, including assassination attempts on the leaders. Much has been written about US terrorism against Cuba. Saul Landau made a documentary film called \u201cWill the real terrorist please stand up\u201d. It is only one of many research efforts to bring to light the formidable barriers placed in the way of Cuba\u2019s efforts to take a different direction.\n\nMP: What's your take on the sanctions imposed on Venezuela? How have these sanctions affected Venezuelans?\n\nSusan Babbitt: What is surprising is that the US claim to be acting in defense of human rights is even credible. That they can even make that claim, and not have it laughed off the stage, is an indication of what Noam Chomsky calls \u201cthe depth of imperialist mentality\u201d. The former president of Argentina, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, said that what the US was doing was so obviously directed at \u201cregime change\u201d that it did not need stating.\n\nI do not know all the ways the US has meddled in Venezuela. Venezuela has rich resources. US interference has nothing to do with democracy. John Pilger has made an excellent documentary called \u201cWar on democracy\u201d. Again, the tragedy for the world, is that we may not see the results of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s vision of 21st century socialism. It is no surprise at all that Venezuelans want something different. But there are many who still do not want US capitalism. They do not want to go back to being a US colony. This is the more interesting question.\n\nIn the early 1990s, when I first went to Cuba, the economic situation (just after the collapse of the Soviet Union and eastern bloc) was dire. Cubans were skinny. There was no food and there were daily black-outs. But I heard Cubans saying \u2018We don\u2019t know where we are going but we are not going to turn back\u201d. That was the more intriguing question. I am betting the same is occurring in Venezuela. The future is unclear but many still do not want to return to US domination. These are the views that need to be understood, even if (and I do not know whether this is true) they are the minority.\n\nThe world needs a different direction, rooted in a more sensible and humane vision of who we are. For that reason we need to hear those people, the ones who will not turn back. They are throughout Latin America. They know the history of the hemisphere. We don\u2019t hear their voices in the North. We need to.\n\nMP: How should such subjugated countries fight imperialism?\n\nSusan Babbitt: They should join Cuba\u2019s battle for ideas. Many activists think more abstract \u201ctheoretical\u201d questions are a luxury. There is no time, they say, given global crises, for such ivory tower work. They say all the work should go toward politics and economics. But the latter depend upon ideas. Empirical research is always dependent upon ideas. Political strategy depends upon ideas. This is well-known. Every observation you make depends upon a concept. You see some colours and shape and you see it as an apple. You wouldn\u2019t see an apple if you didn\u2019t know that concept. This is a simple example but the same holds for freedom, democracy, love, solidarity.\n\nEvery act of deliberation, no matter how simple or supposedly private, depends upon general concepts, which are shared. When you think about what it means to live a good life, to be a good friend, to be free, to be happy, you are drawing upon philosophical concepts. The early independence activists in Cuba, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, knew this to be true. They were not revolutionaries, like Mart\u00ed later, or Fidel and Che, but they knew the power of ideas. For the sake of revolution, they argued for the primacy of philosophy in school curricula. They knew Cubans, and Latin Americans in general, needed to know how to think. Mart\u00ed\u2019s independence program is sometimes called a \u201crevolution in thinking\u201d. He knew Latin America\u2019s independence required more adequate concepts. He knew that, as part of the political revolution, they had to displace the \u201cnicely sweetened but rotten ideas\u201d mentioned above.\n\nIn 1998, Fidel Castro said that Cuba\u2019s humanist project explains how Cuba had resisted the US financial, commercial and economic blockade. The explanation is the power of ideas, specifically ideas about dignity, and its practical significance. In 2003, closing an academic conference on Mart\u00ed, Fidel Castro said the only effective response to increasingly sophisticated weapons and an unjust world order is ideas: \u201csow ideas, sow ideas, and sow ideas; sow awareness, sow awareness and sow awareness\u201d.\n\nSome will shake their heads. But philosophers have argued for more than half a century that understanding is limited by expectations rooted in background beliefs. This means that when we don\u2019t believe something possible, we do not see the evidence suggesting it is possible. Challenging accepted ideas, including philosophical ones, makes it possible for people to act and think differently.\n\nMP: How do you compare Western philosophy to Cuban philosophy with regard to human freedom?\n\nSusan Babbitt: There is much to say on this question. Cuba resisted the US embargo. It also defied predictions of its imminent collapse in the 1990s after the disappearance of the Soviet Union. And when Fidel Castro stepped down in 2006 because of illness, Cuba again defied predictions\u2014 this time of internal squabbling and chaos. Julia Sweig, US Rockefeller senior fellow, noted a \u201cstunning display of orderliness and seriousness\u201d and concluded that the Cuban Revolution \u201crests upon far more than the charisma, authority and legend of [Raul and Fidel Castro].\u201d\n\nThat \u201cfar more\u201d is philosophical. It is a vision of what we can be and what we can know as human beings. It predates Mart\u00ed but was most radically realized by Mart\u00ed, who thought political freedoms do not long endure without spiritual freedom. For him, this meant a capacity for sensitivity and humility, needed to respond properly to beauty, whether in ideas, people or events. Only such responsiveness permits knowing the unexpected, which may be humanness. It is a vision, closer to Eastern philosophy than to Europe, that challenges the now deeply entrenched belief, almost impossible to dislodge in the North, that freedom is about having, not being.\n\nEven two hundred years ago, radical Cuban independence activists argued against European philosophy that emphasized individual freedoms. They faced three empires \u2013the UK, the US and Spain \u2013 and the \u201cnecessary evil\u201d of slavery. Like Mart\u00ed later that century, they took the question of dignity to be politically urgent. Threatened with annihilation, they asked how to discover humanness. They wanted human liberation, not the false freedom, consistent with imperialism, being proclaimed abroad.\n\nThe problem is not just that European philosophy, as argued by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, presents a na\u00efve view of human freedom, ignoring the reality of those disqualified from the \u201chuman\u201d part of human freedom. The greater problem is that it does not allow for alternatives, being dominant. US political philosopher, Charles Mills, suggests that there are no alternatives to liberalism. There are alternatives. But they are mostly from the South. Bol\u00edvar articulated a problem that still exists today: Academics talk easily about freedom and equality without bothering to ask how we know the human beings to whom those concepts are meant to apply.\n\nThis includes ourselves. Mart\u00ed took this very question to Latin America\u2019s children at the height of his career. His famous children\u2019s journal, The Golden Age, teaches about dignity. Yet, rather than focusing on Latin America, it offers image after image of faraway places. This is because, for Mart\u00ed, to know and respect themselves as human ends, children must experience sameness between themselves and others far away. They must look outward, not inward, building and feeling connection. Only in this way can real humanness be known, by accessing knowledge beyond \u201cthe Yankee or European book\u201d.\n\nArmando Hart, minister of culture during Cuba\u2019s famous literacy campaign (1961-2), now a renowned philosopher, writes that anyone who cares about global justice in the 21st century should consider the damage done to the world by European philosophy. He has in mind the idea that we live best when we live \u201cfrom the inside\u201d, satisfying desires. It is a view that ignores a reality that Mart\u00ed, and philosophers like him, could not ignore, namely, that the \u201cinside\u201d is a product of the \u201coutside\u201d, which may be dehumanizing. This mattered to Mart\u00ed because he was a liberator. It should matter to those trying to know the world as it really is, not as we expect it to be.\n\nSusan Babbitt is the author of four books, most recently Humanism and Embodiment: From Cause and Effect to Secularism(Bloomsbury 2014) and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara and Global Development Ethics: The Battle for Ideas(Palgrave Macmillan 2014).

That figure gets subtracted from the rest of the bottom half of the world\u2019s population, which collectively has $1.5 trillion in positive net wealth, or more assets than debt.\n\nTo be sure, some people with more debt than assets would not normally be described as \u201cpoor,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThese people may be in debt but be income-rich, thanks to well-functioning credit markets (think of the indebted Harvard graduate),\u201d the report explained. \u201cA number of such cases will exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, in terms of population, this group is insignificant at the aggregate global level,\u201d the report said. \u201cAcross the world, the vast majority of people living in debt really are very poor.\u201d\n\nThe report also said that, based on the rate at which the richest are accumulating wealth, the world may see its first trillionaire in just 25 years.\n\n\u201cTo put this figure in perspective \u2014 you would need to spend $1 million every day for 2,738 years to spend $1 trillion,\u201d the report said.\n\nLast year, Oxfam estimated that 62 people owned as much wealth as the bottom half of the world\u2019s population.

By VIJAY PRASHAD\n\nHURRICANES DEVELOP IN THE ATLANTIC Ocean and move across the cold water towards the warmer sea of the Caribbean. All that energy journeys, picking up steam, driving forward with immense force. This September, hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose, Katia and Maria thrust themselves into the Caribbean and devastated many of its islands as well as the coastline of the United States and Central America. One meteorologist, Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University, suggested that this September was the most deadly hurricane month since 1893.\n\nChanges in the world\u2019s climate, scientists suggest, have made these Atlantic cyclones much more powerful than before. Warming waters increases the ability of the storms to draw in water vapour and to engorge themselves with more energy. These devastatingly formidable storms then drag the rising waters to produce dangerous storm surges that beat against coastlines and produce large-scale flooding.\n\nHurricane Irma, which arrived in the Caribbean Sea in early September, destroyed many of the small islands such as Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda and St. Martin. Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda said that Barbuda, which housed short of 2,000 people, had become \u201cbarely habitable\u201d. The government called for an evacuation of the island, which now has a population of zero. It has been abandoned. This country in the Lesser Antilles or the Leeward Islands faces the brunt of hurricanes since it is in the mouth of the Caribbean. Daniel Gibbs of the government of St. Martin, a French territory also in the Lesser Antilles, said that 95 per cent of the island had been destroyed. \u201cIt is an enormous catastrophe,\u201d said Gibbs, who represents the island in the French parliament.\n\nIrma, a Category 5 hurricane\u2014the strongest possible\u2014struck Cuba with immense force in early September. The storm came fast and hard. The devastation was severe. In the small town of Moscu in the municipality of Esmeralda (Camaguey province), only 10 of its 289 houses remained standing. The Cuban journalist Yaditza del Sol Gonzalez reported for Granma that near Jiguey beach \u201cthe sea took it all\u201d. The storm surge overcame the Malecon sea wall in Havana, sending water into its streets with ferocity. Havana, with its old buildings, suffered from flooding and power cuts. Ten people died, the majority of them in Havana. Cuba\u2019s President Raul Castro took to the airwaves, calling for unity of the nation and for reconstruction of the island. \u201cThis is not the time to mourn,\u201d Castro said, \u201cbut to build what the winds of Irma attempted to destroy.\u201d\n\nBy all indications, the death toll in Cuba was remarkably low as was the devastation to the island\u2019s infrastructure. Certainly, homes in the old part of Havana are brittle and parts of the infrastructure are in severe need of modernisation. But the island\u2019s preparation for the hurricane and the general community spirit that prevails there saved it from total devastation. Tens of thousands of people had been evacuated from Havana in anticipation of the storm, and over a million people from across the island went into shelters. One such shelter was at the Karl Marx Vocational Pre-University in Matanzas, where volunteers gathered food, water and medical supplies for the evacuees.\n\nThe country\u2019s pharmaceutical industry halted production of medicines a week before the storm in order to build up the stock of hydration salts, which were then distributed across the island. Electricity and gas supplies were cut before the storm came to the island, and measures were taken to protect the lines and transformers from the impact of the winds and the flooding. The government made sure to dispatch flour to state bakeries, which worked overtime to produce stocks of bread for the aftermath of the storm. Agricultural workers from Santiago de Cuba harvested their crops before they ripened in the field and distributed the produce.\n\nMeanwhile, brigades and defence councils began to conduct search-and-rescue operations across the areas most affected by the hurricane. \u201cThe most important task is, and will be, the preservation of life,\u201d said Dr Jose Luis Aparicio Suarez, a coordinator of one of the medical brigades. \u201cThe recovery will come later, gradually. Health and life are the absolute priorities.\u201d\n\nBut rebuilding was not left to later. Radio Cadena Agramonte in Camaguey reported during the storm that electric workers had begun to restore power in the area. Within weeks, such workers restored the electric grid, which is not anyway in the best shape. The electric providers reported that the storm destroyed two high-tension pylons, downed 3,616 poles and 2,176 kilometres of power lines, and damaged 1,379 transformers and several substations. Today, almost the entire island has electrical power.\n\nJust before Hurricane Irma hit Cuba, U.S. President Donald Trump renewed the embargo of the island. This means that Cuba will be denied crucial supplies needed for reconstruction, including financial assistance from multilateral organisations. Cuba\u2019s finances cannot manage the reconstruction, but nonetheless the government has announced that its state budget will finance 50 per cent of the construction materials needed for the 158,554 homes that have been affected by the storm. Also, the government has said it will provide a 50 per cent discount on damaged household goods. For those who have had all their goods destroyed, the government has said it will cover 100 per cent of their expenses.\n\nHurricane Irma did not directly strike the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, but it did knock out its power grid. More than a million customers lost access to power and half of the island\u2019s hospitals went offline. This happened without any rainfall on the island and without a direct hit from Irma. Last July, the government-owned power company declared bankruptcy when it could no longer service its debt of $9 billion. There was no money to protect the grid, nor was there money to hastily get it back on its feet. Irma\u2019s strike on Puerto Rico was a warning of what was to come.\n\nTen days later, with the power grid still in distress, Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, struck Puerto Rico. Power went out across the island. Drinking water was no longer available and fuel vanished. The 3.4 million U.S. citizens of the island found themselves stranded in an apocalyptic nightmare. The official death toll was given as 16, although the Centre for Investigative Journalism (School of Law at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico) says that there are already dozens of confirmed deaths, with the toll likely to rise to the hundreds. As hospitals are unable to function, the infirm are under danger of death. Dialysis has been halted; oxygen is not available. The Demographic Registry that certifies deaths has no power. It cannot do its work.\n\nWhile Cuban journalists and brigades fanned Cuba to provide information to the authorities about destruction and reconstruction, Puerto Rico went dark. Communications collapsed and information about the damage was not easily available. While in Cuba the authorities tried to get exact information of the damage done to each home, in Puerto Rico the numbers thrown about were the price tag for recovery\u2014between $40 billion and $85 billion is the estimated insurance claims that will likely be triggered by the devastation. It says a great deal about the different approaches to disaster: one makes sure each person is tended to and the other worries about the cost of the recovery.\n\nPower company officials said it would take at least four, if not six, months for the power to be fully restored to Puerto Rico. This is on territory that is under U.S. government control, although according to a poll only 54 per cent of Americans know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Recovery has been glacially slow. In Aguadilla, thousands of desperate people were given four bottles of water and four snacks. They are starving and frustrated. The price of water has skyrocketed from $2.99 to $10 in many parts of the island. Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of the capital, San Juan, said: \u201cI\u2019m begging, begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying and you are killing us with the inefficiency.\u201d\n\nTrump celebrated the \u201cincredible\u201d job his government had done. \u201cThe loss of life\u2014it\u2019s always tragic\u2014but it\u2019s been incredible, the results that we\u2019ve had with respect to loss of life,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t believe how successful that has been, relatively speaking.\u201d He waived the Jones Act, which prevents ships from coming directly into Puerto Rico without going to a U.S. mainland port. But this will not be enough. Cuba has even offered to send its personnel to the island, but the Trump administration has not acknowledged the request.\n\nHere is a tale of two islands, one a poor socialist state with infrastructure in grave need of modernisation and the other a territory of one of the richest countries in the world. One has slowly emerged out of the chaos caused by a hurricane\u2019s wrath, while the other cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel."}, "http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2017-06-19/we-will-never-sacrifice-our-right-to-build-an-independent-and-socialist-nation": {"title": "We will never sacrifice our right to build an independent and socialist nation", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2017-06-19/we-will-never-sacrifice-our-right-to-build-an-independent-and-socialist-nation", "text": "The Cuban Workers\u2019 Federation and its unions support the Revolutionary Government Statement, in the face of the aggressive speech by the President of the United States Donald Trump, regarding relations between that country and Cuba, and ratify the conviction to stand firm in defense of this genuine Revolution, built with and for the workers, under the leadership of Fidel and Ra\u00fal.\n\nHaving chosen to address relations with Cuba in a setting linked to the invasion of Playa Gir\u00f3n, and treating mercenaries like heroes, constitutes an offense for all those from the most humble ranks of our nation, many of them workers, who defended their socialist homeland until they were forced to bite the dust of defeat.\n\nAs the text issued by the Cuban government expresses, Trump\u2019s words constitute a setback in relations between the two countries, given the threat of rigorously enforcing the blockade laws, conditioning its lifting, as well as any improvement in bilateral relations, on our country making changes inherent to its constitutional order.\n\nBut this backward step does not intimidate us.

We are outraged to hear Trump talk about human rights for Cubans, when on the triumph of January 1959 the Revolution guaranteed the right to work and equal pay for women and men, social security, universal and free health and education, to a dignified life and to civil order. Perhaps Trump intends to prevent, with the restriction on visits by his fellow citizens to Cuba, that they may verify the enjoyment here of those rights that are disrespected in their own country?\n\nWe have a history of revolutionary intransigence, resistance and rebellion, guided by the teachings of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, who knew the beast as he had lived in its belly, and faced with the aspirations of the giant ratified that his sling was that of David, that which we have wielded for decades and against which the hopes of returning us to the neocolonial past have failed.\n\nOur rich tradition of struggle provides us with motivations that inspire us to defend the achievements made and continue to move forward.

In Ecuador the legal minimum wage has been raised to ensure that all waged workers earn a living wage. The minimum wage level reached in 2015 now permits the average household to purchase a basket of household goods and services. This basket, the cost of which is published monthly, is divided by the average number of earners per household (1.6) and is used as a proxy for a living wage.\n\nIn 2007, when the current government came to power, the legal minimum wage covered just two thirds of a living wage. After a series of increases above consumer price inflation, this gap has been closed. Within Latin America, Ecuador is now second only to Panama when it comes to the purchasing power of its minimum wage.\n\nContrary to the belief of some economists, this relatively rapid rise in minimum wage levels does not appear to have carried a heavy economic cost. Ecuador has one of the lowest levels of unemployment on the continent and major employers like the big banana producing and exporting companies have welcomed a levelling-up of wages and other labour standards in the industry.\n\nIn the transition phase, the government had powers to ensure that companies did not pay dividends until they had paid their employees the difference between actual earnings and the living wage level for the year in question. Officials also stress the importance of seeing this significant achievement in the wider context of policies to favour social protection, employment contract security, labour inspection, health & safety and environmental legislation, and the employment of disabled people.\n\nThe banana industry certainly cannot argue that rising wage bills have seriously handicapped growth of the country's second source of export income.

And at just 22 years old, she managed Carter's victorious campaign.\n\nOrganizing as a DSA member means \"I am challenging the root of the problem and not the symptoms,\" she told AFP, speaking at a recent convention of the organization's local Washington branch.\n\n\"I focus a lot less on challenging Trump and a lot more on challenging why he got there in the first place,\" she said, citing forces including economic inequality and white supremacist movements.\n\nToday Smith said millennials -- a generation that grew up during the 2008 financial crisis -- are eager for socialism, to \"embrace the ideology and really fight with it publicly.\"\n\nUnder her management DSA members spent months canvassing for Carter in Virginia's 50th district, about an hour's drive west of the nation's capital, knocking on more than 9,000 doors in the final four days.\n\nThose grassroots efforts helped propel Carter, who ran as a socialist on the Democratic party ticket, to an upset nine-point victory against one of Virginia's most powerful state Republicans.\n\nDespite their current momentum far-left groups like the DSA remain on the fringes of American politics, working within a two-party system that leaves little space for outsiders.\n\nThe political group is not a party, and has nowhere near the clout of sister movements elsewhere such as Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in Britain, or Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain.\n\nBut socialism has not had a voice this loud in American politics for decades.\n\nThough she would not yet classify the wave of leftist activism as a mass movement, politics professor Cathy Schneider of American University said the DSA's growth is significant in that it indicates voters shocked by Trumpism are also increasingly disillusioned with the Democratic Party.\n\n\"There is a sector of American society who feel that the political parties do not address their concerns,\" she said. \"The Democratic Socialists have said we have an answer for that.\"\n\nTheir current strategy does not necessarily include third-party politics; instead the DSA is fielding socialist candidates for elected office using whichever ballot line makes winning likely, generally that of the Democrats.\n\nAnd though many members got involved in the aftermath of the Sanders campaign, organizers now say their goal is to build a movement not connected to any single politician but instead based on core issues like universal health care, public investment in education and housing and bolstering labor protections.\n\nSchneider also noted that socialism's \"alarming reputation\" appears to be fading, no small development in a country that lived through the Red Scare era of anti-communist propaganda.\n\n\"People no longer associate socialism with dictatorships in the USSR and China,\" she said.\n\nThat didn't stop Carter's opponent from red-baiting: in the final days of the race the Republican sent a mailer to 11,000 homes that juxtaposed the democratic socialist's face with portraits of famous communists including Karl Marx and Mao Zedong.\n\nBut even Republican voters told canvassers they found the attempt to sully the leftist's image \"gross,\" Carter said.\n\n\"The scare-mongering around what's essentially a disagreement on economic philosophy doesn't work any more.\""}, "https://www.glamour.com/story/alaska-cops-defend-sexual-contact-sex-workers-arrests": {"title": "Alaska Cops Defend Their 'Right' to Sexual Contact With Sex Workers Before Arresting Them", "keywords": ["sex work", "police"], "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/alaska-cops-defend-sexual-contact-sex-workers-arrests", "text": "There\u2019s a heated debate going on right now in Alaska between the police department and sex workers\u2019 rights advocates over a bill that would make it illegal for police officers to have sexual contact with sex workers before arresting them. If Alaska passes this bill, they\u2019ll become the first state to outlaw any sexual contact between police and the people they\u2019re investigating. Only two months ago, Michigan became the last state in the U.S. to make it illegal for police officers to sexually penetrate sex workers in the course of an investigation.\n\nAdvocates of Alaska\u2019s House Bill 73 and Senate Bill 112 say that police catching sex workers in the act by engaging with them sexually is a human rights violation, and Amnesty International has made an official statement supporting that claim: \u201cSuch conduct is an abuse of authority and in some instances amounts to rape and/or entrapment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's incredibly traumatic to be tricked into having sex with someone who stops in the middle and puts you in handcuffs and takes you against your will to be locked up in a jail cell,\u201d explained Terra Burns, one of the founders of Community United for Safety and Protection (CUSP) , a group of current and former sex workers, sex trafficking victims, and allies working towards safety and protection for everyone in Alaska's sex trade. \u201cWomen have told me that years later they still have PTSD symptoms when they see a police car.\u201d\n\nBut police in Alaska say that if they can\u2019t touch sex workers at all, they have no chance of conducting successful undercover investigations. The problem with the bill, Alaska cops explain, is that their covers will be too easily blown by savvy sex workers who know what officers are and are not allowed to do, and employ a tactic called \u201c cop checking \u201d to sniff them out.\n\n\"(In an undercover investigation) they ask one simple question: 'Touch my breast.' OK, I'm out of the car. Done. And the case is over,\" Anchorage Police Department Deputy Chief Sean Case told the Alaska Dispatch News in a hypothetical example. \"If we make that act (of touching) a misdemeanor, we have absolutely no way of getting involved in that type of arrest.\"\n\nBut this is not the same tune the department was singing when the bill was first introduced earlier this year. The proposed House Bill 73 and Senate Bill 112 would expand an existing law that prohibits sexual contact with suspects already in police custody to include those under investigation. And when they were first proposed, Case said that they were insulting to law enforcement, because internal regulations already prohibit such activity, and, of course, no officer would have sex with someone they were investigating.\n\nIn a letter to legislators sent in January, Alaska Assistant Attorney General Kaci Schroeder stated in no uncertain terms, \u201cIt is neither legal nor acceptable for a law enforcement officer to engage in sexual conduct with a person that that officer is investigating.\u201d She continued to explain that if this were to happen, the officer in question would be fired, decertified, and likely charged with a crime. In sharing this letter with Glamour, Burns made a point to add that CUSP has evidence of several instances of police officers engaging in sexual activity with suspects and facing no charges or disciplinary action.\n\nBurns says that the police department changed its tune about the legality/necessity of sexual contact once the bills started getting some traction, implying that they only supported the bill in the beginning when they didn\u2019t think it would pass. She described Case\u2019s explanation for why the bill will hurt law enforcement as claims that \u201cthey need to be able to have sexual contact with sex trafficking victims in order to rescue them by arresting them.\u201d\n\nBurns\u2019 disdain for the rationale that sexual contact is a necessary element of police investigation of sex work is quite clear, and, apparently, it\u2019s a disdain that the public shares. In 2016, CUSP hired Hayes Research Group to learn what voters think of this issue. The survey showed that 92 percent of voters were not aware of police being allowed to have sexual contact with sex workers during stings and 90 percent thought that it should be illegal.\n\nDespite the efforts of CUSP and the public support for the bill, the Alaska Dispatch News reports that the bills are mired in committee and appear to be going nowhere\u2014and that Anchorage Democrat and State Senator Berta Gardner, the sponsor of the senate bill, has said she\u2019s \"decided to focus her efforts elsewhere.\"\n\nDespite the delays, Burns and CUSP are confident that the bill will still be in play when the 2018 legislative session starts. Legislators are in a special session now discussing the budget, but regular business is over for the year.\n\n\u201cNow that the law enforcement community has stopped lying about the issue and there is more information on the table we expect lawmakers to act to prevent these sexual assaults,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAlaska has long held the shameful title of being the rape capital of the U.S. because of our rape statistics on the Uniform Crime Report, so preventing sexual assault is a strong priority here.\u201d\n\nHow this bill plays out in Alaska may prove to be a testing ground for reform around the country, as this issue gains more attention and recognition. A New York City police officer, Michael Golden, made headlines recently when it was revealed that he allegedly paid for\u2014and engaged in\u2014sex acts with several sex workers while he was investigating them undercover. Golden is currently sitting for a departmental trial; if found guilty, he\u2019ll lose his job.\n\n\u201cThis is a national problem, and Alaska is at the forefront of the solution,\u201d Burns said."}, "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445882/socialism-poll-american-culture-faith-institute-george-barna-tradition-liberty-capitalism?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=nammo&utm_content=socialism": {"title": "Socialism\u2019s Rising Popularity Threatens America\u2019s Future", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445882/socialism-poll-american-culture-faith-institute-george-barna-tradition-liberty-capitalism?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=nammo&utm_content=socialism", "text": "Too many of us have forgotten the lessons of the Cold War.\n\nHeadlines about \u201cthe end of the republic\u201d litter political commentary across the political landscape. They usually mark the beginning of a discussion of the merits of Donald Trump as president of the United States, but his ascendency is not the leading sign of a collapse of American society. For that, see a recent poll indicating a tectonic shift occurring in the political preferences of U.S. adults. When you consider current trends in cultural norms and widely held beliefs, you will see that we are headed toward the end of the American experiment.\n\nThe American Culture and Faith Institute recently conducted a survey of adults 18 and older. It shows not only how deeply divided Americans are on some issues but also how their view of the nation stands in many cases in stark contrast to our nation\u2019s founding principles. Most Americans (58 percent) see themselves as politically moderate, while a quarter identify as conservative, and 17 percent as liberal. Those who were both socially and fiscally conservative, the group tracked by the ACFI in greatest detail, were 6 percent of the population.\n\nBut those differences don\u2019t reveal the greatest divide and danger to America\u2019s future. \u201cThe most alarming result, according to [George] Barna, was that four out of every ten adults say they prefer socialism to capitalism,\u201d the ACFI noted in its commentary on the poll. \u201cThat is a large minority,\u201d Barna said, \u201cand it includes a majority of the liberals \u2014 who will be pushing for a completely different economic model to dominate our nation. That is the stuff of civil wars. It ought to set off alarm bells among more traditionally-oriented leaders across the nation.\u2019\u201d That 40 percent of Americans now prefer socialism to capitalism could spell major change to the policies advanced by legislators and political leaders and to the interpretations of judges ruling on the application of new and pre-existing laws.\n\nHow did we get here? The popularity of Bernie Sanders, whose 2016 presidential campaign was marked by an altruistic spirit and a consistent value system, is of course not the cause of this movement in public opinion but rather an indicator of it. Many Americans have forgotten the lessons of the Cold War and the disasters witnessed in the crumbling economies and failed polities of Communist and socialist countries in the 1990s. Communism was on its last leg, it appeared, and its little brother socialism was not far behind.\n\nLittle did we know that the fires of socialism were being stoked in corners all across America where it is held in higher regard than in nations that have suffered under it. It is obvious where such thinking abounds and continues to spread: in our colleges and universities. The ideologies of professors and educators have proven stronger than facts: The \u201cbenefits\u201d of socialism and Communism are taught from the Ivy League to the local community college. A generation has been taught a lie, and they now believe it.\n\nAmericans who believe in limited government, welfare reform, and states\u2019 rights should look over their shoulder and realize that a dangerous ideology is gaining ground. A crowd that you thought history had left behind is growing. It prefers an America that would look drastically different from what it has been from its founding through the present day.\n\nOne reason that such a dangerous political construct has advanced is that left-leaning activists have hijacked terms of the debate and muddied the popular understanding of political language. Consider that more than 80 percent of all respondents to the ACFI poll said they supported traditional values, as did nearly 70 percent of those who identify as liberal, even if in fact they tend to be socially progressive.\n\nBarna described those who in the poll were identified to be liberals. They are\n\nIt all depends on what the definition of \u201cvalues\u201d is.\n\n\u201cFreedom isn\u2019t free\u201d is inscribed on the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., reminding all who visit of the blood and treasure that has been paid to end tyrannical rule abroad. That America itself may become a socialist country must be abhorrent and foreign to the many who have fought, and to those who still fight, for free markets, traditional values, and capitalist ideals. Conservative and traditionally minded Americans can no longer assume that their neighbor believes what they believe or that he defines the terms of political discourse the same way. The country has changed.\n\nSadly, Barna is only partially wrong that this divide is the stuff of civil wars. In this case, the civil war is fought not directly and openly, with bullets and bombs, but with an intellectual assault on history and facts \u2014 a quiet revolution.\n\nIt is time to play both the short and the long game. Now is the time to speak out and educate all who will hear about the history of this nation and the benefits of traditional values, free markets, and capitalism, which, though not perfect, are better than all the alternatives. Those who love this nation and the ideals of our experiment in liberty must counter the gainsayers in academia and the media or they will soon find that America as \u201cone nation under God\u201d is no more."}, "http://www.marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1918/court.htm": {"title": "Statement to the Court, Upon Being Convicted of Violating the Sedition Act", "keywords": ["Anti-war", " World War I", " War", " Industrial Workers of the World", " IWW", " Wobblies", " Socialist Party USA", " third parties", "  labor unions", " socialism", "  progressive", " leftist", " left-wing", " radical", " economic democracy", " workers rights", "  social justice", " poverty", " Western Federation of Miners"], "url": "http://www.marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1918/court.htm", "text": "Delivered: September 18, 1918 \n\n First Published: 1918 \n\n Source: Court Stenogropher \n\n Online Version: E.V.

I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\n\nI listened to all that was said in this court in support and justification of this prosecution, but my mind remains unchanged. I look upon the Espionage Law as a despotic enactment in flagrant conflict with democratic principles and with the spirit of free institutions\n\nYour Honor, I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the social system in which we live; that I believe in a fundamental change\u2014but if possible by peaceable and orderly means\n\nStanding here this morning, I recall my boyhood. At fourteen I went to work in a railroad shop; at sixteen I was firing a freight engine on a railroad. I remember all the hardships and privations of that earlier day, and from that time until now my heart has been with the working class. I could have been in Congress long ago. I have preferred to go to prison\n\nI am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and the factories; of the men in the mines and on the railroads. I am thinking of the women who for a paltry wage are compelled to work out their barren lives; of the little children who in this system are robbed of their childhood and in their tender years are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the monster machines while they themselves are being starved and stunted, body and soul. I see them dwarfed and diseased and their little lives broken and blasted because in this high noon of Christian civilization money is still so much more important than the flesh and blood of childhood. In very truth gold is god today and rules with pitiless sway in the affairs of men.\n\nIn this country\u2014the most favored beneath the bending skies\u2014we have vast areas of the richest and most fertile soil, material resources in inexhaustible abundance, the most marvelous productive machinery on earth, and millions of eager workers ready to apply their labor to that machinery to produce in abundance for every man, woman, and child\u2014and if there are still vast numbers of our people who are the victims of poverty and whose lives are an unceasing struggle all the way from youth to old age, until at last death comes to their rescue and lulls these hapless victims to dreamless sleep, it is not the fault of the Almighty: it cannot be charged to nature, but it is due entirely to the outgrown social system in which we live that ought to be abolished not only in the interest of the toiling masses but in the higher interest of all humanity\n\nI believe, Your Honor, in common with all Socialists, that this nation ought to own and control its own industries. I believe, as all Socialists do, that all things that are jointly needed and used ought to be jointly owned\u2014that industry, the basis of our social life, instead of being the private property of a few and operated for their enrichment, ought to be the common property of all, democratically administered in the interest of all\n\nI am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions of men and women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence.\n\nThis order of things cannot always endure. I have registered my protest against it. I recognize the feebleness of my effort, but, fortunately, I am not alone. There are multiplied thousands of others who, like myself, have come to realize that before we may truly enjoy the blessings of civilized life, we must reorganize society upon a mutual and cooperative basis; and to this end we have organized a great economic and political movement that spreads over the face of all the earth.\n\nThere are today upwards of sixty millions of Socialists, loyal, devoted adherents to this cause, regardless of nationality, race, creed, color, or sex. They are all making common cause. They are spreading with tireless energy the propaganda of the new social order. They are waiting, watching, and working hopefully through all the hours of the day and the night. They are still in a minority. But they have learned how to be patient and to bide their time. The feel\u2014they know, indeed\u2014that the time is coming, in spite of all opposition, all persecution, when this emancipating gospel will spread among all the peoples, and when this minority will become the triumphant majority and, sweeping into power, inaugurate the greates social and economic change in history.\n\nIn that day we shall have the universal commonwealth\u2014the harmonious cooperation of every nation with every other nation on earth\n\nYour Honor, I ask no mercy and I plead for no immunity. I realize that finally the right must prevail. I never so clearly comprehended as now the great struggle between the powers of greed and exploitation on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of industrial freedom and social justice.\n\nI can see the dawn of the better day for humanity.

It\u2019s a neighborhood threatened by poverty, gang violence, ICE raids, and isolation\u2014in a city where income, race, and zip code can determine access to jobs, schools, healthy food, and essential services. It is against this backdrop that the Chicago teacher Xian Franzinger Barrett arrived at the neighborhood\u2019s elementary school in 2014. Recognizing the vast economic and racial inequalities his students faced, he chose what some might consider a radical approach for his writing and social-studies classes, weaving in concepts such as racism, classism, oppression, and prejudice. Barrett said it was vital to reject the oft-perpetuated narrative that society is fair and equal to address students\u2019 questions and concerns about their current conditions. And Brighton Elementary\u2019s seventh- and eighth-graders quickly put the lessons to work\u2014confronting the school board over inequitable funding, fighting to install a playground, and creating a classroom library focused on black and Latino authors. \u201cStudents who are told that things are fair implode pretty quickly in middle school as self-doubt hits them,\u201d he said, \u201cand they begin to blame themselves for problems they can\u2019t control.\u201d Barrett\u2019s personal observation is validated by a newly published study in the peer-reviewed journal Child Development that finds traditionally marginalized youth who grew up believing in the American ideal that hard work and perseverance naturally lead to success show a decline in self-esteem and an increase in risky behaviors during their middle-school years. The research is considered the first evidence linking preteens\u2019 emotional and behavioral outcomes to their belief in meritocracy, the widely held assertion that individual merit is always rewarded.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in an advantaged position in society, believing the system is fair and that everyone could just get ahead if they just tried hard enough doesn\u2019t create any conflict for you \u2026 [you] can feel good about how [you] made it,\u201d said Erin Godfrey, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor of applied psychology at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School. But for those marginalized by the system\u2014economically, racially, and ethnically\u2014believing the system is fair puts them in conflict with themselves and can have negative consequences. \u201cIf the system is fair, why am I seeing that everybody who has brown skin is in this kind of job? You\u2019re having to think about that \u2026 like you\u2019re not as good, or your social group isn\u2019t as good,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cThat\u2019s the piece \u2026 that I was trying to really get at [by studying] these kids.\u201d The findings build upon a body of literature on \u201csystem justification\u201d\u2014a social-psychology theory that believes humans tend to defend, bolster, or rationalize the status quo and see overarching social, economic, and political systems as good, fair, and legitimate. System justification is a distinctively American notion, Godfrey said, built on myths used to justify inequities, like \u201cIf you just work hard enough you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps \u2026 it\u2019s just a matter of motivation and talent and grit.\u201d Yet, as she and her colleagues discovered, these beliefs can be a liability for disadvantaged adolescents once their identity as a member of a marginalized group begins to gel\u2014and once they become keenly aware of how institutional discrimination disadvantages them and their group. \u201cIf you\u2019re [inclined] to believe that ... the system is fair, then you\u2019re maybe going to accept stereotypes about you more easily.\u201d Researchers measured system-justifying beliefs among 257 students from an urban, public middle school in Arizona. All of the students\u2019 families were identified as low-income, as defined by their eligibility for free or reduced-price lunches. The vast majority of the sample\u201491 percent\u2014were also students of color: Fifty-five percent Latino, 18 percent black, 11 percent Native American, and 7 percent other nonwhite youth. Additionally, the area, populated by many immigrant families and children, was experiencing social and political unrest due to Senate Bill 1070, a controversial Arizona law that in its original form criminalized undocumented people in the state.\n\nGodfrey asked the sixth-graders to rate their endorsement of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d and system-justifying ideas\u2014namely, that America is the land of opportunity where everyone who works hard has an equal chance to succeed. Youth were then asked to rate themselves on various qualities, including their self-esteem, risky behaviors (\u201cstayed out all night without your parent\u2019s permission,\u201d \u201ccheated on school tests,\u201d etc.), and perceived discrimination (for example: \u201cHow often have others suspected you of doing something wrong because of your ethnicity?\u201d and \u201cHow often have the police hassled you because of your ethnicity?\u201d). At three points over the course of middle school, the youth rated their self-esteem, behavior, and experience with discrimination. The results revealed an alarming trajectory. In sixth grade, among students who believed the system is fair, self-esteem was high and risky behavior was rare; by the end of seventh grade, these same students reported lower self-esteem and more risky behaviors\u2014with no significant differences based on race, ethnicity, gender, or immigration generation (youth from newly arrived immigrant families and native-born counterparts). What\u2019s more, for youth who perceived more discrimination from an early age, system-justifying beliefs were associated with less-risky behavior in sixth grade, but with a sharp rise in such behaviors by seventh grade. Godfrey attributes this spike to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d in which marginalized young people are experiencing more discrimination; beginning to understand the systemic and institutionalized nature of that discrimination; and starting to strongly identify as a member of a marginalized group, seeing that group as one that\u2019s being discriminated against. As for why this leads to more risky behavior, Godfrey points to research that suggests people who really believe the system is fair internalize stereotypes\u2014believing and acting out false and negative claims about their group\u2014more readily than those who disavow these views.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s easy to attribute the increase in risky behavior to developmental changes such as puberty, the fact that the students\u2019 outcomes started high in the sixth grade and then deteriorated suggests that psychosocial phenomena are at play. \u201cI do think that there\u2019s this element of people think of me this way anyway, so this must be who I am,\u201d Godfrey said, adding that the behaviors\u2014things like stealing and sneaking out\u2014reflect stereotypes perpetuated about youth of color. \u201cIf you\u2019re [inclined] to believe that things are the way they should be, and [that] the system is fair, then you\u2019re maybe going to accept stereotypes about you more easily.\u201d While the sample was relatively small, Godfrey said the findings are informative and mirror prior research. Indeed, previous analyses have found that system-justifying beliefs are associated with lower self-esteem in black adults and lower grade-point averages for Latino college students\u2014though the same beliefs predicted better grades and less distress for \u201chigh status\u201d youth. \u201cI was really interested in trying to think of [early adolescents] as active agents in their world,\u201d Godfrey said, \u201cand as people who can understand and interpret their social world in a way that a lot of research doesn\u2019t recognize.\u201d \u201cWe cannot equivocate when it comes to preparing our children to face injustices.\u201d David Stovall, professor of educational-policy studies and African American studies at University of Illinois at Chicago, said the paper is a confirmation of decades of analysis on the education of marginalized and isolated youth. It\u2019s a \u201cgood preliminary piece\u201d that lays the foundation for more academic study of historically disenfranchised adolescents and their motivations, he said.\n\n\u201cIf young folks see themselves being discriminated against, they\u2019ve been told that a system is fair, and they experience things that are unfair, they will begin to reject this particular system and engage in behaviors that will not be to their betterment,\u201d he explained. Stovall said it\u2019s critical to guide young people from \u201cdefiant resistance\u201d\u2014defying what they\u2019ve learned to be untrue regarding a just and fair system for all\u2014to \u201ctransformative resistance\u201d\u2014developing a critical understanding of the historical context of U.S. society. Educators, he said, play a crucial role in this work. \u201cWe have to ask different questions around school,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes [school] contribute further to our [students\u2019] marginalization and oppression? Is it just about order, compliance, and white normative standards that marginalized young folks of color don\u2019t measure up to because the structure never intended for them to measure up?\u201d He also warned educators and youth of color to be prepared for pushback, highlighting the current legal battle over the ethnic-studies ban in Tucson public schools despite its proven academic benefits. Mildred Boveda, an assistant education professor at Arizona State University, likewise said the findings hold important implications for both teachers and teacher education. \u201cThis is of great consequence to \u2026 teachers who may think they are protecting children by avoiding conversations about systems of oppressions,\u201d she said, emphasizing that the onus is also on teacher-prep programs to ensure aspiring educators know how to address these controversial topics. Given her recent experience teaching fifth-graders in Miami-Dade, Florida, Boveda disagrees with the researchers\u2019 notion that sixth-graders lack a full understanding of social hierarchies. Her students on the brink of middle school, she noted, were hyper-aware of social inequalities. Still, she sees valuable insights in the data. \u201cUnlike the majority of the teaching workforce, I once fit the demographics of the students in this study,\u201d she said, alluding to the fact that more than 80 percent of public-school teachers are white. \u201cI will admit that it sometimes felt risky to tackle these difficult conversations, but this [research] underscores why we cannot equivocate when it comes to preparing our children to face injustices.\u201d"}, "http://billmoyers.com/story/need-confront-billionaires-paradise/": {"title": "Why We Need to Confront the Billionaires\u2019 Paradise", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://billmoyers.com/story/need-confront-billionaires-paradise/", "text": "It\u2019s time to \u201cstrike back\u201d against the undemocratic and unequal state of our own country and the Western world.\n\nThis post originally appeared at Our Future.\n\nThe concentrated wealth of the global plutocracy is the dark matter of the world economy: It is rarely glimpsed and difficult to measure, yet it reshapes everything around it.\n\nTwo recent reports \u2014 the UBS/PwC report on the \u201cnew Gilded Age\u201d of the international billionaire class, and the \u201cParadise Papers\u201d released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) reveal ways corporations and the ultrawealthy avoid taxes. In doing so, they offer a glimpse into this darkness.\n\nTogether, these releases tell us a lot about the wealthy few who run the world.\n\nWe now know that the British royal family has been less than open with the people they rule, who preserve their dubious privilege to monarchy. And we have learned that, by investing in a Lithuanian shopping center as an end run around taxes, U2\u2019s Bono may have finally found what he\u2019s looking for.\n\nBut these reports also help us see how much we still don\u2019t know about the powerful few. In an era when, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, only three Americans \u2014 Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett \u2014 own more wealth than half of our entire population, we need to do more to understand \u2014 and confront \u2014 the super-concentration of resources.\n\nThe Swiss bank UBS and the American accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers weren\u2019t looking to write an expos\u00e9 when they prepared their annual \u201cBillionaires Insights\u201d report for 2017. On the contrary. So-called \u201cvery high net worth individuals\u201d are the financial industry\u2019s most sought-after clients. The report is entitled, without any apparent irony, \u201cNew value creators gain momentum.\u201d\n\nAnd gain momentum these billionaires did. As the report notes, \u201cGlobally, the total wealth of billionaires rose by +17 percent in 2016, up from USD $5.1 trillion to USD6.0 trillion.\u201d\n\nDid your net worth grow by 17 percent last year? Unless you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s 1,542 billionaires, chances are it didn\u2019t.\n\nIn the United States, wealth for most households grew at a much slower rate, while racial disparities in wealth persist in middle-class households.\n\nAnalyses from economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman show a dramatic gain in income for the very wealthy \u2014 and no one else \u2014 in recent decades. In a useful explainer, David Leonhardt of The New York Times concluded:\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve reports that millions of Americans continue to struggle. Thirty percent of adults, roughly 73 million people, are finding it difficult to make ends meet or are barely getting by. Just under one-fourth of all adults said they could not pay all their bills for the current month. Forty-four percent said they could not cover an emergency expense of $400, and one-fourth of all adults reported that they had to forgo medical treatment during the past year because of the cost.\n\nAs of last report, America\u2019s 10 wealthiest men \u2014 they are all men \u2014 are collectively worth more than $633 billion. The combined wealth of these 10 men has risen by nearly $116 billion since the start of this year alone.\n\nThe explosive growth of billionaire wealth, at a time when the middle class is dying and millions of Americans are struggling, has implications for democracy as well as the economy.\n\nThe work of political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page has shown that the preferences of the majority have very little effect on government policy, while the political wishes of the wealthy few are far more likely to become reality.\n\nAs history teaches us, centralized wealth often leads to political oligarchy. Our country is no exception. Expand this oligarchical effect across the globe, and you get a sense of the global reach of the billionaire class. As Oxfam international reported earlier this year, just eight men possesses as much of the world\u2019s wealth as half the global population.\n\nThe author of the UBS/PwC report commented that \u201cWe are now two years into the peak of the second Gilded Age,\u201d with levels of inequality not seen since 1905. He also says that \u201cthis is something billionaires are concerned about,\u201d leading to fears that the world\u2019s population could \u201cstrike back.\u201d\n\nThe report lists some of the ways the billionaire class spends its money. Art collections, sports clubs and philanthropy all rate a mention. Recent political events in the US demonstrate that they\u2019re also using their power to further enrich themselves and keep the majority from \u201cstriking back.\u201d\n\nOne thing the wealthy are apparently not doing with their money is paying much in taxes. The ICIJ\u2019s Panama Papers revealed that many people are using illegal means to avoiding taxation.\n\nThe Paradise Papers reveal something equally important: how billionaires and corporations can evade taxation \u2014 and public scrutiny of their wealth \u2014 through legal means. These documents were obtained from Appleby, one of the world\u2019s leading law firms specializing in offshore accounts.\n\nThe New York Times recently profiled two billionaire political donors, one Democratic and one Republican, in an article about the papers that also cited an Appleby publication on the ultrawealthy\u2019s problem of \u201cmotivating children with means.\u201d\n\nThe Appleby brochure includes the picture of a small boy in a three-piece suit; apparently that counts as cute to the super-rich. Another handout shows \u201ca handsome couple\u201d rushing to board a private jet, while another is captioned \u201cwealth seeks out safe harbours.\u201d\n\nAppleby clients include prominent Democrats like Penny Pritzker, commerce secretary under President Obama, George Soros and the aforementioned donor, James Simons. They also include prominent Republicans like Sheldon Adelson, Carl Icahn and billionaire Robert Mercer, who used some of the money he saved avoiding taxes to set Steve Bannon up with a media empire.\n\nWhen it comes to disseminating their ideas, it\u2019s striking how many hard-core conservatives don\u2019t trust the \u201cfree market\u201d to get the job done.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders has called for an investigation into the papers, noting that corporations such as Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Apple and Nike are implicated in the documents.\n\nOffshore havens do more than just help clients evade taxes. They also help them avoid responsibility. As The Times reports, \u201canother offshore firm\u2026 advertises that it helps clients \u2018preserve wealth from the ravages of litigation, political tumult and divorce.\u2019\u201d\n\nPop stars also availed themselves of Appleby\u2019s services, including the aforementioned Bono, who took advantage of Malta\u2019s generous tax rates for foreign investors when he funneled money into that Lithuanian shopping center.\n\nBut then, the self-satisfied singer has a long history of giving high-minded speeches while failing to deliver for the poor, either personally or politically.\n\nIn his book The Frontman, author Harry Browne writes that Bono\u2019s politics are \u201cbroadly \u2026 conservative\u201d and can be seen as \u201cfundamentally nonthreatening to the elites that have wreaked havoc on the world.\u201d To Browne, Bono is \u201ca slick mix of traditional missionary and commercial colonialism, in which the poor world exists as a task for the rich world to complete.\u201d\n\nIn an oligarchical world, figures like Bono matter. They provide the singer\u2019s \u201cfriends,\u201d who range from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Jesse Helms, with a veneer of conscience. They inoculate members of the global elite from the guilt that is rightfully theirs.\n\nSpeaking of \u201cfrontmen\u201d: the papers also show that Britain\u2019s Prince Charles invested millions of pounds offshore. His estate insisted that the investment, which may have indirectly benefited from the prince\u2019s environmental campaigns, be kept secret. The Queen also invested heavily in offshore companies, including one that has been criticized for exploiting poor families.\n\nThe Royals insisted that they obtain no tax advantage from these investments, which suggests that the public face of Britain\u2019s government may well have been trying to hide its wealth from Britain\u2019s people.\n\nThe authors of the UBS report probably didn\u2019t intend these words to sound as ominous as they do:\n\nThey are undoubtedly correct. Americans need look no further then Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet and circle of advisers, where billionaires gather to plot everyone else\u2019s future while the rest of the Republican Party dutifully falls in line. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn were among those implicated by the Paradise Papers.\n\nThe effect of billionaire \u201cnetworks\u201d may also be found in the Democratic Party\u2019s struggle to develop a platform that reflects the needs of working Americans without alienating very many high-net-worth donors. Hint: It can\u2019t be done.\n\nConcentrated wealth tends to be amoral, and the ultrawealthy are growing more powerful all the time. And since small businesses usually can\u2019t afford the services of firms like Appleby, legalized tax evasion increases inequality among both individuals and businesses.\n\nHow can the United States and the world respond before it\u2019s too late? Economists like Piketty and Zucman have called for a global wealth tax, although that would be difficult to enforce.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) argued that taxes on the Western world\u2019s 1 percent should be \u201csignificantly higher.\u201d The Paradise Papers illustrate the importance of ending legalized tax evasion, and Zucman wrote an op-ed on the topic for The New York Times.\n\nBut it is hard to pass such measures in today\u2019s political world. Here in the United States, there\u2019s a strong chance Trump and Congress will cut taxes on billionaires and corporations instead. That\u2019s what that happens when wealth becomes too concentrated and political power follows suit.\n\n\n\n What We\u2019re Looking For\n\nThe undemocratic and unequal state of our own country can no longer be hidden. These reports are informative, but so far we\u2019ve only glimpsed the oligarchy\u2019s reach and power.\n\nThis concentration of power must be investigated, and then it must be confronted \u2013 by a majority determined to take back the economy and democracy from the powerful few who have made it their plaything, before it\u2019s too late.\n\nIt\u2019s time to \u201cstrike back\u201d \u2014 not against wealthy individuals, but against oligarchy itself."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/16/one-in-10-senior-politicians-in-brazil-funded-by-companies-linked-to-slavery": {"title": "One in 10 senior politicians in Brazil funded by companies 'linked to slavery'", "keywords": ["Global development", "Brazil", "Americas", "World news", "Slavery"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/16/one-in-10-senior-politicians-in-brazil-funded-by-companies-linked-to-slavery", "text": "More than one in 10 of Brazil\u2019s high-ranking politicians, among them President Michel Temer, received campaign donations from companies linked to modern-day slavery, an investigation has found.\n\nParty leaders, state secretaries and five of ex-president Dilma Rousseff\u2019s governors are among the elected parliamentarians who received R$3.5m (\u00a3760,000) during the last general election, according to the NGO Rep\u00f3rter Brasil.\n\nTemer\u2019s election committee was found to have received R$700,000 (\u00a3150,000) from OAS, a Brazilian construction company found guilty of keeping 111 workers in slave-like conditions during the expansion of S\u00e3o Paulo airport, in 2013.\n\n\u201cThis is just one of an ocean of shocking practices that Temer\u2019s administration has exposed,\u201d said Xavier Plassat, head of the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT).\n\n\n\nPresident Temer is being investigated for corruption as part of the nationwide Lava Jato (\u201cCar Wash\u201d) enquiry following accusations that he received bribes from JBS, the meat-packing company. JBS was at the heart of a series of Brazilian corruption and meat-industry scandals last year, including investigations of reported slavery in its supply chain.\n\nThough receiving donations is neither a crime nor forbidden by Brazil\u2019s electoral commission, the report provides an insight into how closely connected lawmakers can be with companies and individuals linked to illegal practices.\n\nTwenty-one of the 51 MPs who received donations from companies identified by the authorities as using slave labour are part of the extremely influential rural caucus in congress. This lobby has continually attempted to limit efforts to combat slavery in Brazil and, late last year, supported Temer\u2019s attempt to restrict the legal definition of modern-day slavery.\n\nAccording to Brazilian law, four conditions are used to categorise \u201cslave-like labour\u201d: being forced to work; being obliged to work to pay off debts; degrading conditions that put workers\u2019 health or dignity at risk; and an excessive workload that threatens workers\u2019 health.\n\nIn a statement sent to Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, the president\u2019s office said Temer was not aware of the company\u2019s slave labour case, and that \u201c[the] money was passed on to other candidates\u201d. The office also denied that the donation had had any influence over Temer\u2019s political decisions.\n\nOAS did not respond to requests for comment from Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which is based in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nMarcos Montes \u2013 a federal deputy for the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, who has repeatedly voted to decrease workers\u2019 rights and limit the definition of slavery in Brazil \u2013 received donations from two entities on the register of companies caught using slave labour: \u00a333,000 from Cutrale, one of the biggest orange juice suppliers in the world, and \u00a31,000 from Marco Barbosa, a farmer found to be keeping eight workers in slave-like conditions in 2007.\n\nCutrale, which was caught keeping workers in slave-like conditions in 2017, said in a statement: \u201cAll donations made by Cutrale in election periods have always been made in a legal and transparent manner.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeither Marcos nor Barbosa responded to Rep\u00f3rter Brasil\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAnother deputy from Minas Gerais, Domingos S\u00e1vio, who authored a bill to reduce rest periods for those who work outdoors in often blistering heat, received a direct donation of \u00a34,000 from a construction company, which was on the register after it was found to be keeping 40 workers in conditions of modern-day slavery in 2014.\n\nS\u00e1vio also made an amendment to labour laws, halving fines for those who illegally employ workers without signing their employment documents. S\u00e1vio did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cThese findings are very useful for demystifying what is fuelling current attempts to backpedal on workers\u2019 rights and anti-slavery legislation,\u201d said Plassat. \u201cThe rural and construction lobbies are presenting a very strong offensive.\n\n\u201cIt is not a surprise that those MPs who are supporting Temer\u2019s administration in these huge regressions might be funded by those employers and corporations whose interests they are advocating for on a daily basis in congress.\u201d\n\nRep\u00f3rter Brasil cross-checked campaign donations from the electoral court against companies that have been included on a centralised register of employers caught using slave labour between 2003 and 2017. The data includes cases of slave labour identified before and after the 2014 election.\n\nThese findings are part of the \u201cRuralometer\u201d, a tool developed by Rep\u00f3rter Brasil to monitor the impact of actions by federal deputies on the environment, indigenous people and rural workers.\n\n\u201cConsidering that most of the politicians we evaluated are expected to run in this year\u2019s elections, the Ruralometer aims to bring public interest into the debate, as well as monitor agendas behind campaign finance,\u201d said Ana Aranha, from Rep\u00f3rter Brasil."}, "https://theestablishment.co/everyone-who-enabled-milo-yiannopoulos-shouldve-seen-this-coming-e6778af8f0a1#.s0v63hahv": {"title": "Everyone Who Enabled Milo Yiannopoulos Should\u2019ve Seen This Coming", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://theestablishment.co/everyone-who-enabled-milo-yiannopoulos-shouldve-seen-this-coming-e6778af8f0a1#.s0v63hahv", "text": "I t appears there is a point where a white man can be denied a major platform on moral grounds.\n\nThis weekend, Breitbart tech editor, crypto-Nazi, and serial online abuser Milo Yiannopoulos discovered, the hard way, that there are still some taboos you can\u2019t ironize your way out of. After he was confirmed as a keynote speaker for CPAC, the annual gathering of conservative movement leaders, video resurfaced of him explicitly defending pedophilia. In the wake of the controversy, Simon & Schuster canceled his book deal, his CPAC invitation was revoked, and he resigned from Breitbart.\n\nHowever, I say resurfaced for a reason \u2014 and that\u2019s what this brief reflection on Yiannopoulos\u2019 downfall is about.\n\nWhile his legion of conservative and liberal defenders are now suddenly having heart palpitations and saying \u201cI didn\u2019t know!\u201d the truth is that Yiannopoulos was always a known quantity, and his defence of pedophilia \u2014 deploying arguments common to MRAs in general \u2014 was already out there. This blog post, laying out some of what resurfaced this weekend, is from April of last year, long before Yiannopoulos\u2019 destructive appearances on college campuses, his Simon & Schuster contract, or his appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nNo one listened, in part because at the time he was still best known as a GamerGate ringleader who was marshaling attacks against women, cis and trans, who, while not public figures, had the temerity to publicly oppose the long-running harassment campaign. Yiannopoulos used GamerGate as a personal army to give his Breitbart column some bite, ruining or attempting to ruin the lives of women who annoyed him. His past flirtations with neo-Nazism were known, as was his attempt \u2014 with co-author Allum Bokhari \u2014 to lend respectability to Nazis like Richard Spencer and helping to popularize the euphemism \u201calt-right.\u201d His gutter-level racism against Leslie Jones, calling her a man, an ape, and barely literate, earned him the boot from Twitter, but quite arguably raised his stock among conservatives and free-speech-obsessed liberals who enjoyed how he infuriated the left.\n\nOf note is that all the concerned liberals who, armed with apocryphal Voltaire quotes, vowed to defend Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 free speech to the death, are conspicuously absent now that the people doing the \u201cno-platforming\u201d are white conservatives upset about pedophilia. Free speech absolutism turns out not to be so absolute after all when those with power can imagine their white children being harmed by the man they lend a platform to.\n\nYet, for those of us who dealt with Yiannopoulos and the reactionary troll movement he\u2019s co-opted since 2014, none of this was especially shocking. Indeed, for those of us familiar with his depredations, the fact that pedophilia advocacy caused his downfall is a kind of poetic justice.\n\n\u201cMirroring\u201d is the name I gave to a troll tactic that draws on rather old agitprop techniques: Accuse your opponent of that which you are guilty. GamerGaters became quite adept at it, turning all the adjectives used to describe them back on both their critics and their victims. In their first month, they had not a care in the world for the issue of online harassment. But once the media widely reported that they were a harassment campaign, GamerGaters suddenly began posing as victims of online abuse and accusing their very victims of perpetrating it against them. To an outside observer, it looked like two equally squalid factions going \u201cno you!\u201d at each other, and the smokescreen had its intended effect: making powerful people throw up their hands and dismiss the campaign being directed at women, people of color, and queer folks in game journalism and development as \u201cjust another flame war on the internet.\u201d\n\nThe other major coup for the mirroring strategy came when Canadian media critic Dan Olson exposed one of GamerGate\u2019s main staging sites, a 4chan clone called 8chan, as a hub for the spread of child pornography. He presented incontrovertible evidence of the site\u2019s depravity \u2014 and notably how it was defended by both 8chan\u2019s owner and many GamerGaters as a bastion of free speech (apocryphal Voltaire quotes abounded, naturally). The photos on the site included photos of actual children forced into sexualized positions; there could be no question about the harm being materially perpetrated.\n\nThis is not to say that all GamerGaters were pedophiles, but the movement was so fixated on their hatred of feminists in videogames that this was something they were willing to tolerate.\n\nIndeed, instead of retreating from or disowning 8chan, GamerGaters viciously attacked Olson, accusing him of pedophilia and trying to play up the fact that he had to view the porn on 8chan in order to write about it.\n\nAt around the same time, Sarah Nyberg, another inveterate critic of the movement on Twitter, found herself similarly attacked. She had initially been an anonymous critic before GamerGate doxed her and exposed her legal name. From there she found herself the repeated victim of hacking and other efforts to dig up dirt on her. Nevertheless, she persisted in a campaign to deprive 8chan of its funding from Patreon and PayPal, arguing that the site\u2019s willingness to host child pornography made them ineligible for the services. Both websites eventually agreed, and GamerGate wanted revenge.\n\nUnlike Olson, however, Nyberg was a transgender woman who made a tantalizing target for a movement that always sought to attack those with the fewest resources to defend themselves \u2014 thus she was hit forcefully with the same false accusations he was.\n\nBigotry infused this act of vengeance: The idea that trans people are sexual predators is one Yiannopoulos himself spread on Real Time and elsewhere, after all. It was all made worse by the fact that GamerGate exploited hacked and leaked private chatroom logs from Nyberg\u2019s teen years that they decontextualized and spun as support for pedophilia.\n\nThis was when Yiannopoulos got involved. He published a sexualized photograph of Nyberg from when she was an underage teenager, one she\u2019d sent to her then-girlfriend, on the front page of Breitbart. This headlined an article libeling her as a paedophile, which sired not only a wave of harassment against her but a strangling of her economic resources. Yiannopoulos knew full well that the accusations against Nyberg were poorly sourced and flimsy, that she had even gone so far as to voluntarily go to the police to have the \u201cevidence\u201d assessed and summarily dismissed as trivial. Yet he did to her what he tried to do to Shanley Kane, Brianna Wu, Randi Lee Harper, and others: libel her with salacious accusations. Yiannopoulos gave a media platform to the GamerGate tactic of piling into the life of a critic and attempting to undermine or destroy them with false \u2014 sometimes mirrored \u2014 accusations. I myself was accused of any number of fake scandals, and I\u2019ve been in my share of red-line conspiracy flowcharts. I even have my very own Zapruder-style blown-up photograph.\n\nBut it was the false accusations of pedophilia that represented GamerGate\u2019s most desperate strategy to discredit their critics. Trolls harassed those of us who defended Olson and Nyberg, asking in our places of work, \u201cDid you know so and so is friends with a pedophile?\u201d Some GamerGaters even convinced themselves that the hated \u201cSocial Justice Warriors\u201d they opposed were actually a secret ring of pedophiles in videogame journalism.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. GamerGate represented a new form of reactionary and neo-fascistic organization, deploying troll tactics and the echo chamber of social media to their advantage. Pizzagate had all of GamerGate\u2019s hallmarks: weaponized pedophilia accusations, a conspiracy theory about media collusion, misinterpreted and decontextualized hacked emails being spun as a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d on and on. As if that weren\u2019t enough, Yiannopoulos wanted to talk about Pizzagate on his \u201cDangerous Faggot Tour\u201d of college campuses; it appeared to be quietly cancelled after the shooting at Comet Ping Pong pizza.\n\nThus, yes, there\u2019s poetic justice in Yiannopoulos\u2019 precipitous fall from grace being caused by his own sincere advocacy of pedophilia and mocking the plight of the Catholic Church\u2019s many sexual abuse victims.\n\nBut will there be actual justice? An attempt to make his victims whole again? What will be done to prevent the mainstream from feting the next Yiannopoulos?\n\nBoth liberals and conservatives let themselves get seduced by his shtick, after all. Given that the media\u2019s favorite description for the man is the debonair-sounding \u201cprovacateur,\u201d even in reports on his demise, I\u2019m not optimistic about the right lessons being learned. To look at the responses of Yiannopoulos\u2019 most ardent right-wing fans is to see a crowd chanting the usual lines about \u201cfake news.\u201d For instance, this contrite (if doubtlessly opportunistic) tweet from Yiannopoulos\u2019 former manager is being slammed with angry and disappointed responses from his fans.\n\nThere will be another Yiannopoulos; someone who minds his words just a little more carefully, someone who will become the new troll messiah to those disaffected hashtag spewers in their fallen hero\u2019s Facebook comments. That was always the saddest thing about Yiannopoulos: his interchangeability. He was a mass-produced YouTube-comment-made-flesh who had no original thoughts and whose public persona was simply a copy of the depersonalized, collective nihilism found on 4chan. If he doesn\u2019t succeed in a Hail Mary pass to save his career, he\u2019ll simply be replaced.\n\nAs to the fact that Simon & Schuster cancelled his lucrative book contract, Roxane Gay, who pulled her own book with S&S in protest, put it best when she called it a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d that exposed their willingness to accept Yiannopoulos\u2019 manifold bigotries and abuses. Indeed, S&S likely dropped the man because they realized that they might lose the only audience they could bank on for his book: conservatives who got off on offending liberal/left sensibilities.\n\nFor Yiannopoulos\u2019 most ardent fans, they\u2019ll continue to hold a candle for him; but in time, it\u2019ll sink in that \u2014 to use their phrase \u2014 he cucked himself. His apology on Facebook committed three sins: It was cloying, it was PR-friendly, and it existed. As I pointed out when I wrote about Richard Spencer, you defeat trolls by exposing the fact that their invulnerable, \u201cI have no feelings\u201d tough guy act is simply that. Milo was forced to publicly appear to care about something, to appear to demonstrate sensitivity. In the world of trolling, where you\u2019re never supposed to say sorry, that\u2019s not easy to live down.\n\nWe can only speculate about what will come of his scheduled press conference this afternoon.\n\nIn the meantime, the media\u2019s doyens would do well to listen to women of color and other routine victims of this abuse-as-discourse shtick. It\u2019s so common as to be the background radiation of our daily lives. We know it\u2019s nothing new, nothing truly edgy \u2014 just garden-variety prejudices with a spray tan and a dressing of naughty words. It may be a delectable scandal for the chattering classes, but it\u2019s nothing if not a hack clown act that\u2019s both destructive and oh-so-replaceable.\n\nWhen that new Milo comes along, those in power should be ready to show them the door instead of the stage."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/22/donald-trump-administration-punishing-dissent-protesters": {"title": "Anti-Trump protesters risk 60 years in jail. Is dissent a crime? | Yael Bromberg and Eirik Cheverud", "keywords": ["Trump administration", "Protest", "Law", "US news"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/22/donald-trump-administration-punishing-dissent-protesters", "text": "On the morning of President Trump\u2019s inauguration, police trapped and arrested more than 230 people. Some were anti-Trump demonstrators; some were not. The next day, federal prosecutors charged them all with \u201cfelony rioting\u201d, a nonexistent crime in Washington DC. The prosecution then launched a sweeping investigation into the defendants\u2019 lives, demanding vast amounts of online information through secret warrants.\n\nProsecutors eventually dropped a few defendants, like journalists and legal observers, but simultaneously increased the charges against everyone else. The most recent indictment collectively charged more than 200 people with felony rioting, felony incitement to riot, conspiracy to riot, and five property-damage crimes \u2013 all from broken windows. \n\n\n\nEach defendant is facing over 60 years in prison.\n\nThe prosecution next obtained warrants focused on anti-Trump organizers. One sought a list of all visitors to a website that organizers used to promote Inauguration Day protests. A second sought information on all Facebook friends and related communications of two organizers, the host of a coalition Facebook page, and those who simply \u201cliked\u201d that page. \n\n\n\nDespite legal challenges, a court recently decided to enforce the warrants, requiring only that personally identifiable information be redacted for \u201cirrelevant\u201d material. This unprecedented prosecution follows a drastic change in local law enforcement\u2019s response to protest. \n\n\n\nThe DC Office of Police Complaints issued a report critical of the mass arrest, noting the departure from standard operating procedure and the likelihood that police lacked individualized probable cause to arrest everyone. This is exactly the type of action new policies and statutes enacted in DC were meant to avoid, following a 2002 mass arrest that caused the District to pay over $10m in settlements.\n\nCompare this crackdown with the government\u2019s response to the pre-planned, armed violence and rioting by white supremacists and private militia groups in Charlottesville, Virginia. \n\n\n\nThere was no sweeping online dragnet to identify organizers who conspired to plan, promote, and carry out violence in Charlottesville \u2013 violence against people, not property. \n\n\n\nNor were all the participants in Charlottesville rounded up and charged with felony conspiracy to commit rioting \u2013 or charged as accessories to Heather Heyer\u2019s murder. Instead, federal prosecutors have done little to nothing. \n\n\n\nOnline activists exposed the identities of a few white supremacists, leading to charges from local law enforcement due to public pressure. But there have been no felony rioting charges, no charges of guilt-by-association, no police raids, no sweeping investigation.\n\nOther riots have gone unchallenged by law enforcement. In 2006, Steelers fans rioted after their team won the Super Bowl, causing over $150,000 in damage (by comparison, prosecutors allege the inauguration defendants caused an estimated $100,000 of damage on 20 January \u2013 most of which was attributable to a limousine fire that occurred after the mass arrest.)\n\n\n\nPolice charged some Steelers fans with individualized offenses, but no riot charges. In 2015, University of Kentucky basketball fans rioted after their team lost to Wisconsin; once again, some arrests, but no riot charges.\n\nHow do prosecutors decide when to dust off the rioting statutes and whom to charge? Apparently, the reasons for the alleged rioting are important. \n\n\n\nSports riots are \u201cpeople letting off steam\u201d. Riots by white supremacists evidently occur with no criminal consequences. And why should law enforcement behave differently? Neither scenario threatens the state itself. \n\n\n\nWhen people stand in opposition to the government, like the demonstrators did on 20 January, the analysis changes; suddenly conduct becomes \u201crioting\u201d, deserving of a lifetime in prison.\n\nThis is classic content-based discrimination of freedom of speech and assembly, and selective prosecution. The state cracks down when it disapproves of the reasons why a riot occurs, but holds back when rioters are not responding to state violence and oppression. Notably, the first time prosecutors used the riot statutes in DC was to punish protesters following Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination.\n\nAll this raises the questions \u2013 who gets to define \u201cviolence\u201d, and what of the permissibility of state-sanctioned violence? Does the state not commit violence when it brutally attacks anti-Trump protesters and arrests them without probable cause? Does the state not commit violence by trying to put hundreds of people behind bars for decades? Does the state not commit violence by failing to intervene against armed force exacted by white supremacists? Does the state not commit violence when it protects hate speech and punishes government critics?\n\nTrials for the inauguration protesters begin mid-November and will continue for a year. As media ramps up coverage, do not forget what these trials are about \u2013 not rioting, not broken windows, but punishing dissent."}, "http://nypost.com/2017/02/12/neo-nazis-beat-up-brothers-over-anti-fascist-sticker-cops/": {"title": "\u2018Neo-Nazis\u2019 beat up brothers over \u2018anti-fascist\u2019 sticker: cops", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/12/neo-nazis-beat-up-brothers-over-anti-fascist-sticker-cops/", "text": "A group of \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d beat up two twin brothers and menaced them with a knife in front of a Lower East Side bar Saturday morning when they took offense to an \u201canti-fascist\u201d sticker on one of the men\u2019s cellphone cases, police said.\n\nThe beatdown happened when the brothers, both 27-year-old Columbia graduate students, noticed the large group of \u201cskinheads\u201d hanging inside one of their usual haunts called Clockwork on Essex Street and decided to head for the exits around 12:30 a.m.\n\nOn the way out the door, they ran into a group of smokers outside who noticed the sticker on one of their phones reading \u201cNew York City Anti-Fascists.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the guys \u2026 sees [my brother\u2019s] phone, grabs it and starts screaming, \u2018I know what the f\u2014 that means, I know what the f\u2014 that sticker is, you need to get the f\u2014 out of here,\u2019\u201d said one of the victims, who asked to remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cHe throws the phone on the ground and they just start jumping us right in front of the bar.\u201d\n\nThe brothers were pummeled by about six or seven men \u2014 some who were using brass knuckles \u2014 and dressed in matching vests with \u201c211 Crew\u201d patches, a white supremacy gang, police said.

That\u2019s how I feel. I feel like I haven\u2019t left, we\u2019ve just exchanged prisons.\u201d\n\nThat grim assessment, that even in freedom she was trapped within a prison, dawned on her as she walking one day through the streets of Brooklyn. The New York borough has a reputation for hipster cool, but she was shocked to see so many heavily armed police.\n\n\u201cThere was this immense police presence and they were militarized. I\u2019ve been part of an occupying force in a foreign country, and I know what that looks like. That\u2019s what I saw in Brooklyn \u2013 an occupying force.\u201d\n\nHer powerful fear about what America has become in the seven years of her incarceration, combined with an equally powerful determination to do something about it lies behind Chelsea Manning\u2019s announcement this week that she is running for a US Senate seat.\n\nFear and determination \u2013 you could say that has been her dual hallmark since she made the fateful decision in 2010 to leak a vast trove of 700,000 secret documents when she was working as an intelligence analyst at a US military base in Iraq.\n\nIn the first interview Manning, 30, has given since she posted details of her Senate bid on Twitter, the Guardian asked her whether she drew a straight line between becoming one of the most famous \u2013 and most severely punished \u2013 official leakers in US history and her political ambitions today. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a direct line,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s windy, a lot has happened. I\u2019m a very different person than I was 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nBut there are certainly parallels between the two events. It was an act of extreme courage \u2013 some would, and did, say folly \u2013 to download and transmit war logs, embassy cables, videos and Guant\u00e1namo files to WikiLeaks. It is an act of extreme courage \u2013 some might, and are, saying folly \u2013 to run for the US Senate.\n\nThere\u2019s also a profound dichotomy to be found somewhere along that winding road between her May 2010 arrest and her new campaign: she wouldn\u2019t have the global platform she enjoys today were it not for the at times brutal treatment she received at the hands of the US military. How does she make sense of such opposites?\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t made sense of it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think there has to be an explanation. I learned very quickly that my experience in prison has shaped my understanding of the world.\u201d\n\nWe meet, appropriately on the first anniversary of President Obama\u2019s commutation of Manning\u2019s sentence, in her apartment outside Washington DC. It has a large living room that is full of light, but strangely empty and devoid of human touch, as though she had replicated, albeit more comfortably, the spartan aesthetic of a prison cell. The walls are almost bare besides prints of Oscar Wilde and anarchist Emma Goldman above the fireplace, and a copy of Manning\u2019s commutation letter.\n\nShe is dressed in black, as she was in the video launching the Senate campaign in which she carried a red rose as symbol of political resistance. In the bright light of the room, her eyes are piercingly blue-grey, topped by a slash of pink eye shadow. She wears a silver necklace with a hashtag pendant; asked why, she replies without hesitation: \u201cTwitter \u2026 got me out of prison.\u201d\n\nTo say that Manning has taken on a tough job running for office in her home state of Maryland is an understatement. The incumbent in the 26 June Democratic primary, Ben Cardin, is a seasoned veteran going for a third term, the leading Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, with a large and loyal following of centrist voters.\n\nCardin is reported to have at least $2m in his war chest, and the last time he faced a primary challenge in 2012 he beat his opponent by 74% to 16%. Manning has raised a little under $50,000 so far, drawn from small online donations, with a staff currently of two that she wants to keep lean throughout the campaign at under 10.\n\nHow can she possibly compete?\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s a real fight ahead of us,\u201d she said, insisting that she is in the race to win. Whatever happens, though, she will not compromise her convictions to garner votes. \u201cWe do want to win, but if we lose our principles then winning wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nManning says she is putting her faith in victory in the local activist and student groups with whom she has been building connections since her release. \u201cWe are not doing a centralized ground game, we are waiting for local communities to come to us. I will come, and I will listen.\u201d\n\nDoes she fear that she could crash and burn, as the Black Lives Matter celebrity DeRay Mckesson did when he contested the Democratic primary for Baltimore mayor in 2016, coming in sixth with just 2% of the vote?\n\n\u201cBaltimore is a deep-rooted city with a very active activist community, and I don\u2019t think DeRay utilized that,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m not going to criticize a friend of mine, but at the same time we are talking to local people in Maryland, and we are taking the time.\u201d\n\nManning\u2019s political style is already fully on view through her Twitter feed. It is vibrant and provocative, fusing upbeat jingles like \u201c#WeGotThis\u201d \u2013 a mantra that she developed in prison to buoy up her spirits at times of despair \u2013 with blunt language that compares the federal immigration agency Ice to the Gestapo and says \u201cfuck the police\u201d without elucidation.\n\nThat approach clearly works for her 323,000 Twitter followers. But how it will play on the doorsteps of Maryland, a state with a large federal employee contingent (the NSA spy center is based here), remains to be seen.\n\nManning calls her politics \u201cradical anti-authoritarianism\u201d. Asked to explain, she grew animated, her voice crescendoing: \u201cThe United States has the largest and most expensive military in the world, but we always want more. We have the largest prison system in the world, yet we want more. We have the largest and most sophisticated intelligence apparatus in the world by far, and still we want more. How much is enough? That is my moment \u2013 we need this to stop.\u201d\n\nThough she says she has no animus towards Cardin \u2013 \u201cI voted for him twice\u201d \u2013 she sees him as part of the problem. She points to the Israeli Anti-Boycott Act that he championed that has been widely criticized for attempting to stifle protests against Israeli settlements.\n\nIn her first campaign statement, Manning mentions three core policy areas: criminal justice, healthcare and immigration. In each, she pitches herself strikingly to the left of Bernie Sanders. Prisons should be closed and inmates released; all hospitals should be free at the point of use, no questions asked; US borders should be open.\n\nAnd she really means open. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be denying the absolute right to come into the United States. You have a right, everybody does.\u201d\n\nWhat would she say to a Maryland voter worried about terrorists entering the country? \u201cWe have domestic terrorists and they can travel wherever they want. Closing off the borders doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d\n\nThat initial position statement is as interesting for what it omits as for what it addresses. Manning is silent on transgender politics, despite being at the forefront herself of the trans movement. And she does not mention Donald Trump.\n\nWhy no reference to the man who for many progressives has become the embodiment of evil?\n\n\u201cAll our problems are personalized into one individual, but it\u2019s a systemic problem. Our broken immigration system didn\u2019t pop up overnight, it was a machine built over decades by centrists from both sides.\u201d\n\nManning said that she will soon begin appearing in public meetings at the invitation of local groups. Given that her Twitter feed regularly attracts vile hate-filled comments and threats of violence towards her from transphobic and rightwing detractors, is she not anxious about her safety?\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me. These people want to shut dissent down, and we have to push back. I\u2019m not going to be deterred by somebody saying horrible things to me.\u201d\n\nAttack lines that she is certain to face on the campaign trail have already begun to be aired. She is a traitor to her country, is the most predictable iteration, followed by conspiracy theories that she is in the pay of the Russians attempting to destabilize a sitting Democratic senator.\n\nAgain she appears unfazed. \u201cEverybody is a traitor these days. James Comey, Hillary Clinton, Trump, Obama \u2026 the word has no meaning any more. Any form of \u2018I don\u2019t agree with you\u2019 becomes \u2018treason\u2019, and in that kind of society we can\u2019t have debates.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, to whom she leaked the documents in 2010, are also certain to be invoked against her. What does she say now of WikiLeaks?\n\n\u201cI made a decision in 2010 to release the documents. I reached out to the New York Times and the Washington Post, I ran out of time, and that was the decision I made. I can\u2019t change that.\u201d\n\nHas she had any contact with Assange since the data transfer?\n\nPerhaps the most serious charge so far has come from the right. The Conservative Review wrote that the Manning v Cardin battle \u201cbenefits the Republican party tremendously.

There is no evidence to support those who scaremonger about the effects of making the rich pay fairer tax.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201c Not only have the Tories slashed the top rate of tax, they still plan billions in tax giveaways to the super rich and big corporations over this parliament.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite claims from ministers that Labour\u2019s tax plans would be both politically and economically damaging, McDonnell believes higher taxes for the rich would be both workable and popular.\n\n\u201cWith every day that passes the case for a change of direction at the Treasury grows. Instead of engaging in infighting in his own party the chancellor should listen to Labour\u2019s calls for fairer taxes and increased investment, so we will build an economy for the many not the few.\u201d\n\nTheresa May has repeatedly attacked Labour\u2019s approach as extreme, claiming in prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday that Corbyn and McDonnell are on \u201cplanet Venezuela\u201d.\n\nBut the prime minister conceded at a fringe meeting at her party\u2019s conference in Manchester that public opinion appears to be more favourable to some of Labour\u2019s economic ideas than Conservative strategists had assumed in the run-up to June\u2019s general election.\n\n\u201cWe thought there was a political consensus,\u201d she said. \u201cJeremy Corbyn changed that\u201d.\n\nWith Philip Hammond due to deliver his budget next month, it is unclear whether the government will press ahead with promised tax cuts for higher earners, including plans to increase the higher rate threshold for income tax to \u00a350,000.\n\nThe fiscal monitor does not mention any country by name and does not specify at what level governments should set the new higher rate for top earners. But the report stressed that cutting tax for the top 1% had gone too far - a strong hint that the IMF has doubts about the pro-rich tax plan proposed by Donald Trump for the US.\n\nInstead, the IMF said higher tax for the rich was necessary to arrest rising income inequality \u2013 the argument used by McDonnell and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThe fiscal monitor said most advanced economies in the West had experienced a sizeable increase in income inequality in the past three decades, driven primarily by the growing income of the top 1%.\n\nTraditionally, governments have sought to make their societies less unequal by levying higher income tax rates on the rich and using the proceeds to help those less well off either directly or through public services.\n\nBut it found that income tax systems had become markedly less progressive in the 1980s and 1990s and had remained stable since then, even though growing inequality raised the need for a more progressive approach.\n\nIn an IMF blog, the head of the IMF\u2019s fiscal affairs unit, Vitor Gaspar, said the average top income tax rate for the rich country members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development had fallen from 62% in 1981 to 35% in 2015.\n\n\u201cIn addition, tax systems are less progressive than indicated by the statutory rates, because wealthy individuals have more access to tax relief,\u201d Gaspar said in the blog co-written with Mercedes Garcia-Escribano. \u201cImportantly, we find that some advanced economies can increase progressivity without hampering growth, as long as progressivity is not excessive.\u201d\n\nIMF research found that between 1985 and 1995, redistribution through the tax system had offset 60% of the increase in inequality caused by market forces. But between 1995 and 2010, income tax systems failed to respond to the continuing increase in inequality.\n\nIt also said inequality should be tackled by giving a more pro-poor slant to public spending.\n\n\u201cDespite progress, gaps in access to quality education and healthcare services between different income groups in the population remain in many countries,\u201d Gaspar and Garcia-Escribano said, adding that in rich countries men with university education lived up to 14 years longer than those with secondary education or less.\n\n\u201cBetter public spending can help, for instance, by reallocating education or health spending from the rich to the poor while keeping total public education or health spending unchanged,\u201d they added.\n\nIn its separate global financial stability review, the IMF said it would take several years for central banks to return interest rates to more normal levels due to the risk of aborting recovery.\n\nBut the report also highlighted the risk that prolonged monetary support could lead to the buildup of further financial excesses. Too much money was chasing too few assets offering a yield, the IMF said.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cA fair tax system is a critical part of our plan to build a fairer society. Today, the richest 1% pay over a quarter of all income tax while 4 million of the lower earners have been taken out of income tax altogether.\u201d"}, "http://gp.org/cgi-bin/vote/propdetail?pid=820": {"title": "Green Party of the United States - National Committee Voting - Proposal Details", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://gp.org/cgi-bin/vote/propdetail?pid=820", "text": "48 0.6666 of Yes and No Votes"}, "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/357549-milo-yiannopoulos-no-longer-appearing-at-phoenix-event-after-62": {"title": "Milo Yiannopoulos no longer attending Phoenix event after venues decline to host him", "keywords": ["Milo Yiannopoulos", "", ""], "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/357549-milo-yiannopoulos-no-longer-appearing-at-phoenix-event-after-62", "text": "Conservative provocateur and former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos will no longer attend a planned event in Phoenix after dozens of venues denied hosting the event.\n\nThe Phoenix New Times reported that the United Liberty Coalition, a Phoenix-based constitutionalist group, had reached out to \u201cat least 65\u201d venues to host the event, 62 of which declined.

But some of the human workers who share the factory with their robotic counterparts complain of grueling pressure \u2013 which they attribute to Musk\u2019s aggressive production goals \u2013 and sometimes life-changing injuries.\n\nAmbulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, dizziness, seizures, abnormal breathing and chest pains, according to incident reports obtained by the Guardian. Hundreds more were called for injuries and other medical issues.\n\nIn a phone interview about the conditions at the factory, which employs about 10,000 workers, the Tesla CEO conceded his workers had been \u201chaving a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs\u201d, but said he cared deeply about their health and wellbeing. His company says its factory safety record has significantly improved over the last year.\n\nMusk also said that Tesla should not be compared to major US carmakers and that its market capitalization, now more than $50bn, is unwarranted. \u201cI do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve,\u201d he said, pointing out his company produces just 1% of GM\u2019s total output.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a money-losing company,\u201d Musk added. \u201cThis is not some situation where, for example, we are just greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on safety in order to have more profits and dividends and that kind of thing. It\u2019s just a question of how much money we lose. And how do we survive? How do we not die and have everyone lose their jobs?\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s account of the company\u2019s approach differs from that of the 15 current and former factory workers who told the Guardian of a culture of long hours under intense pressure, sometimes through pain and injury, in order to fulfill the CEO\u2019s ambitious production goals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people pass out, hit the floor like a pancake and smash their face open,\u201d said Jonathan Galescu, a production technician at Tesla. \u201cThey just send us to work around him while he\u2019s still lying on the floor.\u201d\n\nHe was one of several workers who said they had seen co-workers collapse or be taken away in ambulances. \u201cWe had an associate on my line, he just kept working, kept working, kept working, next thing you know \u2013 he just fell on the ground,\u201d said Mikey Catura, a worker on the battery pack line.\n\nRichard Ortiz, another production worker, spoke admiringly of the high-tech shop floor. \u201cIt\u2019s like you died and went to auto-worker heaven.\u201d But he added: \u201cEverything feels like the future but us.\u201d\n\nTesla sits at the juncture between a tech startup, untethered from the rules of the old economy, and a manufacturer that needs to produce physical goods. Nowhere is that contradiction more apparent than at the Tesla factory, where Musk\u2019s bombastic projection that his company will make 500,000 cars in 2018 (a 495% increase from 2016) relies as much on the sweat and muscle of thousands of human workers as it does on futuristic robots.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve gathered, Elon Musk started Tesla kind of like an app startup, and didn\u2019t realize that it isn\u2019t just nerds at a computer desk typing,\u201d said one production worker, one of several who asked not to be identified by name. \u201cYou really start losing the startup feel when you have thousands of people doing physical labor.\u201d\n\nIn February, Tesla worker Jose Moran published a blogpost that detailed allegations of mandatory overtime, high rates of injury and low wages at the factory, and revealed that workers were seeking to unionize with the United Auto Workers.\n\nMoran\u2019s post shone a spotlight on a workforce that is almost entirely absent from Tesla\u2019s official images of the factory.\n\nMichael Sanchez once had two dreams: to be an artist and a car service technician. He said he was \u201cecstatic\u201d when he was recruited five years ago to work at Tesla, a company he believed was \u201cpart of the future\u201d.\n\nNow Sanchez has two herniated discs in his neck, is on disability leave from work, and can no longer grip a pencil without pain.\n\nTesla said that the employee\u2019s injury occurred while he was installing a wheel, but Sanchez said it was caused by the years he spent working on Tesla\u2019s assembly line. The cars he worked on were suspended above the line, and his job required looking up and working with his hands above his head all day.\n\n\u201cYou can make it through Monday,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cYou can make it through Tuesday. Come Wednesday, you start to feel something. Thursday is pain. Friday is agonizing. Saturday you\u2019re just making it through the day.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s manufacturing practices appear to have been most dangerous in its earliest years of operations. The company does not dispute that its recordable incident rate (TRIR), an official measure of injuries and illnesses that is reported to workplace safety regulators, was above the industry average between 2013 and 2016.\n\nTesla declined to release data over those four years, saying such information \u201cdoesn\u2019t reflect how the factory operates today\u201d.\n\nThe company did release more recent data, which indicates its record of safety incidents went from slightly above the industry average in late 2016, to a performance in the first few months of 2017 that was 32% better than average. The company said that its decision to add a third shift, introduce a dedicated team of ergonomics experts, and improvements to the factory\u2019s \u201csafety teams\u201d account for the significant reduction in incidents since last year.\n\nMusk said safety was paramount at the company. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hurtful, and, I think, false for anyone to claim that I don\u2019t care.\u201d The CEO said his desk was \u201cin the worst place in the factory, the most painful place\u201d, in keeping with his management philosophy. \u201cIt\u2019s not some comfortable corner office.\u201d\n\nIn early 2016, he said, he slept on the factory floor in a sleeping bag \u201cto make it the most painful thing possible\u201d. \u201cI knew people were having a hard time, working long hours, and on hard jobs. I wanted to work harder than they did, to put even more hours in,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what I think a manager should do.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we believe in a sustainable energy future, trying to accelerate the advent of clean transport and clean energy production, not because we think this is a way to get rich.\u201d\n\nTesla workers who spoke to the Guardian echoed this sense of pride and enthusiasm for the company\u2019s mission. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the world,\u201d enthused Ortiz. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for my granddaughter to one day go to class and say, \u2018My grandfather was in there.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut that pride did not erase what Ortiz described as a prevailing mood of \u201cmass disappointment\u201d over working conditions and what he alleged were avoidable work-related injuries.\n\nHe recently lost the strength in his right arm, a situation he said was \u201cscaring\u201d him. \u201cI want to use my arm when I\u2019m retired,\u201d he added.\n\nOthers described repetitive stress injuries they linked to working long hours. Before the company reduced the average time of a workday in October 2016, workers said they routinely worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week. Tesla said the change had been \u201ca success\u201d, and resulted in a 50% decline in overtime hours.\n\nSanchez and other workers said they believed more injuries occurred because, for years, the company did not take worker safety seriously, with some managers belittling their complaints and pressuring them to work through pain.\n\n\n\nWhen workers told managers about pain, Sanchez said they responded: \u201cWe all hurt. You can\u2019t man up?\u201d Alan Ochoa, another Tesla worker who is currently on a medical leave with an injury, alleged that superiors \u201cput the production numbers ahead of the safety and wellbeing of the employees\u201d.\n\nThe company said that Ochoa and Sanchez are especially outspoken workers whose views do not represent the wider workforce. However, the Tesla spokesperson added: \u201cIn a factory of more than 10,000 employees, there will always be isolated incidents that we would like to avoid.\u201d\n\nComplaints about working conditions at Tesla are not universal. \u201cI\u2019ve got benefits, I\u2019ve got stocks, I\u2019ve got [paid time off],\u201d said a worker who has been at the company for about a year. \u201cI thoroughly enjoy my work and I feel I\u2019m treated fairly.\u201d\n\nAnother worker, a temporary employee, said that he sees some teams in the factory doing group stretches in the morning to prevent injuries.\n\nHowever, some Tesla workers argue the company\u2019s treatment of injured workers discourages them from reporting their injuries. If workers are assigned to \u201clight duty\u201d work because of an injury, they are paid a lower wage as well as supplemental benefits from workers\u2019 compensation insurance, a practice that Tesla said was in line with other employers and California law. Tesla said some injured employees are also able to undertake \u201cmodified work\u201d on regular pay.\n\n\u201cI went from making $22 an hour to $10 an hour,\u201d said a production worker, who injured his back twice while working at Tesla. \u201cIt kind of forces people to go back to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one wants to get a pay cut because they\u2019re injured, so everyone just forces themselves to work through it,\u201d added Adam Suarez, who has worked at the factory for about three years.\n\nTesla said it was determined to further improve its safety standards. \u201cWhile some amount of injuries is inevitable, our goal at Tesla is to have as close to zero injuries as possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry worldwide,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nMusk has a well-documented tendency to promise Mars and deliver the moon. His electric car company was, by his own admission, a gamble. Musk said starting a car manufacturer from scratch was likely \u201cthe worst way to earn money, honestly\u201d, though he caveated that \u201cmaybe rockets are a bit worse\u201d. He said: \u201cOn a risk-adjusted return basis, an auto company has to be the dumbest thing you could possibly start.\u201d\n\nThe company has succeeded at increasing its production rate every quarter. In the first three months of 2017, the factory produced more than 25,000 cars \u2013 a Tesla record. To meet Musk\u2019s goal for 2018, they will have to quintuple that rate.\n\n\u201cI think one of the major problems is that people at the top are making unrealistic quarterly goals,\u201d said a worker on the battery pack line.\n\nThree workers described a management tactic of assigning a monetary value to every delay on the assembly line. \u201cOne time the robot came down and [the supervisor] came back screaming at us, \u2018That\u2019s $18,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000 because you guys can\u2019t get this done,\u2019\u201d Gelascu recalled.\n\nTesla argues the challenge in building vehicles from scratch with new production and manufacturing methods should not be underestimated, but that \u201cnothing is more important\u201d than protecting the health and safety of its workers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do good for the world and we believe in doing the right thing,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd that extends to caring about the health and safety of everyone at the company.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a more humanistic tone than the one he strikes with investors. \u201cYou really can\u2019t have people in the production line itself. Otherwise you\u2019ll automatically drop to people speed,\u201d he told investors in an earnings call last year. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of people at the factory, but what they\u2019re doing is maintaining the machines, upgrading them, dealing with anomalies. But in the production process itself there essentially would be no people.\u201d\n\nThis article was amended to include details of Tesla\u2019s \u201cmodified work\u201d program for injured workers."}, "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/US-War-on-Terror-Leaves-1.3-Million-Dead-in-Three-Countries-20150330-0011.html": {"title": "US War on Terror Leaves 1.3 Million Dead in 3 Countries", "keywords": ["War on terror", " United States", " Physicians for Social Reponsibility", " Body Count"], "url": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/US-War-on-Terror-Leaves-1.3-Million-Dead-in-Three-Countries-20150330-0011.html", "text": ""}, "http://www.redspark.nu/en/peoples-war/india/india-brought-to-standstill-as-millions-join-strike/": {"title": "India brought to standstill as millions join strike \u2013 Redspark", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.redspark.nu/en/peoples-war/india/india-brought-to-standstill-as-millions-join-strike/", "text": "Essential services such as urban transport and banking have been affected across the country.\n\nUrban transport and other public services have ground to a halt in India, as millions of people have joined a nationwide strike.\n\nThe 24-hour strike will see essential services such as ports, civil aviation, telecom and banking services across the country coming to a standstill.\n\nIt is being carried out by 10 trade unions to protest against the government\u2019s \u201cindifference\u201d to their demands for better wages and its \u201canti-people\u201d policies.\n\nWorkers in the textile, engineering, coal, steel and electricity sectors have also joined the strike.\n\nUnion leaders have claimed that the strike will be bigger than the one held on the same day last year, with more than 180 million people participating.\n\nThe southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are among the hardest-hit.\n\n\u201cThis time strike will be bigger than last year as 180 million workers from formal and informal sectors would come on streets to protest against government\u2019s indifference,\u201d Trade Union Coordination Committee general secretary S P Tiwari told the Press Trust of India.\n\n\u201cBesides ports and civil aviation, essential services like transport, telecom and banking will be paralysed.\n\n\u201cWorkers will go on strike in hospitals and power plants but the protest will not affect their normal functioning.\u201d\n\nLabour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said the government had agreed to seven of 12 demands raised by unions.\n\n\u201cThe seven demands include wage revision, bonus for workers\u2026 and social security,\u201d he was reported as saying.\n\nA senior police official told The Hindu newspaper that security would be deployed at bus stops and railway stations across the country to ensure services are not disrupted by protesters.\n\nLong-distance mail and express trains are reported to be operating normally.\n\nDattatreya blamed the previous Congress government for the strike and said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government did not desire a confrontation with unions.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on development of working conditions, health, wage, job security and social security,\u201d he was quoted as saying by The Hindustan Times.\n\n\u201cWe had a discussion with trade unions.

Blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d\n\nWith their crass antics on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Scarborough and Brzezinski often come off being almost as juvenile as Trump, though the president\u2019s Tweets exhibit a clinical pathology that Joe and Mika can only aspire to. Trump\u2019s boorish reference to Brzezinski\u2019s facelift confirms, from his very own micro-digits, the stories that have been floating around for years that Trump has routinely spied on celebrity and political guests at his properties, collecting damaging information that he could later weaponize against them through disparaging Tweets or leaks to his pals at the National Enquirer.\n\nIt only took an hour or so for Trump\u2019s Tweets to detonate paroxysms of mock outrage in official Washington, with the Republican congressional leadership (the same group of moral exemplars that wants to pitch 22 million people off their meager health care plans) scrambling for the microphones to denounce the president for sullying the \u201cdignity\u201d of the Oval Office. (Bill Clinton must have chuckled at that one.)\n\nContrast the almost universal indignation over Trump\u2019s warped Tweets with the complete lack of attention paid to the 500 civilians US airstrikes in Syria have killed in the last month, real bloodshed that is treated as merely being part of the presidential job description. Despite Trump\u2019s own warning a mere two years ago that \u201cwe should stay out of Syria,\u201d he now finds himself hip-deep in Syrian blood with no apparent aversion to his predicament. I\u2019m not sure about the percentage of bleeding women amid the daily carnage in Syria, though it seems to be enough to whet Trump\u2019s appetite for destruction.\n\nTo the extent that Trump can be decoded, I suggest that people have dangerously misunderstood his foreign policy and his position on NATO, in particular. The confusion is pardonable to an extent, because it\u2019s not at all clear that Trump himself understands the details or even the vague outlines of his geopolitical strategy. He\u2019s left all that to the generals (and the homunculus of the White House Stephen Miller). The Trump administration isn\u2019t pursuing a reduced US commitment to the provocation of Russia in eastern Europe (or in Syria for that matter), but a demand for an increase in military spending by European countries, as evidenced in the recent capitulation to his demands by Canada and other EU countries.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to interpret the real aims of Trump foreign policy by reading Nikki Haley\u2019s Tweets rather than Donald\u2019s inspired musings. Haley is Samantha Power on steroids, except we know that Haley (the book-keeper turned war minister) isn\u2019t coming up with these belligerent communiqu\u00e9s on her own. The script is being written by the likes of Mike Pompeo and HR McMaster.\n\nIn a bizarre episode on Monday evening, the White House announced that it was putting the Assad regime on notice about chemical weapons use. White House press secretary Sean Spicer claimed that \u201cthe United States has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children. If Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price.\u201d\n\nIn drawing this sharp red line, Spicer refused to identify the source of the intelligence or comment any plans the Trump administration might have to counter the attacks. For his part, Trump preferred to Tweet smack at Obama for his failure to stop the Russians from meddling in the 2016 elections. Heh, heh\u2026\n\nThat left it up to Nikki Haley, who seized the opportunity for dramatic escalation. In her testimony before Congress on Tuesday morning, Haley pushed the doomsday clock forward a few precious minutes when she pointed her pious finger at both Russia and Iran. \u201cThe goal is at this point not just to send Assad a message, but to send Russia and Iran a message,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThat if this happens again, we are putting you on notice. My hope is that the president\u2019s warning will certainly get Iran and Russia to take a second look, and I hope that it will caution Assad.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s bellicose bluster prompted the Russians to respond in kind. The Kremlin warned that if the US launched a preemptive strike against Assad, its forces in the region would respond in kind\u2013a case where tit-for-tat posturing could escalate to Armageddon.\n\nHowever, by the next afternoon, this entire mysterious interlude had been quietly swept under the rug by Gen. Jim \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis himself, who told reporters on a flight to the NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels that \u201cIt appears that the Syrians took the warning seriously said. They didn\u2019t do it.\u201d The Syrians claimed they never had any intention of launching a chemical attack and US intelligence officials speaking anonymously to Reuters backed them up.\n\nSo what was this bizarre burst of prime-time war-mongering all about? Was it a distraction from the unraveling of the Senate\u2019s calamitous version of TrumpCare? Was it an aborted power-play by the anti-Iran hardliners in the West Wing looking to cook up a pretext for the next war?\n\nI think the answer is much simpler and dumber. The White House issued its impromptu warning about a planned Syrian chemical weapon attack at about the same time an explosive story by renowned investigative journalist Seymour Hersh went live on the site of the German newspaper Die Welt. Hersh\u2019s story details how the Trump White House swallowed a false narrative about sarin gas being used to kill civilians in an ISIS-held town called Khan Sheikhoun and then using this as a pretext to launch a cruise missile attack on a Syrian air base, flouting the warnings of his own military and intelligence advisors. Hersh\u2019s rigorously-sourced story is a devastating account of how a reckless and deranged inner circle in the Trump White House nearly brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nHersh\u2019s expos\u00e9 is a must-read, a landmark piece of investigative reporting. And you can easily understand why the Team Trump would have been desperate to see the story buried in a whirlwind of manufactured hysteria about a new chemical weapons attack. But they needn\u2019t have bothered. Few people were going to be aware of Hersh\u2019s piece in any event. That\u2019s because Sy Hersh, the man who exposed My Lai, domestic spying by the CIA and the abuses at Abu Ghraib, has been effectively blacklisted in the US and now even Great Britain. Hersh\u2019s piece on Syria had been commissioned by the London Review of Books, which has a dedicated if minor global readership. But at the last minute the LRB shamefully lost its nerve and rejected the story. The LRB\u2019s editor Mary-Kay Wilmers claimed in an email sent to CounterPunch that \u201cthe piece was fact-checked and didn\u2019t stand up.\u201d\n\nThis is a disgraceful swipe at one of the world\u2019s best journalists and is evidence of just how degraded the LRB\u2019s once glittering reputation has become. Recall that Hersh\u2019s first book, even before his My Lai reporting, was America\u2019s Hidden Arsenal, a ground-breaking trip into the US\u2019s biological and chemical weapons program. He has been covering this story his entire professional career.\n\nMy friend Chase Madar, the very smart lawyer and writer, told me this week that he believed there was always a greater risk of Trump initiating a conflict with Russia than Clinton. I think he\u2019s right. With Clinton the risk was calculable and predictable. You pretty much knew exactly where the fault lines and pressure points were. But Trump is the man without inhibitions, who will not be impeded by any societal norms. He is impetuous, vain and stupid and could easily be bullied by his generals or political opponents into starting a war against almost anyone: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Oregon\u2013maybe all five at once. That\u2019s why for the sake of world peace I hope Putin does have that smut dossier on Trump. Sex Tape Deterrence. You didn\u2019t read about that survival strategy in Herman Kahn\u2019s On Thermonuclear War.\n\nI used to believe, naively it turns out, that rightwing militarism would be countered by a liberated and reanimated anti-war movement, a movement that had disgracefully refused to confront wars launched by liberal politicians from JFK to Obama.\n\nBut where is it now? Where are the mass protests against Trump\u2019s expanding wars in Syria, Yemen, Somalia and the re-surge in Afghanistan? Where are the protests against the rising slaughter of civilians? The swelling threat of nuclear confrontation?\n\nThe liberal antiwar movement (if there ever was such an entity) has shriveled into an anti-Russia claque, aligning itself fatally with some of the most bloodthirsty hawks on the Hill and in doing so is abetting every drone strike, cruise missile and MOAB bomb Trump drops.

The defendants were urging a judge to dismiss their case and accused California police and prosecutors of a \u201ccover-up and collusion with the fascists\u201d.\n\nDefense lawyers said the case at the state capital offers the latest example of US law enforcement appearing to align with neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups while targeting anti-fascist activists and Donald Trump protesters after violent clashes.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking and really angering to see the level of collusion and the amount to which the police covered up for the Nazis,\u201d said Yvette Felarca, a Berkeley teacher and anti-fascist organizer charged with assault and rioting after participating in the June 2016 Sacramento rally, where she said she was stabbed and bludgeoned in the head. \u201cThe people who were victimized by the Nazis were then victimized by the police and the district attorneys.\u201d\n\nSteve Grippi, chief deputy district attorney prosecuting the case in Sacramento, vehemently denied the claims of bias in an email to the Guardian, alleging that anti-fascist stabbing victims have been uncooperative and noting that his office has filed charges against one member of the Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP), the neo-Nazi group that organized the rally.\n\nSome California highway patrol (CHP) investigation records, however, raise questions about the police\u2019s investigative tactics and communication with the TWP.\n\nFelarca\u2019s attorneys obtained numerous examples of CHP officers working directly with the TWP, often treating the white nationalist group as victims and the anti-fascists as suspects.\n\nThe TWP is \u201cintimately allied with neo-Nazi and other hardline racist organizations\u201d and \u201cadvocates for racially pure nations\u201d, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Its leaders have praised Trump, and the group claimed to bring more than 100 people to the Charlottesville white supremacist rally, where a counter-protester was killed.\n\nIn one phone call with Doug McCormack, identified by police as the TWP affiliate who acquired the permit for the Sacramento rally, CHP investigator Donovan Ayres warned him that police might have to release his name in response to a public records requests. The officer said he would try to protect McCormack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna suggest that we hold that or redact your name or something until this gets resolved,\u201d Ayres told McCormack, adding that he didn\u2019t know who had requested records of the permit and noting, \u201cIf I did, I would tell you.\u201d\n\nAyres\u2019s reports noted that McCormack was armed at the rally with a knife.\n\nThe officer\u2019s write-up about an African American anti-fascist activist included a photo of him at the hospital after the rally and noted that he had been stabbed in the abdomen, chest and hand.\n\nAyres, however, treated the protester like a suspect in the investigation. The police investigator recommended the man be charged with 11 offenses, including disturbing the peace, conspiracy, assault, unlawful assembly and wearing a mask to evade police.\n\nAs evidence, Ayres provided Facebook photos of the man holding up his fist. The officer wrote that the man\u2019s \u201cBlack Power salute\u201d and his \u201csupport for anti-racist activism\u201d demonstrated his \u201cintent and motivation to violate the civil rights\u201d of the neo-Nazi group. He was ultimately not charged.\n\nAyres\u2019s report also noted Felarca\u2019s political activism in great detail, referencing her activism on behalf of students of color and women\u2019s rights protests.\n\n\u201cThis is a textbook case of a political witch-hunt and selective prosecution,\u201d Shanta Driver, one of Felarca\u2019s attorneys, said in an interview.\n\nOfficers also worked with TWP member Derik Punneo to try to identify anti-fascist activists, recordings revealed. Officers interviewed Punneo in jail after he was arrested for an unrelated domestic violence charge. Audio recordings captured investigators saying they brought photos to show him, hoping he could help them identify anti-fascist activists.\n\nThe officers said, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much going after them,\u201d and assured him: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at you as a victim.\u201d\n\nAyres\u2019s report noted that Punneo was armed with a knife at the neo-Nazi rally and that one stabbing victim told officers he believed Punneo was responsible. Using video footage, Ayres also noted that Punneo was \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of another victim at the time he was injured, but the officer said the evidence ultimately wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nPunneo and McCormack, who could not be reached for comment, were not charged. Ayres\u2019s report included images and names of three other TWP-affiliated men who he said were armed with knives, but who also have faced no charges.\n\nIn a response filed on Thursday, prosecutors said \u201cevery assertion\u201d in the motion to dismiss is \u201cinaccurate or fabricated\u201d and accused Felarca\u2019s lawyers of using the filing to \u201cmake a political statement\u201d. The response also repeatedly blamed the stabbing victims for ignoring the district attorney\u2019s inquiries: \u201cDespite the fact that we have not gained the cooperation of these victims, the investigation to hold their attackers responsible continues forward.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also said the charges were based on video evidence and argued that \u201cno one is beneath the protection of the law, no matter how repugnant his or her rhetoric or misguided his or her ideals\u201d.\n\nAllegations of police bias and collusion with neo-Nazis have emerged in similar cases across the US. Last year, US prosecutors targeting anti-Trump protesters in Washington DC relied on video evidence from a far-right group with a record of deceptive tactics.\n\nAt an Oregon \u201calt-right\u201d event, police allowed a member of a rightwing militia-style group to help officers arrest an anti-fascist activist.\n\nPolice in Charlottesville were widely accused of standing by as Nazis attacked protesters, and a black man who was badly beaten by white supremacists was later charged with a felony.\n\nSam Menefee-Libey, an activist who advocated for protesters charged for Inauguration Day rallies last year, said the government has repeatedly gone to great lengths to target anti-fascists: \u201cWe have patterns of acknowledged and unacknowledged overlaps between the interest of ultra-right nationalist organizations and the police and prosecutors\u2019 offices.\u201d"}, "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-democratic-socialists-20170308-story.html": {"title": "Seeing red: Membership triples for the Democratic Socialists of America", "keywords": ["socialists", " Donald Trump", " politics", ""], "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-democratic-socialists-20170308-story.html", "text": "\"The farthest they can go is supporting elements such as Bernie Sanders,\" Marc Wells, a Trotskyist, said disdainfully as he handed out leaflets for the World Socialist Web Site at the International Women's Day strike in Los Angeles, where some Democratic Socialists of America members had also gathered.

They were chanting \u201cBlood not soil\u201d [sic], a well-known Nazi\u2014\u201dBlood and soil,\u201d a well-known Nazi phrase, \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d and \u201cJew will not replace us\u201d and \u201cWhite lives matter.\u201d\n\nWe continue our hour-long discussion. We\u2019re joined in Charlottesville by Virginia\u2014Jalane Schmidt, an organizer with the local Black Lives Matter movement and associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia. Here in New York, we\u2019re joined by Dr. Cornel West, professor of the practice of public philosophy at Harvard University, who was in Charlottesville. And in St. Louis, we\u2019re joined by Reverend Traci Blackmon, executive minister of Justice and Witness Ministries of the United Church of Christ, who was also in Charlottesville this weekend.\n\nCornel West, talk about what you saw Friday night. You were there at\u2014in a church. You were speaking along with others. Did you expect to see what you saw outside?\n\nCORNEL WEST: No, no. I knew I was going to hear a powerful sermon by my dear sister Reverend Dr. Traci Blackmon, and we heard one. We heard poignant words by Professor Jalane Schmidt. And I had a few things to say. It was a beautiful moment\u2014all colors, all religious traditions, Muslims, Jews, Christians, black, white, red, indigenous peoples. And we should never downplay the vicious attack on gay brothers, lesbian sisters, bisexuals and trans folk, that was part of the chanting that took place the next day.\n\nBut what happened was, they held us hostage in the church. We could not leave after the service, because the torch march threatening the people who were there. And so, in that sense, I said, \u201cHmmm, boy, these neofascists, they\u2019re out of control. Where are the police?\u201d And who would think that our dear sister Heather, my dear comrade, who also was with IWW\u2014you know, that\u2019s very important. She was an organizer. She stood with us on Saturday. She paid the ultimate price. And many of us may have to pay that ultimate price.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to Reverend Traci Blackmon, but first to your MSNBC interview on Saturday, when you were in [Charlottesville], when you were rushed off the live shot as people around you were attacked. Let\u2019s go to that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was\u2014that was Joy Reid of MSNBC, as [Traci] Blackmon was whisked away by an ally right there on the set. Reverend Blackmon, what happened then?\n\nREV. TRACI BLACKMON: Well, I was giving the interview for Joy Reid\u2014and thank you for having me here. And I also want to echo my condolences, my deepest sympathy to the family of Heather and to the family of the law enforcement officers who also lost their lives in this unnecessary, tragic event. Joy Reid had invited me on her show to talk about what had happened at the church the night before. And they were not aware of what was happening in Charlottesville until I began to make some calls to let people know that Charlottesville was under attack. They immediately sent a team out to cover. And their news team was stationed inside the perimeter of the events that were happening Saturday. And so, I was asked to come and do an interview. And with the permission of local people on the scene, the community organizers from Charlottesville\u2014I asked them first\u2014I was given permission to do that interview. And in the midst of the interview, we began to hear pops. And I didn\u2019t know what those pops were. I still don\u2019t know what those pops were. But the security that was there rushed me off from the camera. I really didn\u2019t know what was happening in that moment.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s Reverend Traci Blackmon, who\u2019s speaking to us now from St. Louis, who was in Charlottesville this weekend, on Friday night addressing people in the church, and on Saturday on the street. Professor Jalane Schmidt is also with us. And you\u2019re with Black Lives Matter. You were very involved with the organizing around what took place. Can you tell us what happened this weekend, what you understood was going to happen, how people organized, and the kind of response by all of the authorities? Jalane Schmidt is just being seated right now, so let me go to Cornel West. I heard\u2014well, The Guardian reported that people that night, who were responding to the torch march, were actually attacked with swung torches, pepper spray and lighter fluid.\n\nCORNEL WEST: Absolutely. You had a number of the courageous students, of all colors, at the University of Virginia who were protesting against the neofascists themselves. The neofascists had their own ammunition. And this is very important to keep in mind, because the police, for the most part, pulled back. The next day, for example, those 20 of us who were standing, many of them clergy, we would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists who approached, over 300, 350 anti-fascists. We just had 20. And we\u2019re singing \u201cThis Little light of Mine,\u201d you know what I mean? So that the\u2014\n\nCORNEL WEST: The anti-fascists, and then, crucial, the anarchists, because they saved our lives, actually. We would have been completely crushed, and I\u2019ll never forget that. Meaning what? Meaning that you had the police holding back, on the one hand, so we couldn\u2019t even get arrested. We were there to get arrested. We couldn\u2019t get arrested, because the police had pulled back, and just allowing fellow citizens to go at each other, you see, and with all of the consequences that would follow therefrom.\n\nSo, in that sense, you know, I think what we\u2019re really seeing, though, Sister Amy, is the American empire in decay, with the rule of big money, with massive militarism, facilitated by the scapegoating of the most vulnerable, of immigrants, Muslims, Jews, Arabs, gay, lesbians, trans and bisexuals, and black folk. The white supremacy was so intense. I\u2019ve never seen that kind of hatred in my life. We stood there, and nine units went by, and looking right in our eyes. And they\u2019re cussing me out, and so forth and so on. They\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t lose my holy ghost, to tell you the truth, because I wanted to start swinging myself. I\u2019m a Christian, but not a pacifist, you know. But I held back. But that kind of hatred\u2014but that is just the theater. It\u2019s big money. It\u2019s big military. And it\u2019s the way in which this capitalist civilization is leading us toward unbelievable darkness and bleakness. And the beautiful thing is the fightback. It was a beautiful thing to see all the people coming back. But they had more fascists than anarchists, more fascists than fightback."}, "https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/16/man-als-who-confronted-flake-plane-has-just-one-birthday-wish-massive-day-action": {"title": "Man With ALS Who Confronted Flake on Plane Has Just One Birthday Wish: 'A Massive Day of Action to Kill the #GOPTaxScam'", "keywords": ["Rights", " Solutions", " U.S.", " Taxation", " Susan Collins", " Republican Party", " People Power"], "url": "https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/16/man-als-who-confronted-flake-plane-has-just-one-birthday-wish-massive-day-action", "text": "Ady Barkan\u2014the 33-year-old political activist who last week seized a chance enounter on an airplane to confront Republican Senator Jeff Flake from his home state of Arizona over the pending tax overhaul legislation\u2014is having a birthday on Monday, but this year he only has one wish: For people nationwide to rise up and raise hell in opposition to what has become known as the \"GOP tax scam.\"\n\n\"Monday is my 34th birthday.

About half said they considered the American dream alive and well for them personally. About half said it was dead as a doornail.\n\nHarvard also asked millennials about a number of other issues, too; people in that age bracket like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders more than other Republicans and Democrats, for example. But this bit of data on the American Dream stood out.\n\nParticularly in light of data released on Thursday by Pew Research. Pew found that the beating heart of the American dream, the middle class, has shrunk significantly over the past 40 years.\n\nThe middle class is now smaller than the upper and lower economic classes, in Pew's analysis, and holds less aggregate income than the upper class.\n\nNo wonder, then, that young Americans are skeptical of their ability to get ahead. Pew's data also shows that the age range looked at in the Harvard IoP survey saw the biggest drop in income status since 1971, with the biggest gain of any demographic group going to those 65 and over.\n\nWithin that American dream data was a noticeable split. Those with a college degree thought that the American dream was alive and well at a rate 16 percentage points higher than those who weren't in college or who had never attended. Non-college-graduates also saw broad decreases in income in Pew's analysis, with the research firm writing that \"[t]hose Americans without a college degree stand out as experiencing a substantial loss in economic status.\"\n\nWe've known for some time that people with college degrees have done better in recent years. But two threats still exist. The first is student loan debt, which continues to be a massive burden to recent college graduates. The second is wage stagnation. In analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, for example, wages for young college graduates have been dropping since the year 2000. The trend is more widespread and older than that, but this number certainly might make a new graduate pessimistic.\n\nThe idea of the American dream is somewhat nebulous, relating mostly to the idea of the equal opportunity for economic success. Half of people under the age of 30 are skeptical of that idea, and even those with a college degree might still see clouds on the horizon. The results of Harvard's survey aren't surprising, even if we might think they should be."}, "http://www.thepetitionsite.com/898/027/102/voice-your-support-for-the-green-party-of-the-united-states-becoming-anti-capitalist/#sign": {"title": "Sign Petition: Voice Your Support for the Green Party of the United States Becoming Anti-Capitalist!", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.thepetitionsite.com/898/027/102/voice-your-support-for-the-green-party-of-the-united-states-becoming-anti-capitalist/#sign", "text": "UPDATE: This amendment has passed!

This workplace grassroots democracy has been largely absent from the Green platform, and many believe it is the way forward for a truly ecological economy and a new system. This new platform plank does not promote expropriation of privately owned small businesses and should not be interpreted as such. Rather, the plank outlines the type of businesses and type of economy we would like to create. \n\n\n\nPROPOSAL: To amend Chapter IV. Economic Justice and Sustainability 1. Ecological Economics Paragraph 4 Current language of plank that is being addressed: \u201cSustaining our quality of life, economic prosperity, environmental health, and long\u00adterm survival demands that we adopt new ways of doing business. We need to remake commerce to encourage diversity and variety, responding to the enormous complexity of global and local conditions. Big business is not about appropriateness and adaptability, but about power and market control. Greens support small business, responsible stakeholder capitalism, and broad and diverse forms of economic cooperation. We argue that economic diversity is more responsive than big business to the needs of diverse human populations.\u201d \n\n\n\nProposed amendment of the current language: Greens seek to build an alternative economic system based on ecology and decentralization of power, an alternative system that rejects both the capitalist system that maintains private ownership over almost all production as well as the old narrative of state socialism that assumes control over industries without democratic, local decision making. We believe the old models of capitalism (private ownership of production) and state socialism (state ownership of production) are not ecologically sound, socially just, or democratic and that both contain built\u00adin structures that advance injustices. Instead Greens will build an economy based on large\u00adscale public works, municipalization, and workplace and community democracy. Some call this small\u00adscale, decentralized system \u201cecological socialism,\u201d \u201ccommunalism,\u201d or the \u201ccooperative commonwealth,\u201d but whatever the terminology, Greens believe it will help end labor exploitation, environmental exploitation, and racial, gender, and wealth inequality and bring about economic and social justice. Production should be democratically owned and operated by those who do the work and those most affected by production decisions. This model of worker and community control will ensure that decisions that greatly affect our lives are made in the interests of our communities, not at the whim of centralized power structures of state administrators or of capitalist CEOs and distant boards of directors. Worker\u00adowned production, embedded in and accountable to our communities, provides an incentive for enterprises to make ecologically sound decisions in materials sourcing, waste disposal, recycling, reuse, and more. Democratic ownership of the means of production would decentralize power in the workplace, which would in turn decentralize economic power more broadly. \n\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION / TIMELINE / RESOURCES: Approval of this proposal will amend the 2016 Platform, which will be published on the GPUS website in or before September, 2016. \n\n\n\nREFERENCES: In addition to having been edited and/or reviewed and endorsed by Gloria Mattera (GPNY), David Cobb (GPCA), Ben Manski (GPWI), and others, this platform amendment has also been reviewed and endorsed by these individuals: Gar Alperovitz , Green Shadow Cabinet; the Next System Project Richard D.

Click here for the most recent interview before this one.\n\nBlack Lives Matter and Democratic Socialists of America activist khalid kamau is running for city council in South Fulton, Georgia. (Photo courtesy of khalid kamau)Today we bring you a conversation with khalid kamau, a member of Black Lives Matter Atlanta, Our Revolution and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) who is running for city council in South Fulton, Georgia.\n\nSarah Jaffe: Let's start with your decision to run for the city council. Talk about what made you decide to run for elected office.\n\nkhalid kamau: There were a variety of factors, but it all really began with Bernie Sanders. I don't think any of us yet recognized how monumental his campaign was. Every presidential race brings into the political process a new generation of volunteers, people who are willing to knock doors and get involved in politics, but Bernie galvanized a group of highly educated, highly skilled activists. These people were pretty much already politically involved, folks like myself. Then, he charged us to run for local office, specifically, as a way of both infiltrating and transforming the Democratic Party, and working our way up the political ladder.\n\nI think one of the big mistakes that many folks on the left, particularly, make -- but people in general -- is this idea of trying to transform government and society from the top down. So, only focus on the big races; the presidential race or governor's race. We hope to get someone in office that way and that they will make this change from the top down. What we have seen, obviously, from states like North Carolina is that even when you are able to win the big seats, which are usually long-shot races, if you haven't infiltrated that party or that government structure from the ground up, it is very hard for a head of state, whether it is a governor or the president to really institute change if they don't have a cooperative Congress or state legislature or city council.\n\nThen, the second important thing about going the other direction is that you are really developing a set of people that vote in key positions. For example, both with the nomination process for the Democratic Party and the elections this last month of the DNC [Democratic National Committee] chairs, there weren't enough progressives in decision-making places, be it superdelegates or delegates to the convention, but also post holders and county chairs that get to vote at the DNC winter meeting for the DNC Chair. Those positions are held by people that get into them years before those elections happen. So, years before the 2016 convention and years before the 2017 DNC winter meeting, people ran for elections and got into those seats. It is really important that we do the really hard, long-game groundwork. Those are the things that excited me, personally, as an activist and political organizer.\n\nI was thinking about how I could get involved in Metro Atlanta, in my local area. By the grace of God, it turned out that the area that I lived in, which was unincorporated, decided to become a city. So, here, this place that I was currently living, which is where I was born and raised -- I live in the house that I grew up in as a child -- was incorporating and becoming a city. That was a natural fit. Then, I learned the specifics, that this city will be the largest city that the State of Georgia has created in over a hundred years and that it is nearly the size of the capital city itself.... Every day people are beginning to realize just how large this city is, how many different counties and municipalities we will touch. We have the possibility to have the largest progressive city in the South if we can win four out of the seven city council positions and/or the mayor's office.\n\nThe third key point is that by having a city that is progressive, it gives us a chance to make the argument for progressive policy. A lot of these policies that Bernie and other progressives have talked about, whether it is a $15 minimum wage and universal health care or having Election Day be a national holiday -- lots of people think, \"Oh, those are good ideas, but they can't work. They are not sustainable. They are not economically feasible.\" So, we are asking people very often in national elections to take a chance on something that they have not seen at the local level, on a smaller level. This is our shot, in Georgia specifically, but in the South in general, to show that these policies actually do work and that they are not just good ideas, but they are smart ideas and they can grow economies and transform regions and get people involved in their electorate and their local government. Those are things that excite me.\n\nI understand you work with a variety of organizations and activist groups in the Atlanta area. I would love to hear about some of the organizing you did with Black Lives Matter and the Fight for $15.\n\nI helped organize the Atlanta chapter of Black Lives Matter. I was at the very first meeting. It was actually called by a very forward-thinking comrade, Mary Hooks. She called together a meeting, so I got involved with that. We had done a lot, particularly around addressing police violence. I call it Blue on Black Crime here in Atlanta. That is actually another thing that inspired me to run ... there have been quite a few incidents in Georgia. We have been trying to at least have a trial for police officers. We have not in the past seven years -- there have been over 70 shootings, 70 killings of civilians by police and we have not once in those seven years ever had a trial, let alone a conviction, just never even a trial about it.\n\nWe have been really pushing as well for marijuana decriminalization because that is a big driver in the prison pipeline. Georgia is actually [at the top] for disparate marijuana arrests. For Black and Brown people being arrested at a disproportionate rate. Those are the two big things we have been working on.\n\nI realize with this new city, that a lot of the positions that we were trying to replace or a lot of the ordinances that we were trying to have changed, as a brand new city, we would get to write those ordinances. We would get to select or vote on the police chief or the city court system. It just seems like a natural progression.\n\nI also worked with organized labor here in Atlanta both for the Fight for $15, but also in my own job. At the time that I began working for the Sanders campaign, I was actually a paratransit bus operator here in Atlanta. Atlanta transit system, which is called MARTA, Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, decided to outsource over three 300 bus operators and mechanics. It was really an effort to get out of its contract with the union, to get out of its pension obligations and its health insurance obligations that had been negotiated by organized labor. We fought that for several months. The outsourcing happened, and I lost my job, which really further radicalized me.\n\nThe good news is that a federal judge has actually overturned that outsourcing and issued an injunction. Those transit workers are going to get their jobs back. MARTA is still appealing that decision, but as of right now it looks like the court has ruled in our favor, so those jobs will go back. Just being a part of those different movements was really what helped when it came time for me to run for office in terms of endorsements and volunteers. It was really just sort of a natural evolution.\n\nGeorgia is not a state with a big labor movement -- it is a so-called \"right to work\" state. I would love to hear you talk a little bit more about being involved in the labor movement in Georgia, in Atlanta -- the pitfalls, but also the positives of the labor movement in Georgia.\n\nWith the current administration that we have in office and the balance of the Supreme Court right now, we may be nationally moving to a national right-to-work law and overturning decades of precedents that favored organized labor. I think it is sort of exciting and informative to be in this state to see how labor organizes and recruits when it is not automatic for workers to be enrolled. How do you, in a right-to-work state, explain the value and importance of joining the union and supporting the union? My work, primarily, has been with ATU, the transit union. But, I was also a member of CWA and I have been endorsed in this race by the Teamsters.\n\nI found out about your campaign through the Democratic Socialists of America, who were very excited to have one of their own running for office. I would love to hear you talk a little bit about the connections that you have to national groups, and thinking about running for local office in the context of building a broader movement across the country.\n\nI think it is very important. We only have a two-party system, unfortunately, right now. So, in states where Democrats are not in power (red states), it is very important to network nationally so that you can get a level of support both financially and in terms of volunteers that your party locally may not be able to supply. I don't think that we have a shortage of volunteers in Georgia, but it has been amazing, the groundswell of financial support that I have gotten nationally just being aligned with Our Revolution and Bernie Sanders and by the Democratic Socialists of America, which Bernie also came out of. I travelled to New York to speak at the youth conference, signed up scores of volunteers, received thousands upon thousands of dollars, at this point, tens of thousands of dollars in donations from across the country.\n\nThat is very key in financing these insurgent campaigns because even if you are able to garner support from your local state party -- which, very often, you will not because they have their own establishment candidates that they prefer to support -- it is very important for true progressives to network across state lines and to pool their resources across state lines into races that we can both win and that can have some notable impact on policy for a region.\n\nRelated to that, what has been the reaction of the establishment Democrats to your campaign? How have they reacted to you? Especially, after your pretty overwhelming vote total in the first round of this election.\n\nThey have been quietly supportive. There is always a complicated political calculus. In my race, it was really historic. We have seven city council districts and a mayor. So, eight seats and we had over 71 candidates for those eight seats. Many establishment Democrats in Georgia were afraid to endorse me or anyone in any of the races, because they were afraid of who they might piss off that was connected to one of the 71 candidates. All of us know our different people. So, a lot of them just stayed out of the race. Then, very often -- and it is probably a good thing -- many state parties and state party leaders, because this is an overwhelmingly Democratic race and region, many of them have a policy of just not getting into races where there is a Democrat on Democrat.\n\nSo, their support has been tepid, at best. But, having true progressives, unapologetic progressives, I really see us building a movement that is sort of like the Tea Party where we are not afraid to endorse in intra-partisan races or non-partisan races. People like the DSA or Our Revolution are looking for bona fide progressive candidates. Those are the only people they are going to support and they will support them even if they are running against another Democrat and they put money behind it. Then, you do have a few courageous establishment Democrats like Ted Terry, who is the Mayor of Clarkston, who is really a model for progressivism in Georgia. He has raised the minimum wage of city workers to $15 an hour and made voting a municipal holiday and also lessened the penalties for marijuana so that working-class people are not just being locked up for smoking a joint.\n\nThat is also the importance of having true progressives get organized in a fundraising way and in a volunteer way to really influence local elections. Hopefully, this is just practice for first a state-wide movement to get involved in politics at the state level and then, the national level. I think this campaign has been galvanizing for progressives because they understand, \"Oh, when we get involved and we start organizing in a very targeted way and supporting people [in] a very targeted way, we can win races and if we can do this locally, we can do it on larger stages, as well.\"\n\nI think the thing that is most powerful about this race, or even my campaign, is that I love Bernie, but I think where his campaign failed -- I don't think this is a personal failure of Bernie, but perhaps of the people that were around him and advising that campaign -- is that there wasn't enough attention paid to people of color. I am not sure that people of color who were in that campaign were listened to the way they should have been. Bernie didn't make -- he made a very excellent class argument. I think it is implied that people of color are more disproportionately affected by class disparities than whites. I think there was an assumption that people of color would understand that and would understand that the arguments that he was making about class and equality were implicitly also arguments about racial inequality.\n\nI think that, frankly, because Bernie was an old white man, Black folks, people of color, did not implicitly get that he was speaking to them. I did think he was speaking to them, but I am not sure everyone else did. One of the things that the progressive movement is going to have to do is find leaders of color and candidates of color to carry this message. When I speak about it, rightly or wrongly, when I am talking about income equality and when I am talking about working-class families, the Black and Brown audiences that I speak to do implicitly get that I am speaking to them and that I am speaking for them and that I am speaking about them. I don't necessarily go around making a lot of racial arguments. I think that my bona fides of Black Lives Matter speak volumes about my own racial politics and that I can make these arguments of class [that] people of color get, because this city is 89 percent African American and because I am African American, people know that I am talking about them.\n\nThe best way to reach out to communities of color is by having candidates of color and instituting these policies in cities of color. If you look at a lot of these most progressive places, they are places like Seattle or Massachusetts. In a lot of these most progressive cities, they tend to be smaller cities, they tend to be more white and more affluent. The idea is that only rich people, only rich white folks can afford to enact these kinds of progressive policies. I think it is going to be really important that the leadership of the Democratic Party specifically but [of] the left in general ... needs to look like its base of voters.\n\nI know that there has been all of this angst about \"How do we get working-class white voters?\" But, right now, the most consistent voters in America are Black women and the most consistently progressive voters are Black and Brown folks. We need to grow the base of our party or of that movement with those folks and make sure that we are running candidates in places and instituting policies in places that support those folks. I do think that the big issue of these next few elections, and I think the next 20 years [in] America, the biggest challenge that we will face is income inequality and this growing disparity. The middle class has disappeared. Now we have a working class and wealthy class. We really need to keep hammering that truth into the public and political conversation that is happening. That is what I hope to do, is to bridge that racial gap for people to understand that ... we are all suffering from income inequality for the past 30 years.\n\nWhat are the next steps here? When is the runoff?\n\nThe runoff is April 18. Early voting has already begun. It will be going on for three weeks through the Friday before April 18. Then, on April 18, that Tuesday will be our election. In addition to my race, when folks get in touch with me, they can find out about people that I am endorsing across other city council districts. Once again, it is about being effective in implementing these policy changes. That is not something I can do unilaterally. I will need a vote of four and, hopefully, a progressively disposed mayor to make these changes happen.\n\nHow can people keep up with you?\n\nThey can get in touch with me at khalidcares.com.

It's broken. It was probably always broken, but it's worse than ever.\"\n\nMy conversation with Peter Sunde, one of the founders and spokespersons of The Pirate Bay, did not start out optimistically. There's good reason for that: In the last couple of months, the contemporary download culture shows heavy signs of defeat in the battle for the internet.\n\nLast month we saw Demonii disappear. It was the biggest torrent tracker on the internet, responsible for over 50 million trackers a year. Additionally, the MPAA took down YIFY and Popcorn Time. Then news got out that the Dutch Release Team, an uploading collective, made a legal settlement with anti-piracy group BREIN.\n\nWhile it might look like torrenters are are still fighting this battle, Sunde claims that the reality is more definitive: \"We have already lost.\"\n\nBack in 2003 Peter Sunde, together with Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm, started The Pirate Bay, a website that would become the biggest and most famous file-sharing website in the world. In 2009, the three founders were convicted of \"assisting [others] in copyright infringement\" in a highly controversial trial.\n\n\"Stop treating internet like it's a different thing and start focusing on what you actually want your society to look like.\"\n\n\n\nSunde was incarcerated in 2014 and released a year later. After his time in jail he started blogging about the centralization of power by the European Union; ran as a candidate for the Finnish Pirate Party during the elections to the European Parliament; and founded Flattr, a micro donation system for software developers.\n\nI wanted to speak with Sunde about the current state of the free and open internet, but this conversation quickly changed into an ideological exchange about society and capitalism\u2014which is, according to Sunde, the real problem.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nMOTHERBOARD: Hey Peter, I was planning on asking you if things are going well, but you made it pretty clear that that isn't the case.\n\nPeter Sunde: No, I don't see any good happening. People are too easy to content with things.\n\nTake the net neutrality law in Europe. It's terrible, but people are happy and go like \"it could be worse.\" That is absolutely not the right attitude. Facebook brings the internet to Africa and poor countries, but they're only giving limited access to their own services and make money off of poor people. And getting government grants to do that, because they do PR well.\n\nFinland actually made internet access a human right a while back. That was a clever thing of Finland. But that's like the only positive thing I have seen in any country anywhere in the world regarding the internet\n\nSo, how bad is the state of the open internet?\n\nWell, we don't have an open internet. We haven't had an open internet for a long time. So, we can't really talk about the open internet because it does not exist anymore. The problem is, nobody stops anything. We are losing privileges and rights all of the time. We are not gaining anything anywhere. The trend is just going in one direction: a more closed and more controlled internet. That has a big impact on our society. Because they are the same thing today. If you have a more oppressed internet, you have a more oppressed society. So that's something we should focus on.\n\nBut still we think of the internet like this new kind Wild West place, and things are not in chains yet, so we don't care because everything will be OK anyhow. But that is not really the case. We have never seen this amount of centralization, extreme inequality, extreme capitalism in any system before. But according to the marketing done by people like Mark Zuckerberg and companies like Google, it's all to help with the open network and to spread democracy, and so on. At the same time, they are capitalistic monopolies. So it's like trusting the enemy to do the good deeds. It is really bizarre.\n\nDo you think because a lot of people don't consider the internet to be real or a real place, they care less about its well-being?\n\nWell, one thing is, we have been growing up with an understanding of the importance of things like a telephone line or television. So if we would start to treat our telephone lines or TV channels like we treat the internet, people would get really upset. If someone would tell you, you can't call a friend, you would understand then that this is a very bad thing that is happening. You understand your rights. But people don't have that with the internet. If someone would tell you, you can't use Skype for that and that, you don't get the feeling it's about you personally. Just by being a virtual thing, it's suddenly not directed at you. You don't see someone spying on you, you don't see something censored, you don't see it when someone deletes stuff out of the search results out of Google. I think that's the biggest problem to get people's attention. You don't see the problems, so people don't feel connected to it.\n\nI would rather not care about it myself. Because it's very hard to do something about it, and not become a paranoid conspiracy person. And you don't want to be that. So rather just give up. That's kind of what people have been thinking, I think.\n\nWhat is it exactly that you have given up?\n\nWell, I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet.\n\nThe situation is not going to be any different, because apparently that is something people are not interested in fixing. Or we can't get people to care enough. Maybe it's a mixture, but this is kind of the situation we are in, so its useless to do anything about it.\n\nWe have become somehow the Black Knight from Monty Python's Holy Grail. We have maybe half of our head left and we are still fighting, we still think we have a chance of winning this battle.\n\nSo what can people do to change this?\n\nNo, I think we are at that point. I think it's really important people understand this. We lost this fight. Just admit defeat and make sure next time you understand why you lost this fight and make sure it doesn't happen again when we try and win the war.\n\nRight, so what is this war about and what should we do to win it?\n\nWell, I think, to win the war, we first of need to understand what the fight is and for me it's clear that we are dealing with ideological thing: extreme capitalism that's ruling, extreme lobbying that's ruling and the centralization of power. The internet is just a part of a bigger puzzle.\n\nAnd the other thing with activism is that you have to get momentum and attention and such. We have been really bad at that. So we stopped ACTA, but then it just came back with a different name. By that time, we had used all our resources and public attention on that.\n\nThe reason that the real world is the big target for me, is because the internet is emulating the real world. We are trying to recreate this capitalistic society we have on top of the internet. So the internet has been mostly fuel on the capitalistic fire, by kind of pretending to be something which will connect the whole world, but actually having a capitalistic agenda.\n\nLook at all the biggest companies in the world, they are all based on the internet. Look at what they are selling: nothing. Facebook has no product. Airbnb, the biggest hotel chain in the world, has no hotels. Uber, the biggest taxi company in the world, has no taxis whatsoever.\n\n\"I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet.\"\n\n\n\nThe amount of employees in these companies are smaller than ever before and the profits are, in turn, larger. Apple and Google are passing oil companies by far. Minecraft got sold for $2.6 billion and WhatsApp for like $19 billion. These are insane amounts of money for nothing. That is why the internet and capitalism are so in love with each other.\n\nYou told me the internet is broken, that it was always broken. What do you mean by that and do we have extreme capitalism to blame for it?\n\nWell, the thing is the internet is really stupid. It works really simply in a simple manner and it doesn't take any adjustments for censorship. Like, if one cable is gone, you take the traffic through some other place. But thanks to the centralization of the internet, (possible) censorship or surveillance tech is a whole lot harder to get around. Also, because the internet was an American invention, they also still have control of it and ICANN can actually force any country top level domain to be censored or disconnected. For me that's, a really broken design.\n\nBut it has always been broken, we just never really cared about it, because there always have been a few good people that made sure that nothing bad happened before. But I think that's the wrong idea. Rather let bad thing happen as quick as possible so we can fix them and make sure it does not happen in the future. We are prolonging this inevitable total failure, which is not helping us at all.\n\nSo, we should just let it crash and burn down, pick up the pieces and start over?\n\nYes, with the focus on the big war on this extreme capitalism. I couldn't vote, but I was hoping Sarah Palin won last time in the US elections. I'm hoping Donald Trump wins this year's election. For the reason that it will fuck up that country so much faster then if a less bad President wins. Our whole world is just so focused on money, money, money. That's the biggest problem. That's why everything fucks up. That's the target we have to fix. We need to make sure that we are going to get a different focus in life.\n\n\"We don't have an open internet. We haven't had an open internet for a long time.\"\n\n\n\nHopefully technology will give us robots that will take away all the jobs, which will cause like a massive worldwide unemployment; somewhat like 60 percent. People will be so unhappy. That would be great, because then you can finally see capitalism crashing so hard. There is going to be a lot of fear, lost blood, and lost lives to get to that point, but I think that's the only positive thing I see, that we are going to have a total system collapse in the future. Hopefully as quick as possible. I would rather be 50 then be like 85 when the system is crashing.\n\nThis all sounds quite like some sort of Marxist revolution: a total crash of the capitalist system.\n\nWell, yeah, I totally agree with that. I'm a socialist. I know Marx and communism did not work before, but I think in the future you have the possibility of having total communism and equal access to everything for everybody. Most people I meet, no matter if they are a communist or a capitalist, agree with me on this, because they understand the potential.\n\nSo, is there like a concrete thing we should focus on? Or do we need to aim for a new way of thinking? A new ideology?\n\nWell, I think the focus needs to be that the internet is exactly the same as society. People might realize that it's not a really good idea to have all of our data and files on Google, Facebook and company servers. All of these things need to be communicated al the way to the political top, of course. But stop treating internet like it's a different thing and start focusing on what you actually want your society to look like. We have to fix society, before we can fix the internet. That's the only thing."}, "http://www.harrietfraad.com/writings/the-feminist-movement-what-happened-and-why.html": {"title": "harrietfraad - Writings - The Feminist Movement - What Happened and Why?", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.harrietfraad.com/writings/the-feminist-movement-what-happened-and-why.html", "text": "By Harriet Fraad | Blog | First Published on Tikkun Daily\n\nThere is much media attention on the 50 year Anniversary of Betty Friedan\u2019s book, The Feminine Mystique published in 1963. Friedan\u2019s book is touted as the beginning of the \u201cFeminist Movement.\u201d However in the 1960s when second wave feminism was born there were two branches of Feminism. One, has been repressed. The other celebrated. One was Friedan\u2019s and later Gloria Steinem\u2019s. It was a gender only movement fighting for gender equality within the United States as it was, with its racial and class hierarchy. It was dominated by privileged educated women. The other branch of the women\u2019s movement was the class conscious \u201cWomen\u2019s Liberation Movement\u201d which emerged from the radical Anti- War and Civil Rights movements.\n\nThe original Women\u2019s Liberation Movement was a movement of both race and class integration, a vision of justice for all. It saw female liberation as the basis for social revolution. In fact, an article called \u201cFemale Liberation as the Basis for Social Revolution\u201d appeared in one of the earliest publications of The Women\u2019s Liberation Movement, \u201cNotes From the Second Year,\u201d issued by its founding group \u201cRed Stockings\u201d in 1970. Other statements of that period stressing the unity of race, class and gender oppression were issued by The Third World Women\u2019s Alliance in 1969, and The Third World Gay Revolution (1969). These original documents are reprinted in Dear Sisters: Dispatches From The Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (Baxandall & Gordon, Eds. 2000). Friedan was the president and a founder of NOW, the National Organization of Women which works for legislative reform. She also helped to found NARAL, the National Abortion Rights Action League. Both groups demand legislation, lobby legislatures and endorse candidates. They stress particular projects to integrate women into an America which is increasingly stratified into a privileged 1% minority and a suffering 99% majority, in which the poorest people are single women of color with children. Women\u2019s Liberation was a movement rather than a list of projects. It captured the lives of millions of women who mobilized in direct actions for child care, the end to sexism in and outside of the home. The original movement embraced race, class and gender.\n\nOne thing that happened was the enormous funding that the CIA allocated to its operative, Gloria Steinem. Although it is not discussed on US television, the net is replete with information about Steinem\u2019s CIA employment from her days as a student informing on US students attending world youth festivals, to her gender only subversion of the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement:\n\nWhat Gloria Steinem, Henry Kissinger Have In Common: CIA Pay\n\nGloria Steinem discussing her time in the CIA\n\nThe Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America\n\nAs a founding mother of the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement which was as enthusiastic as it was naive, none of us imagined the influence of the CIA on our movement. Through CIA subversion led by Steinem, and our naivete, the movement became a largely gender essentialist, set of projects within the capitalist system. It became an attempt to create equality for women with a system of ever greater economic and social inequality. These days people would be far more astute than we were."}, "http://www.redspark.nu/en/peoples-war/india/150-million-indian-workers-will-strike-tomorrow-against-modis-anti-labor-policies/": {"title": "150 million Indian workers will strike tomorrow against Modi\u2019s anti-labor policies \u2013 Redspark", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.redspark.nu/en/peoples-war/india/150-million-indian-workers-will-strike-tomorrow-against-modis-anti-labor-policies/", "text": "September 2, 2016 will see one of the largest coordinated labour strikes ever in India, possibly in the world.

By 8:24, Maddow was tweeting that the tax return in question was Donald Trump\u2019s 1040 from 2005. By 8:30, still half an hour before Maddow started airing, the White House had responded to the MSNBC report, saying that Trump had paid $38 million on income of $150 million that year. An hour later, about 20 minutes after The Rachel Maddow Show started, Maddow would confirm these numbers, turning her big scoop about Donald Trump\u2019s long-missing tax returns into a cautionary tale about overhype. Rachel Maddow, you played yourself\u2014and us too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit of a hullabaloo around here this evening, I apologize for being flustered,\u201d Maddow said at the top of the hour, before confirming that her show had copies of Donald Trump\u2019s federal tax returns, obtained by the reporter David Cay Johnston, to share with her audience. \u201cIn just a second we\u2019re going to show you exactly what it is we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said, before launching, instead, into a 20-minute monologue. Maddow seemed uncharacteristically nervous as she wended her way though what could kindly be described as context and which I am unkindly describing as word salad, a long meander that was difficult to follow even without the distracting promise of a revelatory tax return at its end.\n\nThe monologue started contextually enough, with a long-winded skewering of Trump\u2019s refusal to share his tax returns that touched on Richard Nixon, the Clintons, and his unaudited tax forms, before veering off conspiratorially. \u201cWhether or not you are a supporter of Donald Trump,\u201d Maddow said, \u201cIt ought to give you pause that his explanations [for not releasing his tax returns] have never made any factual sense. \u2026 When you get an excuse from them that doesn't make sense, you have to look for another reason. What\u2019s the real explanation? Well, choose your own adventure.\u201d She then launched into a long hypothetical about a particular Russian oligarch\u2019s possible relationship to Trump that touched on Florida real estate, Deutsche Bank, and Preet Bharara that Trump\u2019s tax returns\u2014though not, as it would turn out, the ones she actually had\u2014could conceivably clear up.\n\nThe longer Maddow went on, ever deeper into a conspiratorial thicket, the clearer it became that whatever tax returns Maddow had, they weren\u2019t as juicy as the ones she was talking about. If she had anything that damning, she would have shared them from the start. TV is a ratings game, but an entire episode about highly damaging tax returns is just as likely to get you great ratings as milking the possibility that you have highly damaging tax returns and less likely to get you compared to Geraldo. Maddow even went so far as to hold the tax returns back until after the first commercial break, as if we were watching an episode of The Bachelor and not a matter of national importance\u2014because we weren\u2019t, in fact, watching a matter of national importance, just a cable news show trying to set a ratings record.\n\nAfter the first break\u2014at which point the tax returns were already available on the internet and glossed by the Daily Beast\u2014Maddow was joined by Johnston, and she began by asking him how he knew Trump hadn\u2019t sent the returns himself. Johnston said that he could have. A few hours after Maddow finished airing, this has become a popular conspiracy theory, simply because, if Donald Trump were to share any of his tax returns, the 2005 1040 seems like a good candidate. Trump paid taxes at a rate of around 4 percent, but because of the alternate minimum tax, he also paid an additional $31 million. The form revealed that, rather than not paying taxes and making no money, Trump paid $38 million on $150 million in income. Maddow promised to pull a sordid revelation out of a hat and instead plucked out \u2026 Trump\u2019s credibility? Maddow was soon parsing, asking Johnston to explain that Trump is currently trying to do away with the AMT, which, unfair as it may be, still wouldn\u2019t change the amount he paid in 2005.\n\nAs the show went on, it became clear that Maddow knew she didn't quite have the scoop that had been promised. \u201cWhat would we have to see, what would we hope to get in mail,\u201d she asked Johnston, \u201cif we were going to get to the real meat of Donald Trump\u2019s foreign ties?\u201d\u2014i.e., what would be more meaningful than the tax form that we have? Speaking to Chris Hayes and Johnston, she said, \u201cThe story here to me is, a) we have obtained this [tax form], b) that this stuff is obtainable.\u201d \u201cBREAKING: Trump\u2019s tax returns theoretically obtainable. Tonight, 9 p.m. ET. MSNBC. (Seriously)\u201d does make for a less rousing tweet.\n\nTrump\u2019s tax returns, whatever information they happen to contain, constitute a major scoop. Maddow\u2019s social media team ensured the highest possible ratings for that scoop. But if ever a story should have been delivered in a stentorian, fuddy-duddy, nonpartisan manner, this was it. In positioning it as a grand revelation, a vital step in comprehending Trump\u2019s corruption, MSNBC created an exceedingly cynical spectacle. By playing into the network\u2019s loyal liberal audience\u2019s fantasy that there exists a Trump silver bullet, it instead delivered Trump a positive news cycle\u2014the guy pays taxes! Who knew!\u2014amidst the debacle of the American Health Care Act, along with more evidence that the media is aligned against him. The lesson?

Not for nothing is it called the forgotten war.\n\nThe result was perhaps three million dead and, the museum recalls, the first US armistice in history signed without a victory. In three years of fighting a single major city changed hands: Kaesong, which is now the last vestige of a once hopeful d\u00e9tente with the South.\n\nAir Force general Curtis LeMay, head of the strategic air command during the Korean War, estimated that the American campaign killed 20 per cent of the population. \u201cWe went over there and fought the war and eventually burned down every town in North Korea,\u201d he said.\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur\u2019s plan to win was a list of targets sent to the Pentagon, requesting 34 atomic bombs to create \u201ca belt of radioactive cobalt across the neck of Manchuria so that there could be no land invasion of Korea from the north for at least 60 years\u201d.\n\nOut of the wreckage of that conflict \u2013 unresolved to this day \u2013 founder Kim Il-sung built his isolated state, squeezed to the north by an old enemy, China, and a new one, the American-backed South. Instead of nursery rhymes, schoolchildren were taught songs about the \u201cAmerican imperialist bastards\u201d and their \u201clackeys\u201d in Seoul and Tokyo.\n\nIncursions by American spy ships and planes, and huge annual drills by the Americans and South Koreans that still practise invading the North and decapitating its leadership, have worsened the deep official paranoia.\n\nThis is the country that US president Donald Trump threatened to wreck in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly. \u201cThe United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\u201d\n\nNot known for his deep reading of history, Trump may be unaware that the United States has in fact destroyed North Korea before. And with \u201cnext to no concern for civilian casualties, says Bruce Cumings in his book The Korean War: A History.\n\nThis amnesia is surely helping to fuel the current build up of tensions. A Gallup poll last week found that 58 per cent of Americans would support military action against North Korea if peaceful and diplomatic means fail.\n\nWhere the Americans have forgotten, however, the North Koreans are trained to remember.\n\nNorth Korean high schools must set aside two rooms for the study of the lives of Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il: The Benevolent Sun and the Dear Leader \u2013 revered grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong-un - who defeated the \u201cimperialists\u201d.\n\nSchoolchildren spend a sixth of their day in these rooms, surrounded by portraits and episodes from the struggle against the Americans and Japanese. Anecdotes from Kim Jong-il\u2019s life recall the biblical tales of Jesus Christ as he walked among the people.\n\nAll this rarely gets a hearing in America. As Cumings recently noted: \u201cAll of our media appear to live in an eternal present, with each new crisis treated as sui generis.\u201d But, he warns, \u201cwe forget at our peril\u201d that bellicose threats against the North did not start this week."}, "https://youthandeldersja.wordpress.com/2015/03/12/unicef-cuba-has-0-child-malnutrition/": {"title": "UNICEF: Cuba has 0% Child Malnutrition", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://youthandeldersja.wordpress.com/2015/03/12/unicef-cuba-has-0-child-malnutrition/", "text": "The existence in the developing world of 146 million children under five years old who are underweight, contrasts with the reality of Cuban children, recognized worldwide for being outside the social evil.\n\nThese alarming figures appeared in a recent report from the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF), entitled Progress for Children, A Report Card on Nutrition,, released at the UN headquarters.\n\nAccording to the document, the percentage of underweight children in different region of the world are: 28 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, 17 in the Middle East and North Africa, 15 in East Asia and the Pacific, seven in Latin America and the Caribbean.The table is completed by Central and Eastern Europe, with five percent, and other developing countries, with 27 percent.\n\nCuba has no such problem\n\nCuba has no such problems, it is the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean that has eliminated severe child malnutrition, thanks to government efforts to improve the nutrition of people, especially those most vulnerable.\n\nFive million children die each year of hunger\n\nThe harsh realities of the world show that 852 million people go hungry \u2013 53 million live in Latin America. In Mexico alone there are five million 200 thousand undernourished and in Haiti three million 800 thousand, while worldwide over five million children die each year of hunger.\n\nAccording to United Nations estimates, it would be very costly to achieve basic health and nutrition for everyone in the Third World.

Especially, a constant watch on the livelihoods of children, girls and adolescents is maintained. Thus, attention to nutrition begins with the promotion of better and natural way to feed humans.\n\nUN campaign against malnutrition in 2015\n\nThe issue of malnutrition looms large in the UN campaign in 2015 to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, adopted at the Summit of Heads of State and Government held in 2000, and whose goals include eliminating extreme poverty and hunger by that date.\n\nDespite shortcomings, difficulties and serious limitations for economic, commercial and financial activities imposed by the United States embargo for more than five decades, Cuba does not show desperate nor alarming rates of child malnutrition.

And they got us blocked in from the other side. Are they shooting?\u201d\n\nHis fear of tear gas is appropriate. Despite its ubiquity across the globe and in United States, tear gas is a chemical agent banned in warfare per the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, which set forth agreements signed by nearly every nation in the world \u2014 including the United States. The catch, however, is that while it\u2019s illegal in war, it\u2019s legal in domestic riot control. That means Turkey got to use it on its protesters last year. That meant Bahrain got to the do the same. And now, in Ferguson, cops are likewise blasting residents protesting the police for the killing of an unarmed teen named Michael Brown.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to get to my sister\u2019s house,\u201d one 23-year-old sobbed on his lawn, according to this harrowing report by The Washington Post\u2019s Wesley Lowery, who was arrested by police Wednesday. The man said police had pelted him with rubber bullets and sprayed his face with tear gas.\n\nFerguson police chief Tom Jackson has defended the use of tear gas. \u201cThere are complaints about the response from some people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to me, nobody got hurt seriously, and I\u2019m happy about that.\u201d\n\nWhile that appears to have held true as of Thursday morning, some scientists and international observers contend the tactic of spraying people with tear gas, which commonly uses the chemical agent 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS), can pose serious dangers. \u201cTear gas under the Geneva Convention is characterized as a chemical warfare agent, and so it is precluded for use in warfare, but it is used very frequently against civilians,\u201d Sven-Eric Jordt, a nerve gas expert at Yale University School of Medicine, explained to National Geographic. \u201cThat\u2019s very illogical.\u201d\n\nTechnically not a gas, Jordt said, tear gas is an aerosol. \u201cTear gases are nerve gases that specifically activate pain-sensing nerves,\u201d Jordt told National Geographic. And when used properly, in lower doses and deployed in open spaces, its effects are more or less harmless. Those affected sneeze and cough and panic \u2014 and may even temporarily go blind \u2014 but those symptoms subside after several hours. A 2003 study found there \u201cis no evidence that a healthy individual will experience long-term health effects from open-air exposures to CS or CR, although contamination with CR is less easy to remove.\u201d\n\nBut sometimes things don\u2019t go as planned. \u201cThe use of tear gas in \u2026 situations of civil unrest, however, demonstrates that exposure to the weapon is difficult to control and indiscriminate, and the weapon is often not used correctly,\u201d wrote Howard Hu in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1989. \u201cSevere traumatic injury from exploding tear gas bombs as well as lethal toxic injury have been documented.\u201d Hu found that if exposed to \u201chigh levels of CS,\u201d some victims experienced heart failure or even death. \u201cAn infant exposed to CS in a house into which police had fired CS canisters to subdue a mentally disturbed adult developed severe pneumonitis requiring therapy with steroids, oxygen, antibiotics, and 29 days of hospitalization.\u201d\n\nThe levels of toxicity of the gas that most police departments deploy in the United States is lower than what\u2019s found in places like the Middle East, according to Yale researcher Jordt, though some domestic uses have stirred controversy. On April 19, 1993, the FBI sprayed tear gas into a large compound in Waco, Tex., that housed a religious sect called the Branch Davidians. A fire eventually consumed the center and more than 75 people, including 28 children, died. Investigators wrote in a subsequent report that if the victims hadn\u2019t been able to leave the compound, \u201cthere is a distinct possibility that this kind of CS exposure can significantly contribute to or even cause lethal effects.\u201d\n\nMore recently, in 2011, a Palestinian man named Mustafa Tamimi was killed when a tear gas canister hit him in the head at close range, according to Amnesty International. Later that year, another Palestinian died of inhaling tear gas. Earlier this year, in April, one Palestinian woman died of tear gas inhalation, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nIn Egypt, policemen shot tear gas into the back of a vehicle carrying supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi to prison, asphyxiating and killing 37 inside. \u201cOf all the ways to die,\u201d Foreign Policy reported, \u201cthis was one of the most horrible.\u201d The men\u2019s lawyer would later say that the men\u2019s faces were so distorted and blue that most thought they had been burned.\n\nBurning is a common feeling when tear gas hits. It\u2019s a refrain victims return to from Egypt to Gaza, from Istanbul to Ferguson.\n\nThat, and the suddenness of it. How quickly the gas chokes.\n\n\u201cThese m\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 came out of the cut and sprayed me in the face like this is a f\u2014\u2014 video game or something,\u201d one Ferguson man told The Post.

The documentary features dramatic battle scene recreations accompanied by Hollywood blockbuster music, in which a Nazi-linked group known as the Forest Brothers ambushes and kills Soviet officers.\n\nThis is the story of the Forest Brothers who fought the Soviet army for their homelands after WWII pic.twitter.com/4JcfuJPmeO\n\nThe film includes interviews with former partisan fighters and their supporters, and even highlights modern-day Lithuanian Special Forces, depicting them as heroes on the frontlines against Russia.\n\n\u201cThe legacy of a struggle by a small force against overwhelming odds lives on today in the Special Forces units of all three countries,\u201d the narrator declares. A Lithuanian Special Forces officer adds, \u201cAll our history derives from the Forest Brothers.\u201d\n\nThe eight-minute movie does not once mention that many of the members of the Forest Brothers previously fought on behalf of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. The anti-communist partisans were largely former members of the Waffen-SS.\n\nAlterNet spoke with leading historians and anti-Nazi investigators who condemned the NATO film for rewriting history.\n\n\u201cBy going beyond turning a blind eye to the worship of pro-Hitler forces in Eastern Europe,\u201d said historian Dovid Katz, NATO \u201cis crossing the line right into offering its moral legitimization of Nazi forces such as the Latvian Waffen SS.\u201d\n\nIn order to join the SS in Latvia, recruits swore an oath of loyalty to the German Fuhrer.\n\nKatz is one of the foremost experts on the history of Jews in the Baltic states. He told AlterNet the NATO homage to the Forest Brothers is \u201cvery deeply troubling,\u201d and called it \u201ca hapless accommodation to East European ultranationalism and Holocaust obfuscation and revisionism.\u201d\n\nMany of the members of the Forest Brothers \u201cwere fascists, including some recycled killers from the 1941 genocide phase of the Latvian Holocaust,\u201d Katz explained. The group \u201cserved to delay the Soviet advance (in alliance with the United States, Great Britain and the Allies) that would liberate the death camps further west.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat not all Waffen SS members were \u2018personal killers\u2019\u2014the country's Jews had already been mostly butchered when these units were formed\u2014is quite irrelevant,\u201d Katz added. \u201cIf and when they discovered a Jew in hiding, they did not help him or her.\u201d\n\nAlterNet contacted NATO\u2019s press office with a request for comment, asking why the video did not mention the Forest Brothers\u2019 Nazi links. An individual who asked to be described simply as a NATO official wrote briefly in reply, \u201cThe video is open and transparent about the history of the Forest Brothers. The script notes that \u2018former soldiers who had fought on both sides of the war, now feared for their lives.\u2019\u201d\n\nRewriting the Holocaust to Demonize the Soviets\n\nDovid Katz has written extensively on the whitewashing of Nazi collaborators in the Holocaust, particularly in the Baltic states \u2014 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 which are members of NATO and the European Union. Katz is a regular contributor to the journal Defending History, a scholarly watchdog project whose mission is to \u201cdefend the history of the Holocaust from the onslaught of the New Far Right\u2019s East European campaign (by states, their proxies, and other elites) to downgrade and obfuscate the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nOn Lithuania\u2019s Independence Day in March, Defending History reported that far-right nationalists held a march featuring neo-Nazi music and the Forest Brothers song \u201cLet the Bolsheviks Know.\u201d The participants marched to the presidential palace, where they held a ceremony attacking Lithuania\u2019s oldest Holocaust survivor, Fania Yocheles Brantsovsky, 95. Defending History noted Brantsovsky has been \u201csubjected to defamation by the state\u2019s campaign of Holocaust revisionism.\u201d\n\nEfraim Zuroff, a well-known anti-Nazi activist and historian, also condemned the Forest Brothers film in an email to AlterNet. \u201cThe problem with the screening by NATO of the film on the Forest Brothers is that it presents these men as genuine heroes with a blameless past, when in reality many of them had murdered Jews during the Holocaust,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Forest Brothers\u2019 complicity in the Holocaust \u201cwas in fact one of the reasons that some of them joined the anti-Soviet resistance\u2014to avoid prosecution by the Soviets for their collaboration with the Nazis,\u201d Zuroff added. \u201cThey also committed crimes against innocent civilians in certain cases.\u201d\n\nAmong the civilians murdered by the Forest Brothers, Katz pointed out, were Lithuanian organizers of collective farms overseen by the Soviets in Lithuania. In fact, a prominent director of a development agency in Vilnius, Lithuania was fired by the mayor this July, after he sparked a scandal for posting a Facebook comment asking whether or not it was moral for the Forest Brothers to kill these civilians.\n\nThe historian Samuel D. Gruber has also noted that large sums of money have been spent on preserving sites in Lithuania associated with the Forest Brothers, \u201cmany of whom were ex-fascist collaborators and \u2018Jew-shooters\u2019 who fled into the forests in 1944 to escape the Soviet advance,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNATO\u2019s film on the Forest Brothers is not the first time the Nazi-linked, anti-communist group has been whitewashed. The New York Times did the same in its review of the documentary \u201cThe Invisible Front,\u201d which premiered in 2014 at a historic theater in New York. Yet NATO\u2019s movie is the most high-profile example yet.\n\nDovid Katz stressed in his interview with AlterNet that NATO\u2019s adulation of the Forest Brothers \u201cis in service to the \u2018double genocide\u2019 movement, of which the West still knows so little.\u201d\n\nDouble genocide refers to a form of historical revisionism that depicts the crimes of Nazi Germany and the crimes of the Soviet Union as equal. The talking point, popular among not just neo-fascists, but many conservatives and liberals alike in the West, whitewashes the genocidal crimes against humanity carried out by the Nazis while grossly exaggerating the excesses of the communists.\n\n\u201cHitler\u2019s Axis and the Western Allies were not equal, and shame on NATO for coming on board far-right ultranationalist attempts, rooted in extremism, racism and antisemitism, that seek to rewrite history,\u201d Katz said.\n\nThe Soviet Union lost more people in World War II than any other country; more than 26 million Soviets, including nearly 9 million soldiers, died in the bloodiest war in history. The USSR did the vast majority of the fighting against the Nazi regime. Historians note that three-quarters of Nazi casualties in WWII were caused by the Red Army. Even the Washington Post acknowledged in 2015: \u201cthe Soviet Union saved the world from Hitler.\u201d\n\nToday, however, far-right governments in Eastern Europe are actively rewriting this history.\n\nLatvia is one of several countries that have passed \u201cred-blown laws,\u201d Katz noted. He said these are \u201cshameful\u201d policies that threaten jail time for those who speak out against the false equivalency that depicts Nazi and Soviet crimes as \u201cequal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin current East European politics, and indeed the wider East-West geopolitical scene, attempts to speak up are rapidly knocked down by bogus charges that those who have such concerns must be Putinist agents, adding loss of freedom of expression and democracy for these very East European peoples NATO is supposed to be defending,\u201d Katz added.\n\nFor its part, Russia was enraged by the homage to the Forest Brothers.

He then complained about workers regulations and overtime laws, boasting his belief that \u201cworkers are overprotected.\u201d He also claimed that workers should not have breaks.\n\nOC Weekly reported the following statement from Puzder\u2019s interview:\n\n\u201cHave you ever been to a fast food restaurant and the employees are sitting and you\u2019re wondering, \u2018Why are they sitting?'\u201d Puzder asked. \u201cThey are on what is called a mandatory break.\u201d He shared a laugh with the interviewer, saying the so-called nanny state is why Carl\u2019s Jr. doesn\u2019t open up any new restaurants in California anymore.\n\nAdd that to the existing list of problematic values for someone who is poised to head the U.S. Department of Labor, which as Mother Jones reports, \u201cexists to \u2018foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers,\u2019 as well as to \u2018improve working conditions\u2019 and \u2018assure work-related benefits and rights.'\u201d\n\nEven before the release of this 2009 interview, Puzder was on record as an opponent of raising the minimum wage. He suggested in 2014 that increasing the minimum wage would hurt low-wage workers. At that time, he was earning 291 times more than minimum-wage employees working for his fast-food chains.\n\nPuzder\u2019s company was also hit with a class-action lawsuit in 2013 for \u201callegedly failing to pay its general managers overtime, even while requiring them to be on call 24 hours a day,\u201d according to Law 360.\n\nFormer Labor Secretary Robert Reich slammed Puzder as \u201canti-worker\u201d during a CNN panel earlier this month. He pointed to the fact that \u201cThe Department of Labor came into his restaurants and found that half his restaurants had wage and labor violations that violated the law of the United States.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Puzder is not the most \u201cpro-worker\u201d pick for Trump\u2019s cabinet, which is important given that the president-elect ran his campaign on the basis of making America work again, while catering to the working class."}, "http://www.complex.com/life/2017/10/far-right-youtuber-fatally-stabs-own-father?llid=gWRVr&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=lsls": {"title": "Far-Right Conspiracy Theorist Kills Own Father For Calling Him a Nazi and Racist", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.complex.com/life/2017/10/far-right-youtuber-fatally-stabs-own-father?llid=gWRVr&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=lsls", "text": "Lane Davis, 33, a Trump supporter, conspiracy theorist, and YouTuber known online as Seattle4Truth has been arrested for stabbing his father after he called Lane a Nazi, the Daily Beast reports.\n\nLane spent the majority of his time peddling conspiracy theories online\u2014he was a big Pizzagate advocate, for instance\u2014as well as writing for free as political editor of the fringe blog the Ralph Retort, a site described by the Daily Beast as \u201ceven further to the right\u201d than Breitbart. He was excited about Kid Rock\u2019s potential run for Senate; he wondered whether CNN was \u201cliterally ISIS.\u201d\n\nLane lived with his parents on Samish Island, a small community off the coast of Washington State. The murder happened on the afternoon of July 14. At first, nothing seemed unusual. Lane dove into another of his outbursts, of which apparently he had many. Although his parents usually tolerated his screams, this time they told him to leave the house. In response, Lane began chasing his parents around their home. He spat in his father\u2019s face and screamed that he wanted to kill \u201cpedophiles who were taking over the country.\u201d This is when his mother, Catherine, called the police.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not physically threatening us or anything,\u201d Catherine told the 911 dispatcher. \u201cHe just gets out of control and he\u2019s ranting about stuff from the internet.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher told Catherine and Charles to keep their distance from their son. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to but he\u2019s chasing us around the house,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe\u2019s mad about something on the internet about leftist pedophiles and he thinks we\u2019re leftist and he\u2019s calling us pedophiles. And I don\u2019t know what all.\u201d\n\nCatherine then laughed. \u201cHe just lives on the internet and he gets really worked up about everything that\u2019s going on. He needs an intervention of some kind here.\u201d\n\nAt some point between this call and when the police arrived, Lane became more and more enraged. His father had begun recording his outburst\u2014as he often did, because they were so regular\u2014and Catherine can be heard saying \u201cLeave the knife alone.\u201d This is around the time when Lane stabbed his father in the chest and back with a chef\u2019s knife. Lane then walked outside and waited for the police to arrive with his hands in the air.\n\nAccording to Lane\u2019s confession, the argument with his parents started over \u201cwhether toddlers could consent to sex or not.\u201d His father then called him a Nazi and a racist. Lane is currently held on $1 million bail and has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. His trial is set to begin in January.\n\nLane had worked with Breitbart\u2019s famous asshole Milo Yiannopoulos. In a statement to the Daily Beast, Yiannopoulos distanced himself from Lane.\n\nThe Ralph Retort, the alt-right blog that published Lane\u2019s work almost daily, has also distanced itself from him. In a statement, Nora Ralph, who is running the website while its founder, Ethan Ralph, finishes an eight month jail sentence, announced she would be deleting all of Lane\u2019s work from the website.\n\nLane Davis was a 33-year-old unemployed loser who lived with his parents and had no income to speak of. The man he murdered is the sole reason he was able to subsist at all. He had some volatile anger issues which are evident in the many YouTube streams he\u2019s been present on. He\u2019s also made threats and wild unfounded accusations against a lot of people over the past few years. I thought it was all in jest, but hindsight is always 20-20. Anybody who even slightly disagreed with Lane became the brunt of his verbal attacks and he would often label his detractors as \u201cleftist pedos.\u201d We\u2019ll be working to erase him from this website in the coming days. I don\u2019t care how big his contribution was. A guy that would murder his own father in cold blood doesn\u2019t deserve to be read. No matter how accurate he was in the past, he ended his usefulness to this world when he ended his dad\u2019s life."}, "https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/11/08/three-richest-americans-now-own-more-wealth-bottom-half-us-combined-report": {"title": "Three Richest Americans Now Own More Wealth Than Bottom Half of US Combined: Report", "keywords": ["Economy", " U.S.", " Inequality", " Donald Trump", " Taxation", " Corporate Power"], "url": "https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/11/08/three-richest-americans-now-own-more-wealth-bottom-half-us-combined-report", "text": "In the United States, the 400 richest individuals now own more wealth than the bottom 64 percent of the population and the three richest own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent, while pervasive poverty means one in five households have zero or negative net worth.\n\n\"All combined, households in the bottom one percent have a combined negative net worth of $196 billion.\" \n\n\u2014Billionaire Bonanza\n\nThose are just several of the striking findings of Billionaire Bonanza 2017, a new report (pdf) published Wednesday by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) that explores in detail the speed with which the U.S. is becoming \"a hereditary aristocracy of wealth and power.\"\n\n\"Over recent decades, an incredibly disproportionate share of America's income and wealth gains has flowed to the top of our economic spectrum. At the tip of that top sit the nation's richest 400 individuals, a group that Forbes magazine has been tracking annually since 1982,\" write IPS's Chuck Collins and Josh Hoxie, the report's authors. \"Americans at the other end of our economic spectrum, meanwhile, watch their wages stagnate and savings dwindle.\"\n\nCollins and Hoxie are quick to note that the vast gulf that currently exists between the rich and everyone else is not the product of some inexplicable \"natural phenomenon.\" It is, rather, the result of \"unfair economic policies that benefit those at the top at the expense of those at the bottom.\"\n\nBased on data recently made public by the Forbes 400 list and the Federal Reserve's annual \"Survey of Consumer Finances,\" Billionaire Bonanza examines in detail the principal beneficiaries of America's \"deeply unbalanced economy\": the mega-rich.\n\n\"The wealthiest 25 individuals in the United States today own $1 trillion in combined assets,\" the report notes. \"These 25, a group equivalent to the active roster of a major league baseball team, hold more wealth than the bottom 56 percent of the U.S. population combined, 178 million people.\"\n\nThe top 25 list features billionaires who have attained their vast riches through a variety of means, from inheritance to investing to founding a corporate giant like Amazon or Google. What unites these enormously wealthy individuals\u2014aside from the fact that they are all white\u2014is that they just keep getting richer, decade after decade.\n\nAverage Americans, by contrast, have not fared nearly as well: a significant percentage of the U.S. households \"have no savings at all or owe more than they own,\" making them residents of what Collins and Hoxie term \"Underwater Nation.\"\n\n\"Excluding the value of the family car, 19 percent of U.S. households have zero or negative net worth,\" the report notes. \"Looking at this trend through the lens of race reveals that 30 percent of black households and 27 percent of Latino households have zero or negative wealth.\"\n\nIn order to get a broader sense of the size of the chasm between rich and poor in the U.S., Collins and Hoxie place the net worth of the top one percent and the bottom one percent side by side.\n\n\"The wealthiest 25 individuals in the United States today hold more wealth than the bottom 56 percent of the U.S. population combined, 178 million people.\" \"All combined, households in the bottom one percent have a combined negative net worth of $196 billion,\" the report finds. \"For comparison, the top one percent, a category holding the exact same number of people, have positive $33.4 trillion in combined net worth.\"\n\nEven mainstream institutions like the International Monetary Fund have acknowledged that such vast disparities of wealth and income are not sustainable, politically or economically. But as Billionaire Bonanza notes, the Trump administration\u2014with the help of the GOP-controlled Congress\u2014appears bent on making these disparities worse by slashing taxes for the wealthy while gutting programs that primarily benefit low-income and middle class Americans.\n\nSo the first priority, Collins and Hoxie note, is to \"reject tax and other federal policies that will add oil to the inequality fire.\"\n\nIn terms of going on the offensive once the \"do no harm\" principle is observed, the report makes several suggestions, including:\n\nAs \"the elite ranks of our billionaire class continue to pull apart from the rest of us,\" the report notes, many Americans\u2014including students saddled with loan debt, workers suffering from stagnant wages, and families who have seen \"their wealth and savings evaporate\"\u2014are revolting against the system that allowed the richest to accumulate such wealth at the expense of so many.\n\n\"A century ago, a similar anti-inequality upsurge took on America's vastly unequal distribution of income and wealth and, over the course of little more than a generation, fashioned a much more equal America,\" Collins and Hoxie conclude. \"We can do the same.\""}, "https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/why-malcolm-in-the-middle-is-a-socialist-masterpiece?utm_source=vicetwitteruk": {"title": "Why 'Malcolm in the Middle' Is Actually a Socialist Masterpiece", "keywords": ["culture", " news", " lgbtq", " politics", " journalism", " video", " documentary", " sex", " drugs", " film", " tv", " entertainment", " travel", " crime", "tv", "Malcolm In The Middle", "popular culture", "socialist masterpiece"], "url": "https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/why-malcolm-in-the-middle-is-a-socialist-masterpiece?utm_source=vicetwitteruk", "text": "Almost every episode of Malcolm in the Middle ends with the sound of a door being slammed shut. It returns Malcolm's family \u2013 a combustive medley of troublemakers and misfits \u2013 back to the status quo. This is standard in sitcoms; everything returns to how it was. The difference is, in Malcolm in the Middle, the status quo is bleak. Unlike the characters in, say, Friends, who live comfortably in midtown apartments with lives seemingly unbothered by work, Malcolm's family is poor. Every joke, plot and resolution revolves around this material fact.\n\nI grew up thinking Malcolm in the Middle was a zany show about four quarrelsome brothers and their parents. Re-watching it now it's clear what the show is actually about: the idea that meritocracy is a sham, social institutions are corrupt and wage-labour is cruel. The parents, Hal and Lois, have a comically carnal relationship, which I didn't really understand when I was young. It's a way of protecting themselves from the vicissitudes of capitalism. All the characters are condemned, in one way or another, by the world that surrounds them.\n\nWhile this might sound like heavy stuff for a primetime show on FOX, sitcoms have smuggled in radical ideas before. In fact, there's a reference to this on Malcolm, Dewey and Reece's bedroom wall: a poster of the sitcom Dinosaurs, which ran in the early 1990s on ABC. Dinosaurs is unlike any sitcom America has produced: an anti-capitalist, moralistic puppet show about a family of dinosaurs living on a swampland owned by the FruitCO corporation (a division of WeSaySo enterprises), run by a Trump-esque CEO. It offers a critique of exploitation, sexual harassment and political corruption, and concludes with the family becoming extinct due to a climate change-induced ice age. Dinosaurs was Malcolm's guiding spirit.\n\nIn the beginning Malcolm's family are in debt, perpetually stressed, living in a house that's falling apart. A typical image is Hal and Lois sitting at a kitchen table littered with bills. Lois doesn't have time to go beyond the basic demands of the roles expected of mothers \u2013 cleaning clothes, scrabbling together lunch \u2013 since she's keeping up a low-level service job in a drugstore. Hal works a white-collar clerical job in an office. It's the kind of unproductive, pointless job capitalism makes up just to keep people miserable. He does so little work it's at one point discovered he's never turned up on Fridays, going on day trips by himself to places like Seaworld \u2013 a radical refusal to work if there ever was one.\n\n\"'Malcolm in the Middle' showed that the promises of neoliberalism had always been false.\"\n\n\n\nIn the first episode, Malcolm is recognised to be a genius with an IQ of 165. His underfunded public school puts him in the gifted class, \"the Krelboynes\", where they keep \"all the sort of good things they don't waste on the normal kids\". In a conservative sitcom this would be a rags-to-riches story, his intelligence elevating the family to a prosperous future. But what happens instead is ruthlessly honest. Malcolm's gift doesn't bring him out of his class position; it entrenches it: in the show's finale he gets accepted into Harvard but can only afford the tuition fees by working as the university's janitor at the same time.\n\nThis was all years before the 2008 economic crisis, after which publications started writing about the \"collapsing middle class\" across Western economies, as if everything had been fine before that. Malcolm in the Middle showed that the promises of neoliberalism had always been false: real wages for middle and low wage workers had stagnated since the 1980s, personal debt had mushroomed. When the family has to cancel a summer holiday to pay for Malcolm's hospital bills they make a cost-benefit analysis that's rarely seen on TV, but happens every day across America.\n\nThe show doesn't just depict the struggle of surviving under capitalism, it undermines its ruling ideas. One of the recurring jokes is that the family's poverty is the result of the parents' individual character flaws rather than structural forces. When Lois and Hal are forced to stop having so much sex because of a yeast infection they start obsessively tending to the house and transform it into an idyll of bourgeois living \u2013 the grass grows and the flowers bloom. When Dewey discovers Hal has been secretly smoking, he works out that with the amount he's spent on cigarettes he could have sent Dewey, who's also intellectually gifted, to private school. The jokes parody the Thatcher / Reagan rhetoric that poor people are poor because they don't work hard enough.\n\nRe-watching it now it's clear what the show is actually about: meritocracy is a sham, social institutions are corrupt and wage-labour is cruel. \n\n\n\nTV critics have lauded Malcolm's pioneering use of a single-camera and no laughter track, which led the way for the postmodern comedies of the 2000s. But few commented upon the cast's diversity. Malcolm's best friend, Stevie, isn't just African-American; he's physically disabled and upper middle-class. This isn't some cruel, intersectional joke, like when Lena Dunham responded to a lack of diversity in Girls by writing in a black Republican for two episodes, but a sensitive relationship through which both characters develop. Also, Stevie's conservative family values satirise the \"respectability politics\" \u2013 the idea of \"acting right\" to get ahead in a world of white dominance \u2013 which was seen in programmes like The Cosby Show. (Stevie's jumpers are straight out of The Cosby Show's wardrobe.)\n\nThe same goes for the eldest brother Francis's wife, Piama, who is of Inuit descent. Although there's a pitiful absence of Native American characters in American culture, Piama isn't a token of diversity \u2013 her character is complex. Lois is initially distrustful of her for taking away her son, but they form a sense of solidarity over a shared enjoyment of punishing their useless partners \u2013 smashing up Francis and Hal's stuff when they go on a selfish motorbike trip by themselves.\n\nIt's become obligatory recently for critics to end reviews by attempting to integrate pop culture into the contemporary political climate \u2013 an impulse that has, at times, felt over-laboured. But as politics becomes increasingly senseless, it's harder to detach it from culture at large. Completely immersing myself in Malcolm's world, I have such sympathy for their lives that I can't help but wonder how they would fare in Trump's America. Probably not well.\n\nThen I had a scarier thought: what if they voted for him? Although Trump's success depended on multiple demographics \u2013 college-educated, wealthy whites were crucial \u2013 as a white family in a low income-bracket somewhere in an undefined midwestern state, Malcolm's family would have been a key demographic to mobilise; possibly part of the considerable swing from poorer Democrats to Republicans that helped Trump clinch it. Could Lois and Hal have been convinced by Trump's promises to bring back high wages and an export-based economy? Would they have been fooled by his anti-establishment disguise and found catharsis in a protest vote?\n\nI soothed this admittedly strange worry \u2013 that my favourite sitcom family could have been Trump supporters \u2013 by considering a more plausible outcome. When Election Day came round, amid the stress of poorly remunerated work, the anxiety of debt repayments and the chaos of putting out their children's fires, Lois and Hal would have, like millions of others, been too busy \u2013 or perhaps cynical \u2013 to care. If Malcolm in the Middle articulates the experience of any particular demographic, it's those who simply didn't vote."}, "http://www.eurasiareview.com/30092016-oops-they-did-it-again-us-misdirected-drone-strike-on-somalia-kills-22-civilians-soldiers-oped/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+eurasiareview%2FVsnE+%28Eurasia+Review%29": {"title": "Oops They Did it Again: US \u2018Misdirected\u2019 Drone Strike On Somalia Kills 22 Civilians, Soldiers \u2013 OpEd", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.eurasiareview.com/30092016-oops-they-did-it-again-us-misdirected-drone-strike-on-somalia-kills-22-civilians-soldiers-oped/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+eurasiareview%2FVsnE+%28Eurasia+Review%29", "text": "In what the US is calling a \u201cmisdirected\u201d airstrike, some 22 Somali citizens and soldiers were killed by a US missile fired from a drone intended to take out al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabab militia members.

All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.\n\nWhere is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?\n\nTwo things result from this fact:\n\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.\n\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.\n\nTo this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.\n\nThe history of all hitherto existing society(2) is the history of class struggles.\n\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master(3) and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\n\nIn the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.\n\nThe modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.\n\nOur epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other \u2014 Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\n\nFrom the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.\n\nThe discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.\n\nThe feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.\n\nMeantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.\n\nModern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.\n\nWe see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.\n\nEach step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune(4): here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); there taxable \"third estate\" of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.\n\nThe bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.\n\nThe bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \"natural superiors\", and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash payment\". It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom \u2014 Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.\n\nThe bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.\n\nThe bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.\n\nThe bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man's activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.\n\nThe bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\n\nThe need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.\n\nThe bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.\n\nThe bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.\n\nThe bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.\n\nThe bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier, and one customs-tariff.\n\nThe bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature's forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground \u2014 what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?\n\nWe see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.\n\nInto their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class.\n\nA similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity \u2014 the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.\n\nThe weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.\n\nBut not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons \u2014 the modern working class \u2014 the proletarians.\n\nIn proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed \u2014 a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.\n\nOwing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery, etc.\n\nModern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.\n\nThe less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.\n\nNo sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.\n\nThe lower strata of the middle class \u2014 the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants \u2014 all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.\n\nThe proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the operative of one trade, in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.\n\nAt this stage, the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeois. Thus, the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie.\n\nBut with the development of industry, the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The increasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon, the workers begin to form combinations (Trades' Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there, the contest breaks out into riots.\n\nNow and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry, and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, the modern proletarian, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.\n\nThis organisation of the proletarians into a class, and, consequently into a political party, is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus, the ten-hours' bill in England was carried.\n\nAltogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles, it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie.\n\nFurther, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling class are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.\n\nFinally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.\n\nOf all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.\n\nThe lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance, they are revolutionary, they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.\n\nThe \"dangerous class\", [lumpenproletariat] the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.\n\nIn the condition of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations; modern industry labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.\n\nAll the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.\n\nAll previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.\n\nThough not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.\n\nIn depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.\n\nHitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of the feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a bourgeois. The modern labourer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the process of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.\n\nThe essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.\n\nIn what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?\n\nThe Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.\n\nThey have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.\n\nThey do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.\n\nThe Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.\n\nThe Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.\n\nThe immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.\n\nThe theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.\n\nThey merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.\n\nAll property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.\n\nThe French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\n\nIn this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.\n\nWe Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.\n\nHard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.\n\nOr do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?\n\nBut does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.\n\nTo be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.\n\nCapital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.\n\nWhen, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.\n\nLet us now take wage-labour.\n\nThe average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.\n\nIn bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour. In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\n\nIn bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.\n\nAnd the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.\n\nBy freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.\n\nBut if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other \"brave words\" of our bourgeois about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.\n\nYou are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.\n\nIn one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend.\n\nFrom the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say, individuality vanishes.\n\nYou must, therefore, confess that by \"individual\" you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.\n\nCommunism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations.\n\nIt has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.\n\nAccording to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything do not work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when there is no longer any capital.\n\nAll objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture.\n\nThat culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine.\n\nBut don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, &c. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class.\n\nThe selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property \u2013 historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production \u2013 this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property.\n\nAbolition [Aufhebung] of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.\n\nOn what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.\n\nThe bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.\n\nDo you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.\n\nBut, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.\n\nAnd your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, &c.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.\n\nThe bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.\n\nBut you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the bourgeoisie in chorus.\n\nThe bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.\n\nHe has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.\n\nFor the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.\n\nOur bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.\n\nBourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.\n\nThe Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality.\n\nThe working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.\n\nNational differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.\n\nThe supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.\n\nIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\n\nThe charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.\n\nDoes it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views, and conception, in one word, man's consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?\n\nWhat else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.\n\nWhen people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society, they do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.\n\nWhen the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" it will be said, \"religious, moral, philosophical, and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change.\"\n\n\"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.\"\n\nWhat does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.\n\nBut whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.\n\nThe Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.\n\nBut let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.\n\nWe have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.\n\nThe proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.\n\nOf course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.\n\nThese measures will, of course, be different in different countries.\n\nNevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.\n\n1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. \n\n 2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. \n\n 3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. \n\n 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. \n\n 5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. \n\n 6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. \n\n 7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. \n\n 8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. \n\n 9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country. \n\n 10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c.\n\nWhen, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.\n\nIn place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\n\nOwing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society. In the French Revolution of July 1830, and in the English reform agitation[A], these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political struggle was altogether out of the question. A literary battle alone remained possible. But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.(1)\n\nIn order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe.\n\nIn this way arose feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon; half an echo of the past, half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart's core; but always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history.\n\nThe aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.\n\nOne section of the French Legitimists and \"Young England\" exhibited this spectacle.\n\nIn pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now antiquated. In showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society.\n\nFor the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeois amounts to this, that under the bourgeois r\u00e9gime a class is being developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society.\n\nWhat they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat.\n\nIn political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class; and in ordinary life, despite their high-falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter truth, love, and honour, for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits.(2)\n\nAs the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.\n\nNothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.\n\nThe feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society. The medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. In those countries which are but little developed, industrially and commercially, these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie.\n\nIn countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed, fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie, and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society. The individual members of this class, however, are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society, to be replaced in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.\n\nIn countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population, it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use, in their criticism of the bourgeois r\u00e9gime, the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes, should take up the cudgels for the working class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi was the head of this school, not only in France but also in England.\n\nThis school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists. It proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.\n\nIn its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange, and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange within the framework of the old property relations that have been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means. In either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.\n\nIts last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture; patriarchal relations in agriculture.\n\nUltimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues.\n\nThe Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and that was the expressions of the struggle against this power, was introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.\n\nGerman philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits (men of letters), eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when these writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social conditions had not immigrated along with them. In contact with German social conditions, this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance and assumed a purely literary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of the Eighteenth Century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing more than the demands of \"Practical Reason\" in general, and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified, in their eyes, the laws of pure Will, of Will as it was bound to be, of true human Will generally.\n\nThe work of the German literati consisted solely in bringing the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view.\n\nThis annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated, namely, by translation.\n\nIt is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written. The German literati reversed this process with the profane French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money, they wrote \"Alienation of Humanity\", and beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote \"Dethronement of the Category of the General\", and so forth.\n\nThe introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the French historical criticisms, they dubbed \"Philosophy of Action\", \"True Socialism\", \"German Science of Socialism\", \"Philosophical Foundation of Socialism\", and so on.\n\nThe French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having overcome \"French one-sidedness\" and of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of Truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.\n\nThis German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such a mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence.\n\nThe fight of the Germans, and especially of the Prussian bourgeoisie, against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the liberal movement, became more earnest.\n\nBy this, the long-wished for opportunity was offered to \"True\" Socialism of confronting the political movement with the Socialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism, against representative government, against bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by this bourgeois movement. German Socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that the French criticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.\n\nTo the absolute governments, with their following of parsons, professors, country squires, and officials, it served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.\n\nIt was a sweet finish, after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets, with which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the German working-class risings.\n\nWhile this \"True\" Socialism thus served the government as a weapon for fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of German Philistines. In Germany, the petty-bourgeois class, a relic of the sixteenth century, and since then constantly cropping up again under the various forms, is the real social basis of the existing state of things.\n\nTo preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. The industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction \u2014 on the one hand, from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat. \"True\" Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.\n\nThe robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry \"eternal truths\", all skin and bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public.\n\nAnd on its part German Socialism recognised, more and more, its own calling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois Philistine.\n\nIt proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the German petty Philistine to be the typical man. To every villainous meanness of this model man, it gave a hidden, higher, Socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. It went to the extreme length of directly opposing the \"brutally destructive\" tendency of Communism, and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles. With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist and Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.(3)\n\nA part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society.\n\nTo this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class, organisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.\n\nWe may cite Proudhon's Philosophie de la Mis\u00e8re as an example of this form.\n\nThe Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society, minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.\n\nA second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economical relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.\n\nBourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech.\n\nFree trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class. Prison Reform: for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism.\n\nIt is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois \u2014 for the benefit of the working class.\n\nWe do not here refer to that literature which, in every great modern revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.\n\nThe first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends, made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society was being overthrown, necessarily failed, owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation, conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form.\n\nThe Socialist and Communist systems, properly so called, those of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, and others, spring into existence in the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians).\n\nThe founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement.\n\nSince the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry, the economic situation, as they find it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat. They therefore search after a new social science, after new social laws, that are to create these conditions.\n\nHistorical action is to yield to their personal inventive action; historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones; and the gradual, spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat to an organisation of society especially contrived by these inventors. Future history resolves itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans.\n\nIn the formation of their plans, they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.\n\nThe undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favoured. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without the distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society?\n\nHence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel.\n\nSuch fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position, correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society.\n\nBut these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical element. They attack every principle of existing society. Hence, they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class. The practical measures proposed in them \u2014 such as the abolition of the distinction between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the function of the state into a more superintendence of production \u2014 all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and which, in these publications, are recognised in their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore, are of a purely Utopian character.\n\nThe significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an inverse relation to historical development. In proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all theoretical justification. Therefore, although the originators of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast by the original views of their masters, in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They still dream of experimental realisation of their social Utopias, of founding isolated \"phalansteres\", of establishing \"Home Colonies\", or setting up a \"Little Icaria\"(4) \u2014 duodecimo editions of the New Jerusalem \u2014 and to realise all these castles in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois. By degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary [or] conservative Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more systematic pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science.\n\nThey, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class; such action, according to them, can only result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.\n\nThe Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and the R\u00e9formistes.\n\nSection II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.\n\nThe Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement. In France, the Communists ally with the Social-Democrats(1) against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.\n\nIn Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.\n\nIn Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.\n\nIn Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.\n\nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instill into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.\n\nThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth, and France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.\n\nIn short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.\n\nIn all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.\n\nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.\n\nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win."}, "https://redflag.org.au/article/no-islam-not-race-yes-you-are-still-racist": {"title": "No, Islam is not a race. Yes, you are still a racist | Red Flag", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://redflag.org.au/article/no-islam-not-race-yes-you-are-still-racist", "text": "Anti-Islamic bigotry is racism. How can that be when, as is frequently pointed out, Islam isn\u2019t a race?\n\nBiological race doesn\u2019t exist. But the concept of biological race is an invention with a long history. Its transformations help answer the question.\n\nOne of the earliest and most detailed systems of biological racial classification existed in the French colony of St Dominguez. According to the historian C.L.R. James, the system of classification contained more than 150 gradations of \u201cblackness\u201d.\n\nOnly people who could prove that they were \u201cpurely white\u201d were granted full rights. This system was overthrown by a slave rebellion and revolution. The \u201caristocracy of skin\u201d, a term used by the Parisian masses to describe racism, was temporarily defeated. Those 150 gradations of blackness, which were regarded as a natural fact, have long been forgotten.\n\nRoughly 80 years later, biological racism enjoyed a renaissance, as all sorts of new so-called races were discovered. This was the advent of pseudo-scientific Darwinian racism. For example, the Irish were considered a separate race to the English, and closer to apes. Skulls were measured, intellects compared and, lo and behold, the Irish were found inferior. This conveniently explained the Irish famine, in which between 800,000 and 1.5 million people starved to death while the British exported their food.\n\nNowhere did social Darwinism go further than in Germany. Prior to the late 1880s, Jewishness had been regarded purely as a religion. Of course, Jews had suffered religious discrimination, but they could escape this through conversion, as many did. Yet, from the late 1800s onward, with the aid of \u201cscience\u201d, Jewishness was transformed into a race, which was then associated with a series of visual and cultural markers, involving facial hair, big noses, dishonesty and suspicious customs such as kosher food.\n\nThese examples highlight how racism was never really about \u201cnatural\u201d differences. It was a manufactured ideology of oppression. Racism is really about power.\n\nBiologically linked racism started to go out of fashion with the fall of the Third Reich. But this didn\u2019t mean that racism disappeared. It just changed form.\n\nTake the example of the USA. Since the Declaration of Independence, the USA has concealed real inequality under a constitution and political system premised on formal equality.\n\nIn the past, the contradiction between real and formal inequality was justified by the alleged inferiority of non-white races. But the struggles and achievements of those non-whites increasingly made such claims untenable.\n\nToday, no one credible argues that inequality and poverty stem from innate racial differences. Rather, we are told that \u201ccultural problems\u201d are to blame. The new rationalisation is not biologically based, yet it is the politically acceptable code for the same old racism.\n\nAnti-Muslim racism, which exploded following 9/11 and the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, fits into this mould. Small-l liberals have played a special role in promoting it. The polite arguments that Islam is more repressive than other religions, that Muslims lack respect for women or democracy, or are particularly violent, are all coded signals which, like a dog whistle, prick the ears of rabid, frothing-at-the-mouth racists.\n\nThis is what happened at the Cronulla riot in 2005, where men of Arab appearance were bashed by a white mob trying to defend \u201ctheir\u201d beach and \u201ctheir\u201d women. It was referred to by participants as \u201cLeb and wog bashing day\u201d.\n\nRacism always relies on stereotypes and visual or cultural markers. So, the racists portray Muslims as big-nosed, fat, fanatical, bearded misogynists who want to slaughter animals and non-believers alike, impose sharia law, prohibit tasty food and beverages, destroy liberty and reason and generally fuck things up for the \u201cenlightened\u201d West.\n\nWhy do they want to do this? Well, who knows, but one thing is for sure \u2013 they aren\u2019t as civilised as us.\n\nAll of these tropes are based on racial stereotypes of Arab people, which are as old as they are repulsive. Edward Said\u2019s magnificent book Orientalism traces this tradition of representation through Western art and literature. It turns out that \u201cgood Muslim\u201d vs. \u201cbad Muslim\u201d is just an updated version of the colonial era \u201cgood savage\u201d vs. \u201cbad savage\u201d trope.\n\nChristopher Hitchens took war-mongering atheism to new depths when he endorsed cluster bombs and said that the death toll in the Iraq war wasn\u2019t high enough. But the tradition of atheism and Enlightenment values being used as the spear tip for colonial-style racism goes at least as far back as the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt.\n\nRacism has changed with the times, but it is still a system of oppression that commits violence towards whole swaths of humanity, who are depicted through a few crude stereotypes.\n\nSo sure, Islam is a religion. But the statement \u201cIslam is a religion, not a race\u201d remains the most transparent of covers for real racism."}, "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/prison-revolt-refuse-slaves/": {"title": "Media Silent as the World's Largest Prison Population Revolts -- \"Refuses To Be Slaves Any Longer\"", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/prison-revolt-refuse-slaves/", "text": "(RT) On the 45th anniversary of the famous Attica riot, inmates across the US are attempting to bring attention to the dire circumstances that prison populations endure, in the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world, by going on strike.\n\nSeptember 9, 2016 marks 45 years since the prisoners in New York\u2019s Attica Correctional Facility took over the prison to demand humane treatment. In the four-and-a-half decades since then, little has improved, according to those living behind bars.\n\nInmates are protesting a myriad of problems facing the incarcerated population, such as the low wages they receive for work they are required to do by penitentiaries that benefit the facilities themselves and private companies that contract out labor to prisons.\n\nSome inmates\u2019 grievances were outlined in a list of demands posted on the Industrial Workers of the World Incarcerated Workers\u2019 Facebook page, containing complaints about the conditions prisoners in South Carolina face.\n\nIncluded on the list of seemingly basic human rights was an end to free labor by prisoners in the Palmetto State, where private companies were criticized for using prisoners as skilled labor but paying them under $2 an hour.\n\nIn addition, prisoners demanded an opportunity for education and rehabilitation programs as well as an end to \u201cthe practice of in camera video doctor visits for medical and mental health concerns.\u201d\n\nThe Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC), the organization behind the strike, referred to it as \u201ca Call to Action Against Slavery in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope to end prison slavery by making it impossible, by refusing to be slaves any longer,\u201d they explained.\n\nThe uprising at Attica 45 years ago made similar demands, as IWOC\u2019s co-chair Azzurra Crispino explained to RT.\n\n\u201cInmates in Attica were rioting for many of the same conditions that inmates are striking for today,\u201d Crispino said, \u201can end to prison slavery, human dignity, adequate access to medical care, adequate access to wages.\u201d\n\nThe last one is a big one. While inmates across the country are protesting many problems, such as being served moldy food or, such as in Texas, being confined to concrete cells with no air conditioning with temperatures reaching over 100 degrees (38 C), the labor issue by sheer volume is the most contentious.\n\nThere are over 900,000 inmates working out of the 2.4 million prisoners in the country.\n\nIn some states, calling the DMV means the person on the other end of the phone is an inmate, certain brands of underwear have been sewn by the incarcerated, and the cost of prison operations is offset by inmates who are tasked with keeping the facilities running by providing food, maintenance and labor. However, many of them will be lucky to receive even a dime for their work.\n\nAll inmates at Alabama\u2019s William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore refused to report to their jobs as part of the strike. A contact inside told Support Prisoner Resistance, \u201call inmates at Holman Prison refused to report to their prison jobs without incident. With the rising of the sun came an eerie silence as the men at Holman laid on their racks reading or sleeping. Officers are performing all tasks.\u201d\n\nHowever, with the fifth highest incarceration rate in the country, the Alabama Department of Corrections has a backup plan. Should the protest continue, inmates in a nearby work release facility will take over work at the tag plane, WNCF reported. The plant is \u201cwhere all of the State\u2019s motor vehicle tags are manufactured,\u201d according to the prison\u2019s website.\n\nSlave labor in the US is banned under the Constitution\u2019s Thirteenth Amendment, save for one clause: people who are \u201cduly convicted\u201d of a crime.\n\n\u201cThe 13th Amendment of the Constitution, most people believe ended slavery but it didn\u2019t,\u201d Crispino told RT. \u201cIt just made people convicted of a crime to be made to work without pay.\u201d\n\nAlex Friedmann, managing editor of Prison Legal News and the associate director of the Human Rights Defense Center,told CBS News: \u201cThat\u2019s why none of these protections, such as worker protections, apply to prisoners. So under the 13th Amendment, they\u2019re basically worked as slaves, and if they don\u2019t work, they\u2019re punished.\u201d\n\nThis is why wages for prisoners fall well below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, reaching bottoms of 15 cents an hour, while some states are allowed to not pay their prisoners at all. Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas are all allowed to force inmates to work for free, the Nation reported.\n\nMeanwhile, large corporations, such as Victoria\u2019s Secret or AT&T, are allowed to sell work contracts to state and federal prisons that outsource work to earn them billions of dollars. In addition, some states use prison work programs as means to make products for state use.\n\nNew York State\u2019s Corcraft produces everything from lockers to uniforms for \u201cgovernment agencies (including other states).\u201d\n\nThis is what has led prisoners across the country to participate in a national strike.\n\n\u201cWe want to people to understand the economics of the prison system,\u201d Melvin Brooks-Ray, founder of the Free Alabama Movement and former inmate, told Wired. \u201cIt\u2019s not about crime and punishment. It\u2019s about money.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, protests across the country took place to show solidarity with the protesters behind bars.\n\nThe full effect of the protests will not be known until later, but perhaps this will be one step closer to fixing the problems that persist in the country that holds 25 percent of the world\u2019s incarcerated population."}, "http://www.newsweek.com/trump-was-laughed-world-leaders-dissing-socialism-667785": {"title": "Trump was laughed at by world leaders at the U.N. for dissing socialism", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/trump-was-laughed-world-leaders-dissing-socialism-667785", "text": "When President Donald Trump criticized socialism during his speech Tuesday at the United Nations, he seemed to expect roaring approval from the audience. Instead, world leaders responded with laughter and weak applause.\n\nIt was perhaps the most awkward moment of Trump's speech.\n\nSpeaking on the recent crisis in Venezuela, Trump said, \"The problem...is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented.\"\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\"From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure,\" Trump added.\n\nIn the middle of his comments, Trump paused to take the room's temperature, but it was apparent world leaders were unmoved by the rebuke of the worker state. The room was silent. It was reminiscent of Jeb Bush's \"please clap\" moment.\n\nConservative commentator Bill O'Reilly perhaps described it best: \"Most fascinating part of Trump [United Nations] speech: After lambasting socialism, he paused, perhaps waiting for applause. None came. Stony silence.\"\n\nVideo of the speech has immortalized the uncomfortable moment:\n\nVenezuela reacted by saying in a statement that Trump's \"fatal obsession\" with the country is \"a product of his white supremacist ideas.\" So at least one government gave Trump specific feedback, even if it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nTrump's comment\u2014and the general response\u2014reveal a lot about the way America sees socialism, compared with the rest of the globe.\n\nIn the U.S., socialism is still a dirty word. Just 35 percent of Americans view the system positively, compared with 60 percent who view capitalism favorably, according to a May 2016 Gallup poll.\n\nIn addition to the bleak conditions in some countries associated with socialism (like Venezuela), the Cold War seems to have ingrained in the U.S. an inherently negative view of socialism. Many wrongly believe socialism and communism are interchangeable.\n\nThere is growing support for socialism\u2014and a growing rejection of capitalism\u2014among millennials, who entered adulthood well after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThis likely helps explain why younger voters overwhelmingly supported self-declared democratic socialist Bernie Sanders when he ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. It might also reveal why a significant number of Democrats have come forward to support Senator Sanders's universal health care bill, which critics, predictably, deride as socialized medicine.\n\nRepealing Obamacare \"is about stopping a march towards socialism,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham recently said.\n\nMeanwhile, in other parts of the developed world, socialism is not something that sends people running for the hills.\n\nMost industrialized countries, for example, have implemented universal health care. Moreover, Norway was recently ranked the happiest country in the world, and it pointed to its strong state-support programs as crucial to achieving this accolade. Apparently, people like to know those around them have their back if times get tough.\n\nSeveral other Scandinavian countries, including Denmark, Iceland and Sweden, were also among the top 10 happiest countries in the world, according to the most recent figures. Like Norway, all of these countries have robust social welfare programs, though none have implemented full-blown socialism.\n\nThe U.S., however, can't even make it into the top 10 happiest countries.

The protests were largely peaceful, although in some cities, especially the larger ones, the ruling class was determined to stop the movement by any means necessary. This led to intense confrontations where the police violently attacked the crowds with batons, rubber bullets and teargas canisters.\n\nFlorianopolis - Photo: Esquerda MarxistaThe general strike encompassed almost all sections of the Brazilian working class, including the municipal workers, the public transport workers, bank employees, postal workers, university teachers, public and private school workers, and taxi drivers. The metal workers' union also declared that 60,000 of its members struck.\n\nReports coming from Sao Paulo described the city as \u201cin lockdown\u201d with all roads and railways paralysed, and blockades being set up, limiting access to the main airport. In the capital, Brasilia, there were reports of bus drivers refusing to end demonstrations despite threats from police officers, as well as roadblocks on major highways going into the city and to the airport. An angry crowd also attempted to march on President Michel Temer\u2019s home. It was stopped by police who fired rubber bullets and stun grenades. The struggle intensified with protesters hurling rocks, lighting fires, and throwing concrete blocks into the centre of the avenue. A striking bank employee told the Telegraph: \u201cWe can't keep quiet anymore with a government that isn't legitimate, which wasn't elected to dismantle the rights of workers.\u201d\n\nJoinville - Photo: Esquerda MarxistaThe Brazilian section of the International Marxist Tendency - Esquerda Marxista - was also present in many cities across Brazil during the demonstrations. In the city of Joinville, the largest in the Santa Catarina state, the organization led more than 7,000 protesters in an event arranged together with one of the local unions (Sinsej). As the day progressed, municipal workers, students, state and private education workers, electricians, bankers, among countless others, joined forces and marched, shouting slogans such as \"Out with Temer and the National Congress!\u201d and \"If pushed, Temer will fall!\u201d. Figures published by the weekly newspaper Brasil de Fato report a total turnout of 35 million workers, making the strike the biggest in Brazilian history.\n\nDespite this, President Temer\u2019s statement after the strike claimed that it consisted only of \"small groups\u201d, and promised that his \u201cwork toward the modernization of national legislation will continue\u201d.\n\nThe Temer government and the Brazilian political elite represent the core interests of Brazilian capitalism. In a time of economic crisis, this means brutally attacking workers\u2019 rights and living standards in order to defend the profits and privileges of this capitalist class. The result is that for the majority of the working class and the poor it is impossible to maintain a decent life.\n\nOn Thursday, the day before the strike, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that elite public servants could collect salaries above $140,000 a year, despite this being set as the maximum limit in the Brazilian constitution. Meanwhile, half of the Brazilian population, more than 100 million people, earn just around the minimum wage of $4,000 a year. As the austerity measures of the Temer government are being carried through, and the economy in recession for the past two years, the unemployment rate has sky-rocketed to almost 15%. The result, according to a poll by Ibope on Friday, has been a collapse in the government's approval rating to just 10%, with 55% actively disapproving of its management of the country.\n\nTemer and his government defend their measures, however. They claim these policies are necessary, and proudly boast about the achievement of having raised the Brazilian stock market by 20% percent in the past year, which means nothing to Brazilian workers.\n\nWith the attacks of the ruling class on the working class, we will not have to wait another two decades for another general strike. In a period of deep crisis like today, capitalism is forced to continuously attack the working class, its rights and its living standards; attacks which are getting more severe and harder to endure. This means we are witnessing the opening up of a period of intense class struggle and revolutionary upheavals.\n\nThe strikes across the country reflect the radicalised mood which has been brewing within the working class. With widespread corruption and with the prospect of better living standards more distant than ever before, workers are beginning to take matters into their own hands. Within a capitalist system in deep crisis, none of these things are achievable. To rid Brazil of corruption and oppression a whole new system is needed. A wide layer of the youth are already reaching such radical conclusions. Socialist youth movements such as Liberdade e Luta, promoted by Esquerda Marxista, have in the past year seen huge success in uniting students in the fight for an equal society no longer bound by the chains of capitalism. This is an anticipation of the developments which are to come in the wider layers of the working class in the next period."}, "http://www.alternet.org/activism/media-busy-creating-left-wing-threat-balance-out-awful-racist-right-wing-hordes-who": {"title": "Trump's Media Pals Are Busy Creating a Left-Wing 'Threat' to Balance Out the Awful Racist Right-Wing Hordes That Threaten Civil Society", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.alternet.org/activism/media-busy-creating-left-wing-threat-balance-out-awful-racist-right-wing-hordes-who", "text": "Trump's Media Pals Are Busy Creating a Left-Wing 'Threat' to Balance Out the Awful Racist Right-Wing Hordes That Threaten Civil Society\n\nIn these dark days, an intergenerational warning is in order: Antifa folks, be wary. They are coming for you.\n\nSome of us have seen this movie before. In my generation, when I was a teenage member of MSU\u2019s SDS in the late 1960s, I remember the guy who was always yelling, \u201cKill the pigs,\u201d and encouraging us to burn down the ROTC building on campus. In later years, I heard from old SDS colleagues that when they sued the police, they learned that the outspoken guy was a police officer and his friends were informants.\n\nFor my dad\u2019s generation, the right-wing takeover of a protest movement happened in Germany generations ago, so most Americans don\u2019t even recognize Marinus van der Lubbe\u2019s name. But the Germans remember well that fateful day 84 years ago: Feb. 27, 1933. And many of them are looking at the confrontations in our streets and worrying.\n\nIt started when the government, struggling with questions of its own legitimacy and the instability of its leader, received reports of an imminent terrorist attack. Historians are still debating whether the \u201cterrorist\u201d was a mentally incompetent young man maneuvered into place to take the fall for the crime, or was an actual communist ideologue (of limited intellectual means and probably schizophrenic; that seems to be one thing most agree on).\n\nBut the warnings of investigators were ignored at the highest levels, in part because the government was distracted; the man who claimed to be the nation's leader had not been elected by a majority vote and the people claimed he had no right to the powers he coveted.\n\nHe was a simpleton, some said, a cartoon character of a man who saw things in black-and-white terms and didn't have the intellect to understand the subtleties of running a nation in a complex and internationalist world. His coarse use of language, reflecting his background of hanging out with disreputable sorts, and his simplistic and often-inflammatory nationalistic rhetoric offended the aristocrats, foreign leaders, and the well-educated elite in the government and media.\n\nHe desperately wanted to be appreciated and loved by the \u201cold money\u201d crowd, but he also hated them because they had never accepted him and, deep down inside, he knew they never would.\n\nNonetheless, he knew the terrorist was going to strike, and he had already considered his response. When an aide brought him word that the nation's most prestigious building was ablaze, he rushed to the scene and called a press conference.\n\n\"You are now witnessing the beginning of a great epoch in history,\" Hitler proclaimed, standing in front of the burned-out German Parliament building, surrounded by national media.\n\n\"This fire,\" he said, his voice trembling with emotion, \"is the beginning.\" He used the occasion\u2014\"a sign from God,\" he called it\u2014to declare an \u201call-out war on terrorism\u201d and its ideological sponsors, a people, he said, who traced their origins to the Middle East and found motivation for their evil deeds in their religion.\n\nAnd, he said, their fellow travelers \u2014\"communists\u201d like the man who\u2019d set the Reichstag on fire\u2014needed to be tracked down and utterly destroyed.\n\nTwo weeks later, the first detention center for terrorists was built in Oranianburg to hold the first suspected allies of the infamous terrorist. In a national outburst of patriotism, the leader's flag was everywhere, even printed large in newspapers suitable for window display.\n\nWithin four weeks of the terrorist attack, the nation's now-popular leader had pushed through legislation, in the name of combating terrorism and fighting the philosophy he said spawned it, that suspended constitutional guarantees of free speech, privacy, and habeas corpus.\n\nPolice could now intercept mail and wiretap phones; suspected terrorists could be imprisoned without specific charges and without access to their lawyers; police could sneak into people's homes without warrants and peek around without homeowners know it, if the cases involved terrorism.\n\nTo get his patriotic \"Decree on the Protection of People and State\" passed over the objections of concerned legislators and civil libertarians, he agreed to put a four-year sunset provision on it: if the national emergency provoked by the terrorist attack was over by then, the freedoms and rights would be returned to the people, and the police agencies would be re-restrained. Just like with America\u2019s recent Patriot Act, the first version of which had sunset provisions, legislators would later say they hadn't had time to read the bill before voting on it.\n\nImmediately after passage of the anti-terrorism act, his federal police agencies stepped up their program of arresting suspicious persons and holding them without access to lawyers or courts. In the first year only a few hundred were interred, and those who objected were largely ignored by the mainstream press, which was afraid to offend and thus lose access to a leader who was so newsworthy.\n\nCitizens who protested the leader in public\u2014 and there were many\u2014quickly found themselves confronting the newly empowered police's batons, gas, and jail cells, or fenced off in protest zones safely out of earshot of the leader's public speeches. (In the meantime, he was constantly talking up the threat of these \u201cother people\u201d among the German people, while armed gangs terrorized minorities and smashed windows in Jewish-owned businesses.)\n\nWithin the first months after that terrorist attack, at the suggestion of a political adviser, he brought a formerly obscure word into common usage. He wanted to stir a \"racial pride\" among his white countrymen, so instead of referring to the nation by its name, he began to refer to it as the \"Homeland,\" a phrase publicly promoted in the introduction to a 1934 speech recorded in Leni Riefenstahl's famous propaganda movie \"Triumph of the Will.\"\n\nAs hoped, people's hearts swelled with pride, and the beginning of an us-versus-them mentality was sewn. Our land was the homeland, citizens thought: all others were simply foreign lands. We are the \"true people,\" he suggested, the only ones worthy of our nation's concern; if bombs fall on others, or human rights are violated in other nations and it makes our lives better, it's of little concern to us.\n\nPlaying on this new nationalism, and exploiting a disagreement with the French over his increasing militarism, he argued that any international body that didn't put Germany first was neither relevant nor useful. He thus withdrew his country from the League of Nations in October, 1933, and then negotiated a separate naval armaments agreement with Anthony Eden of the United Kingdom.\n\nHis propaganda minister orchestrated a campaign to ensure the people that he was supported by the power brokers of the most fervent of Germany\u2019s Christian sects. He even proclaimed the need for a revival of the Christian faith across his nation, what he called a \"New Christianity.\" Every man in his rapidly growing army wore a belt buckle that declared \"Gott mit uns\" (God is with us) and most of them fervently believed it was true.\n\nWithin a year of the terrorist attack, the nation's leader determined that the various local police and federal agencies around the nation were lacking the clear communication and overall coordinated administration necessary to deal with the terrorist threat facing the nation, particularly the troublesome \"intellectuals\" and \"liberals.\"\n\nHe proposed a single new national agency to protect the security of the Homeland, consolidating the actions of dozens of previously independent police, border, and investigative agencies under a single leader. He appointed one of his most trusted associates to be leader of this new agency, the Central Security Office for the Homeland, and gave it a role in the government equal to the other major departments.\n\nHis assistant who dealt with the press noted that, since the terrorist attack, \"Radio and press are at our disposal.\" Those voices questioning the legitimacy of their nation's leader, or raising questions about his checkered past, had by now faded from the public's recollection, as his central security office began advertising a \u201cSee Something, Say Something\u201d program encouraging people to phone in tips about suspicious neighbors.\n\nThose denounced often included opposition politicians and celebrities who dared speak out\u2014a favorite target of his regime. He began a campaign to discredit the press; he called them the L\u00fcgenpresse, or \"lying press\" (\u201cfake news\u201d in today\u2019s vernacular). The phrase was repeated endlessly until all the free press was shut down in 1934. By 1935, all the radio stations and newspapers were owned by wealthy, hard-right friends of his regime.\n\nTo consolidate his power, he concluded that government alone wasn't enough. He reached out to industry and forged an alliance, bringing former executives of the nation's largest corporations into high government positions. A flood of government money poured into corporate coffers to fight the war against the \u201cleftist terrorists\u201d lurking within the Homeland, and to prepare for wars overseas.\n\nHe encouraged large corporations friendly to him to acquire media outlets and other industrial concerns across the nation, particularly those previously owned by liberals or Jews. He built powerful alliances with industry; one corporate ally got the lucrative contract worth millions to build the first large-scale detention center for enemies of the state. Soon more would follow. Industry flourished.\n\nBut after an interval of peace following the terrorist attack, voices of dissent again arose within and without the government. Students had started an active program opposing him (known as the White Rose Society), and leaders of nearby nations were speaking out against his bellicose rhetoric. He needed a diversion, something to direct people away from the corporate cronyism being exposed in his own government, and away from questions of his illegitimate rise to power.\n\nTo deal with those who dissented from his policies, at the advice of his politically savvy advisors, he and his handmaidens in the press began a campaign to equate him and his policies with patriotism and the nation itself. National unity was essential, they said, to ensure that the terrorists or their sponsors didn't think they'd succeeded in splitting the nation or weakening its will.\n\nIn times of war, they said, there could be only \"one people, one nation, and one commander-in-chief\" (\"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein F\u00fchrer\"), and so his advocates in the media began a nationwide campaign charging that critics of his policies were attacking the nation itself.\n\nHitler and his friends in the right-wing press repeatedly told the people that the majority, the \u201csilent majority\u201d of good Germans, hated the leftists.\n\nThose questioning him were labeled \u201ccommunists,\u201d \"anti-German\" or \"not good Germans,\" and it was suggested they were aiding the enemies of the state by failing in the patriotic necessity of supporting the nation's valiant men in uniform. It was one of his most effective ways to stifle dissent and pit wage-earning people (from whom most of the police and army came) against the \"intellectuals and liberals\" who were critical of his policies.\n\nHe spoke openly of his \u201clove\u201d for police and the military, and they in turn embraced him with fervor, redoubling the violence they wrought against peaceful protestors.\n\nHitler\u2019s rise to power was largely on the backs of the labor and communist movements. They were his \u201cenemies\u201d first and foremost (although anti-Semitism had been part of his shtick from the beginning: his main attack was that the labor and communist movements were filled with Jews). And he largely destroyed them when he successfully sold the German people on the idea that the \"left\u201d was responsible for burning down the Parliament building, the 9/11 event of that day.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt in my mind, having lived through the era of COINTELPRO and the Patriot Act, that somewhere out there is a person who\u2019s planning to commit an act of terrorism. It may be a dedicated but deluded left-winger, or more likely, a right-winger hoping to stir things up by pretending to be a left-winger. And Trump and his friendly \u201cnews\u201d outlets are ready to use it.\n\nPerhaps apocryphally, Mark Twain once noted that, \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it rhymes.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of examples of that rhyme, and given all the \u201cmainstream\u201d press now being thrown at the Antifa movement, it\u2019s a sure thing that they\u2019re going to be the administration\u2019s and the media\u2019s next big boogeyman.\n\nSomewhere out there is the next Marinus van der Lubbe, and Trump and his press are ready."}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollh%C3%A4ttan_school_attack": {"title": "Trollh\u00e4ttan school attack - Wikipedia", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollh%C3%A4ttan_school_attack", "text": "On 22 October 2015, 21-year-old Anton Lundin Pettersson attacked Kronan School in Trollh\u00e4ttan, Sweden, with a sword. He killed a teaching assistant and a male student, stabbed another male student and a teacher, and died later of the gunshot wounds he received during his apprehension.[1][2] The second teacher who was wounded died in hospital six weeks after the attack, on 3 December.\n\nThe attack was Sweden's first deadly attack on a school since the 1961 Kung\u00e4lv school shooting when one person was killed and six injured. It is also the deadliest attack on a school in Swedish history.[2] The initial police investigation concluded that Pettersson was motivated by racism and had chosen the school as his target due to its location in a neighbourhood with a high immigrant population.[3]\n\nAccording to Professor Ove Sernhede of the University of Gothenburg, Trollh\u00e4ttan had had a long history of hate crimes, starting with arson at a mosque in the 1990s. Research by his colleague Anders Sundell has found it to be the most ethnically segregated city in Sweden.[3]\n\nSurveys frequently show Sweden to be the European country which is most tolerant of immigration, although its population is polarised on the issue. Sundell's research showed that consistently over the last 20 years, a plurality of Swedes had wanted to limit the number of refugees coming to the country, but \"There is a large difference between what the politicians think and the general public, and the media have not questioned the politicians until recently\". This has led to those who oppose immigration to imagine that there is a conspiracy.[3]\n\nPettersson entered the school in a German WW2 helmet and a mask similar to that of Star Wars villain Darth Vader. At first, eyewitnesses believed it was a Halloween prank.[4] Pettersson immediately attacked the 20-year-old teaching assistant Lavin Eskandar. Eskandar, a Feyli Kurd from Iraq,[5][6][7][8] was stabbed and died at the scene. Pettersson then stabbed the abdomen of Ahmed Hassan, a 15-year-old born in Somalia.[3] Hassan died in the hospital. After that Pettersson posed with two students who thought it was a prank and a picture was taken while blood was dripping from the sword. When the 42-year-old teacher Nazir Amso asked Pettersson to remove his mask, Amso was stabbed. He died six weeks later at the hospital. At 10.16 AM Pettersson was shot by police and died in the hospital.[2]\n\nOn the morning of 23 October, Swedish police and media confirmed that the motive behind the attack had \"racist motives\" and that it was a \"hate crime\".[9] Niclas Hallgren, the city's police chief, stated that all of the victims were \"dark-skinned\".[3] Head of investigation Thord Haraldsson said that CCTV footage showed that Pettersson spared the lives of students with white skin.[10]\n\nNazir Amso, the mathematics teacher who was stabbed, died of his injuries in hospital on 3 December, at the age of 42.[11][12]\n\nAnton Niclas Lundin Pettersson[13] (22 June 1994[13] \u2013 22 October 2015) was identified as the attacker at 20:00 CET (18:00 GMT) by Expressen.[14] According to Aftonbladet, the perpetrator had visited right-wing extremist groups at social media sites supporting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.[15] He had also joined a group on Facebook that wants to stop immigration to Sweden.[15] The Swedish Security Service were called in to investigate these findings.[15] Pettersson had no criminal record and was not a member of any political organisation, but had supported a petition by the Sweden Democrats to initiate a referendum on immigration.[3] He left a handwritten note at his home in which he declared that something had to be done about immigration, and that he did not expect to survive his spree.[10]\n\nPettersson graduated from Lichron Teknikgymnasium with a diploma in technology.[10] He lived in an apartment in the neighbourhood of Stavre, but chose to attack the Kronan School in Kronog\u00e5rden, where there are more immigrants; police cited this as more evidence towards his motive.[3] Former classmates described the perpetrator as a lonely person who \"lived in his own world\" and always dressed in black clothes influenced either by the emo or rock scene.[15]\n\nBj\u00f8rn Ihler, a survivor of Norwegian far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik's terror attacks in 2011, wrote in The Guardian that in 2013, Pettersson had \"liked\" a YouTube video of former Ku Klux Klan leader Johnny Lee Clary testifying how a positive experience with a black man had caused him to disavow his previously-held beliefs.[16]\n\nPrime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven travelled to Trollh\u00e4ttan after news of the attack, calling it a \"black day\" for the country.[2] Interior Minister Anders Ygeman wrote on Twitter, \"It is with sadness and dismay I received the news of the attack on the school in Trollh\u00e4ttan. My thoughts go to the victims and their families\".[2] King Carl XVI Gustaf said that the royal family received the news \"with great dismay and sadness\".[17]\n\nIn the days following the attack, there were reports of people wearing suspicious outfits or brandishing weapons, which were discovered to be people celebrating Halloween. The police warned the public not to carry imitation weapons with their Halloween costumes, in order to avoid potentially dangerous misunderstandings.[18]\n\nThe school remained closed until 2 November, when it reopened with higher security. An Afghan father told The Local that he wished to leave the neighbourhood for his family's safety.[19]\n\nOn 29 September 2017, the first book about the school attack was published: \"Det som aldrig fick ske\". The book contains completely new facts, for example a secret suicide note that the police and the Pettersson family didn't know existed.

Despite the professed determination of the G20 group of leading economies to tackle tax secrecy, investors in scores of countries \u2013 including the US and the UK \u2013 are still able to hide some or all of their assets from the taxman.\n\n\"This offshore economy is large enough to have a major impact on estimates of inequality of wealth and income; on estimates of national income and debt ratios; and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 to have very significant negative impacts on the domestic tax bases of 'source' countries,\" Henry says.\n\nUsing the BIS's measure of \"offshore deposits\" \u2013 cash held outside the depositor's home country \u2013 and scaling it up according to the proportion of their portfolio large investors usually hold in cash, he estimates that between $21tn (\u00a313tn) and $32tn (\u00a320tn) in financial assets has been hidden from the world's tax authorities.\n\n\"These estimates reveal a staggering failure,\" says John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network. \"Inequality is much, much worse than official statistics show, but politicians are still relying on trickle-down to transfer wealth to poorer people.\n\n\"This new data shows the exact opposite has happened: for three decades extraordinary wealth has been cascading into the offshore accounts of a tiny number of super-rich.\"\n\nIn total, 10 million individuals around the world hold assets offshore, according to Henry's analysis; but almost half of the minimum estimate of $21tn \u2013 $9.8tn \u2013 is owned by just 92,000 people. And that does not include the non-financial assets \u2013 art, yachts, mansions in Kensington \u2013 that many of the world's movers and shakers like to use as homes for their immense riches.\n\n\"If we could figure out how to tax all this offshore wealth without killing the proverbial golden goose, or at least entice its owners to reinvest it back home, this sector of the global underground is easily large enough to make a significant contribution to tax justice, investment and paying the costs of global problems like climate change,\" Henry says.\n\nHe corroborates his findings by using national accounts to assemble estimates of the cumulative capital flight from more than 130 low- to middle-income countries over almost 40 years, and the returns their wealthy owners are likely to have made from them.\n\nIn many cases, , the total worth of these assets far exceeds the value of the overseas debts of the countries they came from.\n\nThe struggles of the authorities in Egypt to recover the vast sums hidden abroad by Hosni Mubarak, his family and other cronies during his many years in power have provided a striking recent example of the fact that kleptocratic rulers can use their time to amass immense fortunes while many of their citizens are trapped in poverty.\n\nThe world's poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have fought long and hard in recent years to receive debt forgiveness from the international community; but this research suggests that in many cases, if they had been able to draw their richest citizens into the tax net, they could have avoided being dragged into indebtedness in the first place. Oil-rich Nigeria has seen more than $300bn spirited away since 1970, for example, while Ivory Coast has lost $141bn.\n\nAssuming that super-rich investors earn a relatively modest 3% a year on their $21tn, taxing that vast wall of money at 30% would generate a very useful $189bn a year \u2013 more than rich economies spend on aid to the rest of the world.\n\nThe sheer scale of the hidden assets held by the super-rich also suggests that standard measures of inequality, which tend to rely on surveys of household income or wealth in individual countries, radically underestimate the true gap between rich and poor.\n\nMilorad Kovacevic, chief statistician of the UN Development Programme's Human Development Report, says both the very wealthy and the very poor tend to be excluded from mainstream calculations of inequality.\n\n\"People that are in charge of measuring inequality based on survey data know that the both ends of the distribution are underrepresented \u2013 or, even better, misrepresented,\" he says.\n\n\"There is rarely a household from the top 1% earners that participates in the survey. On the other side, the poor people either don't have addresses to be selected into the sample, or when selected they misquote their earnings \u2013 usually biasing them upwards.\"\n\nInequality is widely seen as having increased sharply in many developed countries over the past decade or more \u2013 as described in a recent paper from the IMF, which showed marked increases in the so-called Gini coefficient, which economists use to measure how evenly income is shared across societies.\n\nGlobalisation has exposed low-skilled workers to competition from cheap economies such as China, while the surging profitability of the financial services industry \u2013 and the spread of the big bonus culture before the credit crunch \u2013 led to what economists have called a \"racing away\" at the top of the income scale.\n\nHowever, Henry's research suggests that this acknowledged jump in inequality is a dramatic underestimate. Stewart Lansley, author of the recent book The Cost of Inequality, says: \"There is absolutely no doubt at all that the statistics on income and wealth at the top understate the problem.\"\n\nThe surveys that are used to compile the Gini coefficient \"simply don't touch the super-rich,\" he says. \"You don't pick up the multimillionaires and billionaires, and even if you do, you can't pick it up properly.\"\n\nIn fact, some experts believe the amount of assets being held offshore is so large that accounting for it fully would radically alter the balance of financial power between countries. The French economist Thomas Piketty, an expert on inequality who helps compile the World Top Incomes Database, says research by his colleagues has shown that \"the wealth held in tax havens is probably sufficiently substantial to turn Europe into a very large net creditor with respect to the rest of the world.\"\n\nIn other words, even a solution to the eurozone's seemingly endless sovereign debt crisis might be within reach \u2013 if only Europe's governments could get a grip on the wallets of their own wealthiest citizens.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 23 July.

Far more common are systems of social democracy, now often referred to as \u2018democratic socialism\u2019, in which extensive state regulation, with limited state ownership, has been employed by democratically elected governments (as in Sweden and Denmark) in the belief that it produces a fair distribution of income without impairing economic growth.\u201d\n\nSocialism is not the dictionary\u2019s word of the year, though \u2013 that honour goes for the first time to a suffix, \u201cism\u201d, reflecting the fact that many of Merriam-Webster\u2019s most-looked-up words in 2015 ended in \u201cism\u201d.

They are covered in motor oil. Their hair, black and oily, stands on end. Near them is a group of drivers. Abu Fawzi is at the centre, conspicuous in his bright red jacket. It matches the colour of his beloved 18-wheeler. He\u2019s clearly the leader, quick to offer tea and cigarettes. At first he says he doesn\u2019t want to speak but soon changes his mind. He and the rest of the drivers are angry. It\u2019s weeks since they risked their lives for a journey that ruined engines and broke axles but still they haven\u2019t been paid. It was a journey to hell and back, he says.\n\n\u201cWe were scared from the moment we entered Raqqa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were supposed to go in with the SDF, but we went alone. As soon as we entered, we saw IS fighters with their weapons and suicide belts on. They booby-trapped our trucks. If something were to go wrong in the deal, they would bomb the entire convoy. Even their children and women had suicide belts on.\u201d The Kurdish-led SDF cleared Raqqa of media. Islamic State\u2019s escape from its base would not be televised. Publicly, the SDF said that only a few dozen fighters had been able to leave, all of them locals. But one lorry driver tells us that isn't true.\n\nAnother driver says the convoy was six to seven kilometres long. It included almost 50 trucks, 13 buses and more than 100 of the Islamic State group\u2019s own vehicles. IS fighters, their faces covered, sat defiantly on top of some of the vehicles. Footage secretly filmed and passed to us shows lorries towing trailers crammed with armed men. Despite an agreement to take only personal weapons, IS fighters took everything they could carry. Ten trucks were loaded with weapons and ammunition.\n\nThe drivers point to a white truck being worked on in the corner of the yard. \u201cIts axle was broken because of the weight of the ammo,\u201d says Abu Fawzi. This wasn\u2019t so much an evacuation - it was the exodus of so-called Islamic State. The SDF didn\u2019t want the retreat from Raqqa to look like an escape to victory. No flags or banners would be allowed to be flown from the convoy as it left the city, the deal stipulated. It was also understood that no foreigners would be allowed to leave Raqqa alive. Back in May, US Defence Secretary James Mattis described the fight against IS as a war of \u201cannihilation\u201d.\u201cOur intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to north Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa. We are not going to allow them to do so,\u201d he said on US television. But foreign fighters \u2013 those not from Syria and Iraq - were also able to join the convoy, according to the drivers. One explains:\n\nOther drivers chipped in with the names of different nationalities. In light of the BBC investigation, the coalition now admits the part it played in the deal. Some 250 IS fighters were allowed to leave Raqqa, with 3,500 of their family members. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anyone to leave,\u201d says Col Ryan Dillon, spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, the Western coalition against IS. \u201cBut this goes to the heart of our strategy, \u2018by, with and through\u2019 local leaders on the ground. It comes down to Syrians \u2013 they are the ones fighting and dying, they get to make the decisions regarding operations,\u201d he says. While a Western officer was present for the negotiations, they didn\u2019t take an \u201cactive part\u201d in the discussions. Col Dillon maintains, though, that only four foreign fighters left and they are now in SDF custody.\n\nAs it left the city, the convoy would pass through the well-irrigated cotton and wheat fields north of Raqqa. Small villages gave way to desert. The convoy left the main road and took to tracks across the desert. The trucks found it hard going, but it was much harder for the men behind the wheel. A friend of Abu Fawzi's rolls up the sleeve of his tunic. Underneath, there are burns on his skin. \u201cLook what they did here,\u201d he says. According to Abu Fawzi, there were three or four foreigners with each driver. They would beat him and call him names, such as \u201cinfidel\u201d, or \u201cpig\u201d. They might have been helping the fighters escape, but the Arab drivers were abused the entire route, they say. And threatened. \u201cThey said, 'Let us know when you rebuild Raqqa - we will come back,\u2019\u201d says Abu Fawzi. \u201cThey were defiant and didn\u2019t care.

Within two weeks, I was contemplating suicide.\n\nAfter a month on suicide watch, I was transferred back to US, to a tiny 6 x 8ft (roughly 2 x 2.5 meter) cell in a place that will haunt me for the rest of my life: the US Marine Corps Brig in Quantico, Virginia. I was held there for roughly nine months as a \u201cprevention of injury\u201d prisoner, a designation the Marine Corps and the Navy used to place me in highly restrictive solitary conditions without a psychiatrist\u2019s approval.\n\nFor 17 hours a day, I sat directly in front of at least two Marine Corps guards seated behind a one-way mirror. I was not allowed to lay down. I was not allowed to lean my back against the cell wall. I was not allowed to exercise. Sometimes, to keep from going crazy, I would stand up, walk around, or dance, as \u201cdancing\u201d was not considered exercise by the Marine Corps.\n\nTo pass the time, I counted the hundreds of holes between the steel bars in a grid pattern at the front of my empty cell. My eyes traced the gaps between the bricks on the wall. I looked at the rough patterns and stains on the concrete floor \u2013 including one that looked like a caricature grey alien, with large black eyes and no mouth, that was popular in the 1990s. I could hear the \u201cdrip drop drip\u201d of a leaky pipe somewhere down the hall. I listened to the faint buzz of the fluorescent lights.\n\nFor brief periods, every other day or so, I was escorted by a team of at least three guards to an empty basketball court-sized area. There, I was shackled and walked around in circles or figure-eights for 20 minutes. I was not allowed to stand still, otherwise they would take me back to my cell.\n\nI was only allowed a couple of hours of visitation each month to see my friends, family and lawyers, through a thick glass partition in a tiny 4 x 6ft room. My hands and feet were shackled the entire time. Federal agents installed recording equipment specifically to monitor my conversations, except with my lawyers.\n\nThe United Nations special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, condemned my treatment as \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\u201d, describing \u201cthe excessive and prolonged isolation\u201d I was placed under for that period of time. However, he didn\u2019t stop there. In a preface to the 2014 Spanish edition of the Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement, written by M\u00e9ndez he strongly recommends against any use of solitary confinement beyond 15 days.\n\nUnfortunately, conditions similar to the ones I experienced in 2010-11 are hardly unusual for the estimated 80,000 to 100,000 inmates held in these conditions across the US every day.\n\nIn the time since my confinement at Quantico, public awareness of solitary confinement has improved by orders of magnitude. People all across the political spectrum \u2013 including some who have never been in solitary or known anyone who has \u2013 are now beginning to question whether this practice is a moral and ethical one. In June 2015, US supreme court justice Anthony Kennedy called the prison system \u201coverlooked\u201d and \u201cmisunderstood\u201d, stating that he welcomes a case that would allow the court to review whether or not solitary confinement is cruel and unusual under the US constitution.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming that it should be deemed as such: solitary confinement in the US is arbitrary, abused and unnecessary in many situations. It is cruel, degrading and inhumane, and is effectively a \u201cno touch\u201d torture. We should end the practice quickly and completely."}, "http://www.onepeterfive.com/pope-communists-think-like-christians/": {"title": "Pope: \"It is the Communists Who Think Like Christians\"", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.onepeterfive.com/pope-communists-think-like-christians/", "text": "During this week where Americans have been distracted by the unexpected upset of a presidential election that could very well change the course of our collective future, Pope Francis has been busy making political statements of his own.\n\nIn yet another interview with Eugenio Scalfari (see our standard rebuttal to \u201cyou can\u2019t trust Scalfari!\u201d here), this exchange was reported to have taken place:\n\nYou told me some time ago that the precept, \u201cLove your neighbour as thyself\u201d had to change, given the dark times that we are going through, and become \u201cmore than thyself.\u201d So you yearn for a society where equality dominates. This, as you know, is the programme of Marxist socialism and then of communism. Are you therefore thinking of a Marxist type of society? \u201cIt it has been said many times and my response has always been that, if anything, it is the communists who think like Christians. Christ spoke of a society where the poor, the weak and the marginalized have the right to decide. Not demagogues, not Barabbas, but the people, the poor, whether they have faith in a transcendent God or not. It is they who must help to achieve equality and freedom\u201d. [emphasis added]\n\nOne of the most hotly contested criticism of Pope Francis is that he is ideologically aligned with Marxists. We\u2019ve covered some of the connections before, so I won\u2019t rehash them here. What seems fair to say is that this is the most direct admission yet that Francis identifies his program of social justice as something compatible with Communism \u2013 itself an intrinsic evil.\n\nOf course, this seems all of a piece. On the eve of the US Presidential election \u2014 which featured the most pro-abortion candidate for the presidency in this nation\u2019s history \u2014 Francis was busy meeting with his friend Emma Bonino, Italy\u2019s most famous and prolific abortionist. They got together to talk about the migrant crisis, something so close to his heart that he not only overlooks Bonino\u2019s crimes and calls her one of Italy\u2019s \u201cgreats\u201d, he also used it to take a swipe at then presidential candidate (now president-elect) Donald Trump, saying:\n\nWhen Francis was asked directly by Scalfari what he thinks of Trump, he responded:\n\nToday, the theme of migration arose yet again, as it was reported that Francis will infuse a refugee theme into the Vatican\u2019s nativity display:\n\nOn matters that should, it seems, be at least as close to the heart of the pope as the plight of refugees, there have instead been bizarre developments over the past few days. Jan Bentz of LifeSiteNews reports that under new papally-approved statutes, members of the Pontifical Academy for Life \u201cwill no longer be required to sign a declaration that they uphold the Church\u2019s pro-life teachings.\u201d The Academy is also expanding its focus to protection of the environment.\n\n\u201cThe Academy has a task of a prevalently scientific nature, directed towards the promotion and defense of human life (cf. Vitae Mysterium, 4). In particular, it studies the various aspects that relate to the care of the dignity of the human person at the different ages of existence, mutual respect between genders and generations, the defense of the dignity of each single human being, the promotion of a quality of human life that integrates material and spiritual value, with a view to an authentic \u2018human ecology\u2019, which may help to recover the original balance of Creation between the human person and the entire universe (cf. Chirograph, 15 August 2016).\u201d\n\nThe surprise is the inclusion of the word \u201cgender\u201d instead of the more specific and less loaded word \u201csex,\u201d as well as the consideration of the quality of a human life in a dependent relation with the \u201centire universe.\u201d This leaves the door open to all kinds of modern trends, such as elevating animal life to equal standing with human life, or putting the idea of a sociological gender before the natural sex of a person. At the same time, the ambiguous \u201coriginal balance of Creation\u201d is introduced, which needs further theological exposition in order not to be mistaken for a pagan idea of the cosmos.\n\nAnd in a new interview included in a book that collects Francis homilies and addresses from his time as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1999 to 2013, Francis\u2019 views on the Mass are brought to light:\n\nThe question of how closely Francis aligns himself with Communist ideology will no doubt continue to be debated. His priorities as the leader of the Catholic Church, however, have become increasingly clear."}, "http://www.thestranger.com/news/2017/10/04/25451102/we-snuck-into-seattles-super-secret-white-nationalist-convention": {"title": "We Snuck into Seattle's Super Secret White Nationalist Convention", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.thestranger.com/news/2017/10/04/25451102/we-snuck-into-seattles-super-secret-white-nationalist-convention", "text": "Back in January, I e-mailed Dr. Greg Johnson, organizer of Northwest Forum, Seattle\u2019s hottest closed-door white nationalist convention, asking for an interview on the latest in regional racism. He turned me down. Thanks to the internet, the far right no longer needs the mainstream media to get its message out. Print, television, and radio lose their relevance when everybody\u2019s just a click away from Pepe the Frog, Disney songs dubbed with racist lyrics, and pseudo-intellectual essays that somehow try to bring ancient Rome into all this.\n\nAlso thanks to the internet, it only took me about an hour to change my identity from David Lewis, Seattle historian, to Dave Lewis, Neo-Nazi film editor and aspiring book critic from Charlottesville, currently living in Los Angeles. This Dave Lewis has never been to Seattle, but has always wanted to attend Northwest Forum.\n\nMy film editor persona dangled a giant chunk of cheese in front of Dr. Johnson. In addition to being a racist, Johnson is also a huge cinephile who has published two books of \u201cpro-white\u201d movie reviews wherein he rants against Zootopia as \u201cpure evil\u201d but surprisingly enjoyed 8 Mile. The role of film editor also worked to my advantage because, despite a recent fundraising spike, the white nationalist movement still has a hard time attracting people with artistic or technical talent.\n\nDr. Johnson bit the cheese. Entry into Northwest Forum typically requires \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d which means meeting in person and getting a beer with one of the Northwest\u2019s white separatist organizations like True Cascadia. But I didn\u2019t even have to send in a photo after mentioning that, as a Charlottesville native (actually from Ballard), I was writing an essay titled Tear Down Lee and Put Up Lincoln: Abraham Lincoln, World\u2019s Greatest White Nationalist. The essay actually wasn\u2019t as far-fetched as it sounds. One of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s main objections to slavery was that it led to miscegenation, and he believed in deporting all the freed slaves to Haiti or Liberia as soon as the war was over. As the abolitionist Frederick Douglas put it, African-Americans were \u201cat best only his stepchildren.\u201d\n\nMy e-mail invite listed the forum for August 26th at noon, the same day Black Lives Matter activists planned a march to Lake View Cemetery to protest the Confederate Civil War memorial. Only the stated location aroused my suspicions, since the invite said we would be meeting at the Queen Anne Public Library, and policy dictates that library events have to be open to the public. A white nationalist convention definitely wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you\u2019d want Joe Seattle to stumble in on after he finishes pirating CDs onto his laptop. Nevertheless, as I got closer to the library, I noticed several young white dudes sporting the \u201cfashy\u201d haircut, previously known as a \u201cMacklemore.\u201d A lookout Nazi in a white polo shirt stood on the front lawn, twirling his curly tech-dick mustache. He noticed my white polo, which like the \u201cMacklemore,\u201d is now associated with white nationalism. Just to scrub out any doubt, I was also carrying a copy of the 1958 Neo-Nazi classic The Lightning and the Sun. \u201cAre you here for the thing?\u201d He asked. They were really going all out on the secret agent stuff. I nodded and he pointed me across the street to an early-20th century Masonic Lodge with dozens of other white nationalists heading through the doorway. Dr. Johnson said he told the Masons this was a writers group.\n\nOriginally built by the telephone company in 1900, the lodge was refurbished by the Masons in 1927. Upon entering, a woman who looked like a grizzled waitress from a black and white movie hit me up for a $40 admission fee (not mentioned in my invitation). Women, it turns out, are only slightly more common than black people at white nationalist conventions.\n\nOf the 70 to 80 people in the lodge, only about four were female. By far the one who creeped me out the most was a five-year-old girl in white dress clomping around in pink boots with her blond hair in a pink ribbon who played Beethoven on the piano. When she walked by in her white dress eating a white Top Pot donut, the fawning look of admiration she received from Dr. Johnson seeing the next generation of white supremacy made my jaw drop. One of my new friends noticed the look on my face:\n\nVirtually every time I use the word \u201cNazi\u201d I\u2019m using it as an insult. In the world of millennial white nationalism, there aren't a ton of people who actually self-identify as Nazis. Despite usually agreeing with everything the Nazis did and believing the Holocaust is just \u201canti-white propaganda,\u201d they always claim a technical reason for why they aren\u2019t \u201cNational Socialists.\u201d None of these reasons would ever make sense to anybody outside the community and \u201cI\u2019m not a Nazi, but\u201d is one of the most common white nationalist recruitment tricks to have people hear them out.\n\nWhite nationalists generally don\u2019t want to look like characters out of American History X anymore. Fashion choices at the convention ranged from Ruby Ridge to Mad Men, but most of the people there looked like you might run into them on Capitol Hill or in the U-District. That said, there is a type. According to my observations, the standard Seattle Nazi is a white male under 30 who either works in the tech industry or is going to school to work in the tech industry. \u201cYou\u2019re also a coder? Do you mind if I send you something I\u2019ve been working on?\u201d I heard that more than once.\n\nNobody at the convention looked less like a Nazi than organizer Greg Johnson in his sports coat and open-collared shirt. Before the forum I didn\u2019t even know what the former philosophy professor Dr. Johnson looked like, as he is extremely good at keeping pictures of himself off the internet. Before an undercover Swedish activist working for Hope Not Hate secretly filmed him as part of a yearlong investigation into international white nationalism, the only picture of Johnson anywhere on the internet was a heavily blown up photo of him from his professor days on a Neo-Nazi website accusing him of being gay, calling him \u201cGrinder Greg Johnson.\u201d (The owner of the website is apparently unaware that Grindr is spelled without an \u201ce\u201d.) Whether he is actually gay and whether that\u2019s an issue are among the more divisive questions in the white nationalist community.\n\nWhen not fighting for the white ethno-state, Dr. Johnson lives an extremely NPR lifestyle filled with world travel, visits to art galleries, and opera. Talking to him, his college philosophy professor background comes out. He even recommended a better translation of Giambattista Vico\u2019s New Science to me, and discussed Vico\u2019s influence on James Joyce. If not for sprinkles of racial and anti-semitic slurs, he looks and acts exactly like someone you would run into at the Hugo House. While most white nationalists think Johnson keeps his identity secret because they think he is gay, he probably just doesn\u2019t want to be recognized during intermission at the Seattle Symphony.\n\nPeople attend the forum to meet the visiting blue chip racists that Dr. Johnson flies in. Notable guests have included Identity Evropa founder Nathan Damigo and anti-semitic professor Kevin MacDonald. The forum I attended featured Jared Taylor, founder and editor of the online white nationalist magazine American Renaissance, fresh from his VICE interview with Eddie Huang. One of the world\u2019s leading advocates for scientific racism, Taylor is unique among white nationalists in that he believes East Asians to be objectively superior to whites. He signed some copies of his books in Japanese, having grown up in Japan to missionary parents and developing fluency in the language.\n\nVisiting speakers have been surprised by the turn out in Seattle. Taylor told me that the meeting was actually bigger than similar events he has attended around the country. In a podcast following an earlier forum, Kevin MacDonald said he was impressed by both the turn out and superior quality of the attendees. Originally, Dr. Johnson planned on having a forum in Seattle on the even-numbered months and a forum in New York City on the odd-numbed months, but recently decided he might pull the NYC forum because it is much harder to fill a venue in New York than in Seattle, despite the Big Apple having almost 8 million more people. The surprising number of racists in liberal cities first occurred to Johnson years ago. He was working for a \u201chighbrow\u201d white nationalist magazine and noticed that many of their readers lived close to one another without knowing they had neighbors who shared their racist interests. Johnson set out to bring these people together in private. Seattleites, even the ones who love Hitler, hate confrontation.\n\nSpeaking of Hitler, while at the bar getting coffee and Top Pot donuts, I noticed Seattle\u2019s Hitler tea-pot guy, Charles Krafft, stood right behind me. In 2013, the art critic Jen Graves revealed in The Stranger that Krafft\u2019s Nazi-inspired ceramic art might not be ironic. While Krafft does not identify as a \u201cNational Socialist\u201d or believe his work to be pro-Nazi (he also does teapots of Kim Jong Il, Charles Manson, and Amy Winehouse), he is also a Holocaust denier who puts stock in conspiracy theories about elaborate plans for Jews to control the world. So the short answer is he is a white nationalist. As a result of his views, art shows that would formerly have been honored to have Krafft 86ed him, including one in London that cancelled on him right before the convention. What cred he\u2019s lost in the art community he has more than recovered among white nationalists. He has become a staple at Northwest Forum, known for holding before-parties at his house, which he rents from a Chinese-American landlord.\n\nUnlike Dr. Johnson, Krafft has no problem openly giving interviews about northwest white nationalism. I\u2019d spoken with Krafft for a podcast two years earlier, so he was the only person at the forum who could possibly identify me. My first thought upon seeing him was how I had to stay as far away from him as possible, but my second thought was how much white nationalism has changed in the Northwest since two years ago.\n\nWhen I\u2019d asked Krafft back in 2015 how many white nationalists resided in Seattle, he responded \u201cnot many.\u201d The only local voice for white separatism was the laughably uncharismatic Harold Covington of Northwest Front, who according to Krafft, asks people for money immediately upon meeting them. Surprisingly, some white nationalist circles now hold Harold Covington in high regard. That's especially true among younger followers (including the church shooter Dylann Roof). His \u201cracially aware\u201d Northwest sci-fi novels are required reading among convention attendees. Some have read all of them. To prep for the forum, I planned on reading Covington's best-known works. I started with a young adult novel about a delinquent and his cheerleader girlfriend in the Seattle race war, but gave up after forty pages because the book is unreadable.\n\nEnough mingling! It was time for the speeches on the second floor. Dr. Johnson announced that everything we were about to hear was totally off the record and not to be shared with anybody outside our circle of racists. Did this mean I would have to turn off the tape recorder that had been running in my backpack for the last 3 hours? Better not ask.\n\nThe first speaker to come up was Taylor (who during the break had performed a stunning act by using the ladies\u2019 room after all the bullshit I\u2019d been listening to about how gender-neutral bathrooms are destroying America. Though, to be fair, having a ladies\u2019 room at an event like this is superfluous anyway). Unfortunately, the super-secret, closed-door Nazi plan didn\u2019t turn out to be nearly as titillating as you\u2019d want. Speakers encouraged followers to take the Gandhi approach and continue getting punched in the face a la Richard Spencer. The media will have no choice but to turn to its side, their reasoning went. Taylor, Dr. Johnson, and the other speakers are all pretty married to this strategy. They also disapprove of their followers using ethnic slurs in public because it gives the media soundbites to latch onto.\n\nMuch bleaker is Dr. Johnson\u2019s Seattle-suitable, \u201csecret agent\u201d racism plan. Basically, white nationalists meet in secret at conventions like Northwest Forum while paying \u201clip service to diversity\u201d at their day jobs. They move into positions of power where they can hire other racists and keep non-whites from getting into the company. Two years ago, this method would have seemed like a total joke, but these guys really do mostly work in tech, and they were doing a lot of networking. When talking about the people he has counseled on the \u201csecret agent\u201d method, Dr. Johnson has written that they include \u201ccollege professors, writers, artists, designers, publishers, creative people working in the film industry, businessmen, and professionals, some of them quite prominent in their fields.\u201d When I told Dr. Johnson I was reluctant to use my super film editing skills (I can\u2019t even work iMovie) for the movement because I was afraid I would be outed in Hollywood he said, \u201cYou know, you can always be a secret agent, there's no shame in that.\u201d\n\nI was never more aware that I was dealing with Seattle racists than when it came time for questions and people were asking the same kind of self-righteous, rambling, statement-questions you encounter at Town Hall. One of the questions came from an East Indian-Canadian. I don\u2019t remember what he asked because I was too busy sharing confused looks with the Neo-Nazis. Right guys? WTF?\n\nAt the break, I asked the questioner if being brown-skinned ever interferes with being a white separatist. It led to a lengthy conversation that made no sense, and I was glad when the break ended to get back to the speeches.\n\nWithout checking my recording, I wouldn't even have been able to remember who the other speakers at the forum were or what they said. It was actually kind of a letdown, and by the time the convention ended, the voyeuristic novelty of sneaking into a Nazi meeting had worn off. I was just bored in a Masonic Hall on Queen Anne. My interest picked up when Dr. Johnson, seated on a Masonic throne, announced that we would all be going to dinner at Buca di Beppo. When I called one of my emergency contact friends about the change of location she said, \u201cBuca di Beppo? Do Nazis need to carbo load?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d reserved two large tables and a smaller one for the duds. Showing up late, I got stuck at the dud table along with the Wise Old Man, a 91-year-old Holocaust denier who went to Hollywood back in 1952 for a songwriting career. When that didn\u2019t work out, he started waving anti-Israel signs at the Oscars for the next 40 years. Krafft was really wowed by him, but nobody else cared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d the Wise Old Man said. \u201cYou\u2019re young\u2026 can I borrow your coat?\u201d\n\n\u201c... Yeah\u2026 I guess.\u201d I took off my cardigan and handed it to him. Ewwww gross. He\u2019s tucking it into his pants. Without my cardigan, the air conditioning was freezing and made my nipples stick out on my white polo. I hated being a Nazi then more than ever. It also made me super uncomfortable having a black guy refill our water glasses, because it was like we were suddenly in The Man in the High Castle.\n\n\u201cThat movie Hidden Figures was bullshit,\u201d a guy dressed like John Goodman in The Big Lebowski said out of nowhere. \u201cWe never went to the moon, Stanley Kubrick faked all of it.\u201d Water almost squirted out of my nose and it was the closest I came all night to breaking character.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to run me through this,\u201d I said, not being familiar with this particular theory.\n\nAfter explaining the theory, he added, \u201cAnd if you think that\u2019s nonsense you should look into the Holocaust. This is science.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was raised Christian Scientist,\u201d the Wise Old Man chimed in. \u201cMust be the reason I\u2019m so healthy now.\u201d The best I can figure is he heard the word \u201cscience\u201d at the end of the sentence and his mind went from there. He amused me in the same way the little blonde Nazi-tot at the other table creeped me out. John Goodman then continued with a whole range of conspiracy theories from Waco, to the Bible, to how TV broadcasts were designed to give him anger issues.\n\nUnfortunately, the table I sat at was not the norm. What I could overhear from the other conversations consisted of coding, Game of Thrones, Tolkien, how Rashomon relates to cultural relativism, etc. The sorts of things regular white people talk about at similar gatherings. For a second, I got a vision of what Seattle would be like with zero ethnic diversity: It would be dull, like being at one of those bougie, middle-aged white person parties minus the talk about which countries their kids are teaching English in.\n\nFrom a clinical viewpoint, I was sort of impressed by Dr. Johnson\u2019s recruitment approach. Former skinhead movements fizzled out because, in addition to requiring fanatical racism from their followers, they also required severe lifestyle changes like going off to live in survivalist compounds or being a Nazi 24/7. The Johnson Seattle approach to racism is more like, \u201clet\u2019s get a cake for Hitler\u2019s birthday after picking the kids up from soccer practice,\u201d making it more compatible with the way a lot of these people already live and the way they grew up.\n\nTwenty minutes after we finished eating, it was time to go and the Wise Old Man looked around confused. \u201cWhen is the food coming?\u201d He can remember all kinds of Zionist conspiracies, but he can\u2019t remember that he ate 15 minutes ago. By sitting at the table with him, I had missed out on all kinds of invaluable far-rightwing gossip blurted at Dr. Johnson\u2019s table. By the time I got there, most of the blue chip guests had left and Johnson was sitting alone with the ticket woman, doodling flowers and smiley faces on his paper menu. We made plans to meet for coffee or lunch the next day, but when the location was changed to Charles Krafft\u2019s house, I made up the excuse that I was going to Wild Waves that day.\n\nAt the time, I didn't realize I wasn\u2019t the only undercover reporter at Northwest Forum. At the June forum they\u2019d let in a much better looking, better funded, Antifa activist all the way from Sweden, equipped with James Bond-quality cameras and sound equipment.\n\nOriginally, I\u2019d gotten into this because I\u2019m working on a Seattle history book and wanted a chapter on Northwest racism. It definitely did not occur to me that a local news story about white nationalists who want to take over America but can\u2019t screen out reporters would have international appeal. Nevertheless, Greg Johnson became the top story in the New York Times when the paper revealed that the Swedish spy had actually filmed him, the only thing in the Northwest harder to get on camera than Bigfoot. Dr. Johnson actually has a WAY bigger following all over the world than I ever would have thought. In the two years since I\u2019d interviewed Charles Krafft, Seattle had somehow gone from virtually no open racists (although I\u2019ve worked retail at places with pretty open whites only management policies) to being the kind of place to which you\u2019d travel all the way from Sweden to study a new style of racism. The city\u2019s really changing."}, "https://socialistworker.org/2016/08/22/standing-up-at-standing-rock": {"title": "Standing up at Standing Rock", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://socialistworker.org/2016/08/22/standing-up-at-standing-rock", "text": "SOME 1,000 Native American activists from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and across the country faced off against police and security forces protecting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline project. Dozens of people have been arrested and assaulted by police while attempting to stop the project, and many more continue to risk arrest to protest the pipeline.\n\nThe Dakota Access pipeline, which is being built by Energy Transfer Partners, is planned to stretch 1,172 miles from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa, before ending in Illinois.\n\nThe $3.8 billion project was begun in 2014 and is supposed to be completed by the end of the year. Once finished, the pipeline will carry a daily load of 570,000 barrels of oil extracted through hydraulic fracturing. It will cross 209 rivers, creeks and tributaries. Unless, that is, activists have anything to say about it.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (SRST), members of the Hunkpapa Lakota Nation, has been leading the resistance. The current stage of pipeline construction has reached a segment that runs only a half-mile away from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, located in North and South Dakota.\n\nIn response, the Nation has put together a legal and activist challenge to the pipeline.\n\nThe SRST filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which quietly approved the pipeline without proper consultation with the tribe. The SRST says the route of the pipeline--through the Missouri River and Lake Oahe--will disturb tribal burial grounds and affect the Nation's drinking water. In a statement, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said:\n\nIn April, protesters set up a camp--named the Sacred Stone Spiritual Camp--at the Cannonball river, which meets the Missouri River and is the border of the reservation. Jon Eagle Sr., SRST's tribal historic preservation officer, explained the historic and cultural significance of the site:\n\nBefore the protests, 31 Lakota youth from various reservations in North and South Dakota participated in a relay run more than 1,600 miles to Washington, D.C., to hand over a petition condemning the pipeline signed by over 160,000 people.\n\nThe camp has swelled to approximately 1,000 activists, both Native and non-Native, anxious to continue the fight for indigenous sovereignty and environmental justice.\n\nThe protest have been nonviolent, but that hasn't stopped Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier from making absurd claims that the protesters were about to physically destroy the pipeline. \"They were preparing to throw pipe bombs at our line, M80s, fireworks, things of that nature to disrupt us,\" Kirchmeier claimed.\n\nWork on the pipeline was halted on August 19 over what officials claimed were \"safety concerns\" caused by protesters. A judge is currently considering whether to grant an order halting construction while various arguments can be heard in court.\n\nDAVE ARCHAMBAULT II invoked treaty rights in his call to halt the pipeline, stating, \"We don't want this black snake within our Treaty boundaries.\"\n\nIn 1851 and 1868, the Lakota (Sioux) signed the Fort Laramie Treaty with the U.S. government, creating the Great Sioux reservation, which included all of South Dakota west of the Missouri river. The treaty also protected hunting rights in the surrounding area, including where the pipeline is set to go through.\n\nWhile numerous violations of the treaties have displaced the Lakota, there is also a history of resistance--which we are seeing again today with the struggle against the Dakota Access pipeline and the breaking of treaty rights and denial of sovereignty to the Native community.\n\nThe struggle is also a continuation of the successful fight waged by Native activists and environmentalists against the Keystone XL pipeline. Much like that fight, Native Americans are leading the way--but it is has created the opportunity to build a multiracial movement against climate change.\n\nOne resounding message from Native American activists has been the power of solidarity. During the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline, for example, Natives and non-Natives formed the Cowboy-Indian Alliance. Similar coalitions are being forged in the current struggle.\n\nCrow Creek Sioux Tribal Chairman Brandon Sazue explained in a Facebook statement why he and his tribe were offering support:\n\nThis sentiment is widespread in Indian Country. Oglala Sioux Tribal President John Yellow Bird Steele sent supplies and buses of people from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to Cannonball to support the protesters. Currently, over 60 American Indian Nations are represented at the camp.\n\nFarmers in Iowa are also putting up a fight against the pipeline and asking the courts for an injunction against eminent domain proceedings.\n\nThe SRST has been calling on the Obama administration to halt the pipeline. Obama is only the fourth sitting president to make an official visit to an Indian reservation, and he choose to come to the Standing Rock Reservation.\n\nBut Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton have been silent on the issue of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Democratic Party continues to promote an \"all of the above\" energy strategy that includes fracking and the new oil fields in North Dakota. The only presidential candidate who is opposing the Dakota Access pipeline--and all new pipelines--is Green Party nominee Jill Stein.\n\nENEERGY TRANSFER'S Dakota Access LLC recently filed suit against protesters at the site, including SRST Chairman Dave Archambault. The company claims protesters \"have created and will continue to create a risk of bodily injury and harm to Dakota Access employees and contractors, as well as to law enforcement personnel and other individuals at the construction site.\"\n\nA North Dakota federal court recently granted a temporary restraining order against protestors who are interfering with pipeline construction.\n\n But activists say the real threat comes from the pipeline and the environmental damage it will cause, not from the efforts to halt it.\n\nToday, those pushing for the Dakota Access pipeline are steamrolling through Indian treaty land without concern for the earth or the people whose land they are invading.\n\nIt took a strong movement to halt the Keystone XL pipeline. We will need to continue that struggle to halt other pipelines and the system Sitting Bull described and fight for a society that puts people and the planet first over profits."}, "https://www.thenation.com/article/democratic-socialism-is-having-a-very-good-year-at-the-ballot-box/": {"title": "Democratic Socialism Is Having a Very Good Year at the Ballot Box", "keywords": ["Socialism"], "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/democratic-socialism-is-having-a-very-good-year-at-the-ballot-box/", "text": "When Lee Carter realized that he had defeated an entrenched Republican incumbent and been elected to the Virginia House of Delegates on November 7, the 30-year-old Marine veteran claimed his upset victory. Then he did something that\u2019s uncommon in contemporary American politics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a song that comes to mind,\u201d announced the man who had just grabbed a suburban Virginia legislative district away from the Republican Party\u2019s very conservative House majority whip. \u201cThose of you that know, join in!\u201d\n\nFull-throated and enthusiastic as he had been throughout an uphill campaign, the newly elected legislator began:\n\nThe crowd did join in, raising their voices in a celebratory rendering of the workers\u2019 anthem that signaled the arrival of a new politics in Manassas, Virginia.\n\nBut \u201cSolidarity Forever\u201d is an old song, with roots that go back more than a century, to the days when the radical songwriter Ralph Chaplin penned it in response to the labor and political struggles of an era when Eugene Victor Debs and the Socialist Party he led were at the peak of their popularity.\n\nThat historical connection is an important one, since Lee Carter is a democratic socialist who ran with strong support from the growing Democratic Socialists of America movement.\n\nThe Virginian was one of many candidates who were inspired by the 2016 presidential campaign of another democratic socialist, Bernie Sanders. The senator recognized the Virginia result by declaring that\n\nLee Carter\u2019s unapologetically socialist and passionately populist candidacy unsettled establishment Democrats in Virginia, to such an extent that Richmond Times-Dispatch political writer Patrick Wilson reported in late October that the challenger had been \u201cabandoned\u201d by the party brass. With His Assault on PBS and NPR, Trump Seeks to Eliminate Real News PHOTOS: Since Standing Rock, 56 Bills Have Been Introduced in 30 States to Restrict Protests \u201cCarter, 30, a former Marine who grew up in Elizabeth City, N.C., is the kind of rogue candidate that gives an apparatus like the Democratic Party of Virginia a fit as the party makes an offensive against Republican House of Delegates incumbents across Northern Virginia and in a few other parts of the state,\u201d Wilson explained in a late-October review of the race. That had a lot to do with corporate power, and its influence on both major parties. \u201cThe [Virginia] Democratic Party establishment is aligned with Dominion Energy, a regulated monopoly, and supportive of Dominion\u2019s desire to build the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline across Virginia,\u201d the Times-Dispatch reported. Like their GOP counterparts, the Democrats are recipients of the cash Virginia\u2019s top corporate political contributor pumps into the system, and the Democratic Party of Virginia received $125,000 in 2016, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Carter opposes its plan for a natural gas pipeline and opposed its plan for a high-voltage transmission line that was to go through residential neighborhoods in Prince William County; the plan has stalled under local resistance. Environmentalists oppose the pipeline plan, with some questioning whether Atlantic Coast is necessary for Virginia\u2019s power needs. Carter said of the party establishment: \u201cI\u2019m to the left of them on economic policy. I am unabashedly pro-union, pro-worker. I\u2019m openly fighting against the large corporate interests. That\u2019s something that you don\u2019t see a lot of politicians in either party do very much of\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a good thing Carter kept the faith. His victory was critical for Virginia Democrats, who picked up enough seats to position themselves on the verge of taking charge of the House of Delegates for the first time in almost two decades. Carter recognized something that elite Democrats did not. Voters are far readier for a politics that pushes to the left on economic and social policy. And they are not particularly bothered by the word \u201csocialist.\u201d Carter\u2019s Republican opponent sent voters a pre-election mailer that juxtaposed the Marine veteran\u2019s image with those of Soviet leaders such as Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin and China\u2019s Mao Zedong. The word \u201cSocialism\u201d was splashed across the front of the red leaflet. The attack fell flat. Carter won with ease, securing almost 55 percent of the vote. And he was not alone. After the November 7 election, Democratic Socialists of America announced that its membership \u201cnow includes 15 new elected officials. This is in addition to 20 elected already in offices around the United States.\u201d From Peekskill, New York, to Moorhead, Minnesota, from Pleasant Hill, Iowa, to Knoxville, Tennessee, and Billings, Montana, DSA-backed candidates won town-council and city-council seats, school-board seats, and even a judgeship. DSA-backed candidates ran so well in the Pittsburgh area that the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported: \u201cTuesday night was an unambiguous win for at least one local political movement: Democratic Socialism.\u201d The list of democratic-socialist victories was striking\u2014the longest in decades. But it was not unprecedented. Even though critics of democratic socialism still attack candidates like Lee Carter by comparing them to foreign dictators, democratic socialism has deep roots in the United States. A century ago, candidates of the Socialist Party of Debs and Norman Thomas regularly swept local elections in cities such as Milwaukee\u2014which elected the first big-city Socialist mayor, Emil Seidel, in 1910, and later elected Socialist mayors Dan Hoan and Frank Zeidler. In cities such as Milwaukee and Reading, Pennylvania, and Bridgeport, Connecticut, Socialists served through much of the early 20th century as mayors, city attorneys, city-council members, county supervisors, sheriffs, and judges. Wisconsin sent the first Socialist Party member to the US Congress, Victor Berger, and from the 1910s through the 1930s, Socialists were frequently better represented in the Wisconsin legislature than Democrats. They were substantial Socialist Party caucuses in legislatures from New York to Oklahoma in the 1910s and 1920s. Now, a democratic socialist will serve in the Virginia legislature. If this year\u2019s surge in the numbers of elected socialists serves as a signal, the elections of 2018 could fill a good many more legislative seats in states across the country with champions of a democratic-socialist tradition that is distinctly American."}, "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Evo-Morales-Says-Drug-Trafficking-Caused-by-Capitalist-Market-20170311-0017.html": {"title": "Evo Morales Says Drug Trafficking Caused by Capitalist Market", "keywords": ["Bolivia", " South America", " Drugs", " Coca", " Evo Morales", " Capitalism"], "url": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Evo-Morales-Says-Drug-Trafficking-Caused-by-Capitalist-Market-20170311-0017.html", "text": ""}, "https://www.thenation.com/article/amy-goodman-is-facing-prison-for-reporting-on-the-dakota-access-pipeline-that-should-scare-us-all/": {"title": "Amy Goodman Is Facing Jail Time for Reporting on the Dakota Access Pipeline.

On Monday, October 17, District Judge John Grinsteiner rejected the \u201criot\u201d charge that had been leveled against Amy Goodman for her coverage of a September 3 Dakota Access Pipeline protest. Standing before the Morton County courthouse, surrounded by supporters, Goodman said: \u201cIt is a great honor to be here today. The judge\u2019s decision to reject the State\u2019s Attorney Ladd Erickson\u2019s attempt to prosecute a journalist\u2014in this case, me\u2014is a great vindication of the First Amendment.\u201d And she added: \u201c[W]e encourage all of the media to come here. We certainly will continue to cover this struggle.\u201d The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline Is a Threat to Democracy\u2014and the Planet\n\nThis Monday morning, shortly after the sun rises over the small city of Mandan, North Dakota, the award-winning journalist, and host of Democracy Now!, Amy Goodman will walk into the Morton County\u2013Mandan Combined Law Enforcement and Corrections Center and turn herself in to the local authorities. Her crime: good, unflinching journalism.\n\nGoodman had the audacity to commit this journalism on September 3, when she was in North Dakota covering what she calls \u201cthe standoff at Standing Rock\u201d: the months-long protests by thousands of Native Americans against the Dakota Access Pipeline. The $3.8 billion oil pipeline is slated to carry barrel after barrel of Bakken crude through sacred sites and burial grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and tribe members fear it could pollute the Missouri River, the source not only of their water but of millions of others\u2019, should the pipe ever rupture. Their protests, which began in April and ballooned through the summer months, represent the largest mobilization of Native American activists in more than 40 years\u2014and one of the most vital campaigns for environmental justice in perhaps as long. Goodman captured the scene as protesters were confronted by private security contractors wielding attack dogs and pepper spray.\n\nGoodman\u2019s arrival at the main protest site was significant. At the time, not a single one of the major American broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) had sent a reporter to cover the Standing Rock mobilization; none had even bothered to mention it on the air. But there was Goodman, standing at the edge of a grassy plain that was in the process of being churned into gullies of dirt, reporting on one of the most significant stories of the day. Clutching a large microphone, she captured the scene as hundreds of protesters tried desperately to stop a crew of bulldozers from tearing up the earth\u2014the earth, they said, that belongs to nobody\u2014only to be confronted by a force of private security contractors wielding attack dogs and pepper spray.\n\n\u201cPeople have gone through the fence, men, women, and children,\u201d Goodman reported, her voice taut, then rising, louder and more intense. \u201cThe bulldozers are still going, and they\u2019re yelling at the men in hard hats. One man in a hard hat threw one of the protesters down\u2026!\u201d\n\nAs Goodman narrated, a security contractor, burly in a deep blue shirt, could be seen belly-flopping a man onto the ground. Protesters streamed in to help him, stumbled over mounds of newly churned dirt, faced off with contractors whose faces were hidden behind oversized sunglasses. The scene was full of movement. Overhead, a helicopter hovered, circled, while back on the ground, protesters began to report burning eyes, and dogs\u2014dogs lurching at protesters, dogs straining against their leashes, dogs with mouths open, mouths biting. With His Assault on PBS and NPR, Trump Seeks to Eliminate Real News PHOTOS: Since Standing Rock, 56 Bills Have Been Introduced in 30 States to Restrict Protests \u201cWhy are you letting the dog go after the protesters?\u201d Goodman could be heard shouting at a security contractor as a woman screamed in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s covered in blood!\u201d Within hours of the attack, Democracy Now! had turned its footage into a seven-minute video that it released as a web exclusive. Three days later, Goodman followed up with an extensive report\u2014\u201cDakota Access Pipeline Co. Attacks Native Americans with Dogs and Pepper Spray\u201d\u2014that she broadcast live on her show. The video quickly went viral, pinging across Twitter and Facebook (where it was viewed more than 14 million times) and landing, ultimately, on the same big news stations that, until that moment, hadn\u2019t bothered to cover the protests: CNN, CBS, NBC, NPR. Goodman\u2019s report created a rare crack in the consensus of silence. And, as Rolling Stone\u2019s Matt Taibbi writes, the outrage it generated may well have influenced the Obama administration\u2019s decision to halt work on the pipeline several days later. This was journalism that mattered. Yet, on September 8, Goodman received the news that Morton County, North Dakota, had issued a warrant for her arrest. The charge: riot, a misdemeanor punishable by jail time and a fine. It should be noted that this was not the original charge leveled against Goodman; initially, she was tagged with criminal trespassing, also a misdemeanor. But in what would seem to be a clear sign of charge-shopping, the prosecutor, Ladd Erickson, switched up the crimes she had allegedly committed just days before she was set to appear in court, because, he admitted in an e-mail to Goodman\u2019s lawyer, there were \u201clegal issues with proving the notice of trespassing requirements in the statute.\u201d When asked to explain the grounds for arresting a working journalist, Erickson told the Grand Forks Herald that he did not, in fact, consider Goodman a journalist. \u201cShe\u2019s a protester, basically,\u201d Erickson told the newspaper. \u201cEverything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions.\u201d And in The Bismarck Tribune he later added, \u201cI think she put together a piece to influence the world on her agenda, basically. That\u2019s fine, but it doesn\u2019t immunize her from the laws of her state.\u201d It\u2019s worth pausing here for a moment to contemplate the full and chilling absurdity of this statement: According to Erickson, a woman who appeared at a protest carrying a microphone emblazoned with the name Democracy Now! and trailing a video crew; who can be heard in the resulting video report identifying herself to a security guard as a reporter; and who then broadcast the video on the daily news program she has hosted for 20 years is not actually a journalist. She is not a journalist, because she harbors a strong perspective, and that perspective clashes with his own. By the same distorted logic, every muckraking news gatherer from Ida Tarbell and Upton Sinclair on through I.F. Stone, and, yes, today\u2019s Matt Taibbi (whose work Erickson apparently admires) was not a journalist but an activist flirting with arrest. Goodman\u2019s report on the attack on the pipeline protesters created a rare crack in the consensus of silence. This notion should disturb anyone who labors in the journalism trenches, particularly those who dedicate their days, and often nights, to covering stories that challenge the mighty and prick at the powerful. Engaging in serious journalism\u2014journalism that captures a society\u2019s forbidden, or simply hidden, stories\u2014is hard and scary, and it requires bravery, conviction, and determination, along with an abiding faith in the protective power of the First Amendment. When that faith is compromised, the possibility of serious journalism collapses\u2014a reason, no doubt, the Committee to Protect Journalists came out forcefully on Goodman\u2019s behalf. \u201cThis arrest warrant is a transparent attempt to intimidate reporters from covering protests of significant public interest,\u201d Carlos Laur\u00eda, senior program coordinator for the Americas at CPJ, said in a statement. \u201cAuthorities in North Dakota should stop embarrassing themselves, drop the charges against Amy Goodman, and ensure that all reporters are free to do their jobs.\u201d Thus far, the North Dakota authorities remain committed to their own embarrassment; the charges have not been dropped, which is why Goodman is going back to North Dakota to turn herself in\u2014and then fight the charges. A few weeks back, as I drove with Goodman to and from a memorial service (full disclosure: Goodman is a family friend whom I have known for a long time and once worked for), I overheard an admirer of hers ask what the public could do to support her as she faced arrest. Goodman was quick to respond: keep paying attention to the protesters in North Dakota, keep caring about their fight. She, in other words, was not the story. Goodman was right, of course. The long struggle of the Standing Rock Sioux, which is a struggle against broken treaties, environmental injustice, and government-sanctioned kleptomania, is older than this country and as essential to its future as it is to its past. Yet, without someone to hold a microphone to the activists\u2019 lips or train a camera on their protests, the story often gets lost. We risk missing the message, uttered by a man with a raw voice and pained face, toward the end of Democracy Now!\u2019s viral video: \u201cNo one owns this land. This land belongs to the earth. We are only caretakers. We\u2019re caretakers of the earth.\u201d Note: This article has been updated to reflect the news that the charges against Goodman were switched from criminal trespassing to riot."}, "https://www.alternet.org/kids-grow-labor-market-teach-organize-unions": {"title": "If We Want Kids to Grow Up and Earn a Decent Living, Schools Should Teach Them to Organize Unions", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.alternet.org/kids-grow-labor-market-teach-organize-unions", "text": "If We Want Kids to Grow Up and Earn a Decent Living, Schools Should Teach Them to Organize Unions\n\nMalcolm Harris, author of Kids These Days, thinks the skills gap is bunk, and that real \"career readiness\" would prepare kids to stand up for themselves.\n\nHow are millennials stereotyped as lazy, despite being a highly efficient and productive generation? Why are millennials characterized as spoiled and entitled, yet just 6 percent of them expect to one day receive Social Security benefits like those enjoyed by current retirees? In Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials, writer Malcolm Harris explores these and other questions\u2014unpacking the precarity, the economic pressures, and the contradictions surrounding those born between 1980 and 2000.\n\nRachel Cohen: Let\u2019s talk a little about \u201chuman capital.\u201d What does that mean?\n\nMalcolm Harris: Generally speaking, human capital is the skills, abilities, talents, accomplishments, and resumes that go with you when you work. It refers to the relationship between workers and owners. What some people get wrong is thinking that we own our human capital, and that we can sell it. That\u2019s not true. We don\u2019t own ours, and nobody is legally allowed to own human capital\u2014[i.e. slaves]\u2014anymore.\n\nYou say that kids today take fewer risks, and it\u2019s partly a result of parents adopting a \u201crisk elimination\u201d approach to childrearing.\n\nThrough various means, we\u2019re forcing or compelling kids to take fewer risks. Children are living increasingly conservative lives, especially compared to the immediately preceding generations. And some people talk about it like millennials are wusses, scaredy-cats, we need our mommies\u2014stuff like that\u2014but that\u2019s all irrelevant because children do not raise themselves or define the world in which they come to be. In other words, we have to look for the sources of that risk-averse behavior with practices elsewhere.\n\nI think we can find them in this idea of human capital and treating young people like appreciating assets\u2014which gets you into the realm of risk management. In this economy, the competition has grown steeper, and the consequences of error have grown higher. The ability of people to accept risk has gone down\u2014so you have all these risk-elimination strategies for parenting, which is very hard to live with.\n\nTell me about the story of Danny Dunn, and why you think it\u2019s relevant for our time.\n\nDanny Dunn was this children\u2019s story I read when I was a kid that I found on my parents\u2019 shelf. It was written in the 1950s, and it\u2019s about this boy whose mom is a housekeeper for a scientist. Danny is always getting into the scientist\u2019s things, and one day gets a hold of this computer. Now this was a \u201850s-era computer, so really a prototype, a slow machine. You could ask it questions and it could be programmed to tell you answers. Danny finds this and decides he\u2019s going to use this machine to do his homework faster, so that he and his friends can get out of school more quickly.\n\nSome other teachers find out and tell Danny that he can\u2019t do that\u2014that it\u2019s cheating. Danny says, no, everyone can use technology, and I\u2019m just using it to lighten my workload. What\u2019s wrong, Danny asked, with doing my work faster with tools?\n\nAnd this reflects a larger social tension at the time and over the second half of the 20th century: whether workers would get the benefits of technology or if owners would. Would productivity-enhancing tools result in people working fewer hours a day and getting more leisure time, or would people work not just as hard, but harder with this technology integrated into their lives?\n\nWhat we see in Danny Dunn is that he ends up getting more homework as a result of his computer, and ultimately does more work than he had in the first place. In our modern economy, there\u2019s this idea that if people work hard and get more education, use the available tools and technology we have, build more human capital then they\u2019ll be better off. But we actually see that most people aren\u2019t better off at all.\n\nYou explore the idea that more and more skills-training has become the burden or responsibility of the job applicant, rather than of employers who could train workers on the job.\n\nIt\u2019s all about saving costs. It\u2019s obscene that a company as rich as Google complains about a lack of skilled workers and that they want someone else\u2014whether it\u2019s a charity, or a 501(c)(3), or the government\u2014to teach people how to do the work Google needs, and to pay for that training. Google should be paying for it, and the idea that this isn\u2019t the response every single time someone says \u201cskills gap\u201d is wild. We should be saying, no, we won\u2019t re-engineer the entire public education system for your benefit, and we\u2019re not going to waste our kids\u2019 time teaching them things they\u2019re likely never going to use.\n\nWouldn\u2019t the counter-argument to that be that we\u2019re not really doing this for the companies\u2019 sake, but for the students\u2019? So they can earn decent livings?\n\nBut we know that when everyone does this, the aggregate effect is that wages go down. But that\u2019s what companies want: They want it to be cheaper to pay for coders and workers with digital skills. If governments really wanted to help kids succeed in the labor market, the best correlate with high pay is union membership. Teach kids how to collectively bargain and join a union in schools. If schools wanted kids to get good jobs, strong jobs, no matter where they end up, they would teach them how to stand up for themselves and others on the job market. But we don\u2019t have any classes on that. We have \u201chere\u2019s how you can get ahead by getting skills.\u201d\n\nOn a related note, as you look at how barriers to enter various professional fields have changed\u2014you talk specifically about music artists, comedians, and actors. Can you say a bit about this?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like the homework machine example with Danny Dunn. It used to be that you could get together with your friends and make music. And if you found somewhere with lots of space, and a sound-system, you could perform with other people. That\u2019s what you could do as an individual. Now you have to do literally everything\u2014produce your music, promote your music, release your music. You can do it, you have all the tools, and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s stopping you from making the next big hit. But with that ability comes the responsibility, and people will start shouldering more and more of those tasks. So if I want to be a musician, I can\u2019t just say I don\u2019t want to do that graphic design for my album because I\u2019m practicing my music. No, you have to go design your album, or find someone who can do it for you. You can no longer say, well the record label will take care of it down the line. The label won\u2019t even look at you unless you have that done already. And this functions across the entertainment industry and beyond.\n\nYou note that no longer will attending a good school and landing a good job necessarily lead to ample leisure time. You say, \u201cfor young people who are working hard to put themselves on the successful side, they\u2019re setting themselves up for more of the same. This road is no mountain climb: It\u2019s a treadmill.\u201d I related to that passage, though it certainly feels bleak.\n\nIt is bleak but I am actually optimistic. I just think optimism has to be realistic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever go back to the jobs of the \u201850s and to that split of the national GDP between labor and capital. People who think that we can aren\u2019t really looking at the facts or the numbers, they\u2019re just sort of hoping. And that\u2019s not being optimistic, that\u2019s wishful thinking, naivet\u00e9, or delusion. Optimism is looking at the world, and at America, and seeing that history isn\u2019t over. History is still going on, and this social system\u2014with all its implications\u2014is not the be-all-end-all of life on this planet. There are other ways in which we might be able to organize ourselves. That is my optimism, though I don\u2019t think change will come in a nice, clean, or easy way.\n\nYou also say that millennials enter the labor force \u201cstructurally, legally, emotionally, culturally, and intellectually dissuaded\u201d from collectively organizing as workers. Yet polls show that millennials are pretty supportive of unions. Is this a contradiction?\n\nNo, because we\u2019re not stupid. Our cohort is starting to develop a political consciousness and it\u2019s a pretty radical one compared to anything we\u2019ve seen. Bernie Sanders got more young people\u2019s votes in the primary than Clinton and Trump combined. We\u2019re starting to develop this collective political consciousness, but at the same time, we\u2019re still stuck in systems that demand individual competition from us in ways that we know are not in our collective interest. If you\u2019re competing all the time, the implications are that you enter into this arm\u2019s race situation, a death spiral, where kids are competing over everything constantly and never getting a chance to relax. We know this isn\u2019t good for us, this system isn\u2019t working for us. But in terms of power, there\u2019s not a lot of choice right now.\n\nWhat should parents or schools be doing differently?\n\nI don\u2019t think I have a lot of great advice for parents or schools. The problem is we have our policies and society built around everyone trying to get the most for their own child as opposed to thinking about everyone\u2019s children. It\u2019s the same with schools\u2014everyone\u2019s success is someone else\u2019s failure. But this is a collective action problem; it\u2019s not something we can solve by changing the behavior of individual parents or schools.\n\nThat said, teachers don\u2019t have to give these standardized tests. The official union position is that these high-stakes tests are bad, yet teachers have been crucial in administering them.\n\nWhat about kids? Can they be doing anything differently?\n\nI focus on kids\u2019 labor in the book. I think kids could be organizing for student power, organizing for less work, to work less hard. We tend to demonize that desire or interest but it\u2019s in every worker\u2019s interest to work less hard.\n\nWhat is your ultimate hope for the book?\n\nI hope it gives people, young people in particular, a frame for their experience and for the changes they see in the world. I hope it might be useful for thinking about American society and their lives in a different context, maybe one they haven\u2019t heard before.\n\nThe longer we keep debating things like avocado toast, asking if young people are spoiled, the longer we talk about those things, the more we ignore things that are actually true\u2014based in fact, evidence, and data.\n\nThis interview originally appeared in The American Prospect.

She is leading a campaign to kill the trial, citing high taxpayer costs and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pay people to not work,\u201d she added.\n\nA similar model has long ignited controversy in France, ever since a Socialist government made a 35-hour workweek mandatory in 2000. Companies complain it has reduced competitiveness and created billions in additional costs for hiring and social charges. Unions defend the law as shielding workers from employers who might otherwise return to excessively long work hours.\n\nThe measure is now riddled with so many loopholes that most employees currently work around 40 hours a week, on par with the European Union average. But President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is facing nationwide strikes as he seeks to further ease parts of the law.\n\nSuch concerns have not deterred a growing number of small businesses in Sweden from testing the concept. Many found that a shorter workday can reduce turnover, enhance employee creativity and lift productivity enough to offset the cost of hiring additional staff.\n\n\u201cWe thought doing a shorter workweek would mean we\u2019d have to hire more, but it hasn\u2019t resulted in that because everyone works more efficiently,\u201d said Maria Brath, who founded an Internet search optimization start-up in Stockholm three years ago based on a six-hour day. The company, which has 20 employees, has doubled its revenue and profit each year.\n\n\u201cSince we work fewer hours, we are constantly figuring out ways to do more with our time,\u201d Ms. Brath said.\n\nSitting inside their airy office, Brath\u2019s employees checked off the ways. \u201cWe don\u2019t send unnecessary emails or tie ourselves up in meetings,\u201d said Thommy Ottinger, a pay-per-click specialist. \u201cIf you have only six hours to work, you don\u2019t waste your time or other people\u2019s time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a life changer,\u201d he said, adding that the environment inspired fierce staff loyalty.\n\nAt Gothenburg\u2019s Sahlgrenska University Hospital, one of the biggest in Europe, officials have tried a similar approach to counter burnout and high absenteeism.\n\nLast year, the orthopedics unit switched 89 nurses and doctors to a six-hour day. It hired 15 new staff members to make up for the lost time and extend operating room hours. At 1 million kroner (about $123,000) a month, the experiment was expensive, said Anders Hyltander, the executive director. But since then, almost no one calls in sick, and nurses and doctors have been more efficient.\n\n\u201cI had reached a point where I could only work at 80 percent capacity,\u201d said Gabrielle Tikman, a surgical nurse. \u201cNow it\u2019s easier to rest and I have time at home to sit and really talk with my children. I\u2019ve got my power back.\u201d\n\nThe unit is performing 20 percent more operations, generating additional business from treatments like hip replacements that would have gone to other hospitals. Surgery waiting times were cut to weeks from months, allowing patients to return to work faster and reducing sick leave elsewhere in the economy, Mr. Hyltander said.\n\n\u201cFor years, we\u2019ve been told that an eight-hour workday is optimal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we should let ourselves challenge that view and say, \u2018Yes that\u2019s the way it is now, but if you want to increase productivity, be open to new ideas.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe hospital was inspired by a nearby Toyota vehicle service center, which moved to a six-hour day 13 years ago to address employee stress and customer complaints about long waiting times. The new system keeps the garages open longer and reels in new business.\n\n\u201cWhat we can see today is that employees are at the very least doing the same amount in the six-hour workday, often more than they did in the eight-hour day,\u201d said Martin Banck, the service center\u2019s director. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy work \u2014 drilling, building engine blocks \u2014 but they have stamina, and we have more profit and customers because cars get fixed faster.\u201d\n\nAnd employees say that more downtime makes them happier on the job. \u201cSimply put, we work more efficiently,\u201d said Matthias Larsson, 33. Thanks to his shorter hours, Mr. Larsson can care for his three children, cook, clean and shop while his wife is at work.\n\nWhile a six-hour day may fit smaller organizations, larger Swedish companies have not rushed to embrace it. And other towns in Sweden that previously tested shorter workdays ultimately abandoned them. In the northern city of Kiruna, officials scrapped a six-hour day for 250 municipal employees after 16 years, citing high expenses and resentment among workers who were not part of the program.\n\nBack at Svartedalens, Mr. Perez hopes the same fate will not befall him. \u201cWe never dreamed that there\u2019d be a six-hour day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel joy coming to work here.\u201d\n\nIngrid Karlson, a 90-year-old tenant, nodded from her wheelchair. \u201cThe personnel are completely different,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re happier and we\u2019re happier.\u201d"}, "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/04/a-texan-who-called-obama-a-gay-prostitute-may-soon-control-what-goes-in-childrens-textbooks/": {"title": "A Texan who called Obama a gay prostitute may soon control what goes in children\u2019s textbooks", "keywords": ["Texas", " textbooks", " Republican primary", " education"], "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/04/a-texan-who-called-obama-a-gay-prostitute-may-soon-control-what-goes-in-childrens-textbooks/", "text": "Mary Lou Bruner stood before the Texas State Board of Education in 2010 to talk about textbooks. She was concerned, she said during her testimony, that the state\u2019s curriculum was being controlled by outside forces.\n\nHer statements were introduced by board member Lawrence Allen (D): \u201cYou believe \u2026 people from the Middle East are buying, using their dollars, to persuade textbook publishers to put more \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Middle Easterners are buying the textbooks!\u201d Bruner said, wide-eyed. \u201cThey\u2019re buying everything else here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, they\u2019re buying the, the morality of the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re using their influence to get what they want in the textbooks,\u201d Bruner nodded.\n\nThat was more than five years ago, and the tables have since turned for the 68-year-old retired schoolteacher from Smith County. Back then, Bruner was just a citizen airing her grievances before the state\u2019s public officials. Now, she is poised to sit on the board herself \u2014 and to wield the kind of influence she once associated with \u201cMiddle Easterners.\u201d\n\nBruner received 48 percent of the vote in a three-person GOP primary for a seat on the Texas State Board of Education this Tuesday, falling just short of the 50 percent needed to claim victory. She will compete in a May runoff election against Keven Ellis, a chiropractor and city school board president who earned 31 percent of the vote.\n\nThe chosen Republican candidate is expected to beat her Democratic opponent in the general election, the Houston Chronicle reported. And given the support she has received so far, that candidate will most likely be Bruner.\n\nMembers of the state board of education wield considerable influence over Texas curriculums. The board changed the state\u2019s social studies standards in 2010 after it decided that the previous standards had a liberal slant, but even these revisions have earned a D rating from the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute.\n\n\u201cThe document distorts or suppresses less triumphal or more nuanced aspects of our past that the Board found politically unacceptable (slavery and segregation are all but ignored, while religious influences are grossly exaggerated),\u201d read the institute\u2019s review of Texas standards. \u201cComplex historical issues are obscured with blatant politicizing.\u201d\n\nThese curriculum guidelines dictate how publishers write textbooks for Texas schools. And as the state has an outsize market, the content of those textbooks can influence materials nationwide.\n\n[Texas officials: Schools should teach that slavery was \u2018side issue\u2019 to Civil War]\n\nThis looming reality has left many concerned about Bruner\u2019s candidacy, and not just because of her documented aversion to Muslims. In Facebook posts originally reported by the Texas Freedom Network, a nonpartisan watchdog group monitoring the far right, Bruner shared her views on a number of subjects.\n\nOn climate change, she wrote last June: \u201cClimate change has nothing to do with weather or climate; it is all about system change from capitalism (free enterprise) to Socialism-Communism. The Climate Change HOAX was Karl Marx\u2019s idea.\u201d\n\nOn the Civil War, she wrote in 2014: \u201cSlavery is not the Reason for the Civil War. by [sic] Mary Lou Bruner\u2026. Historians waited until all of the people who were alive during the Civil War and the Restoration were dead of old age. THEN HISTORIANS WROTE THE HISTORY BOOKS TO TELL THE STORY THE WAY THEY WANTED IT TOLD.\u201d\n\nOn the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, she wrote last November: \u201cMany people believe the Democrat Party had JFK killed because the socialists and Communists in the party did not want a conservative president.\u201d\n\nAs recently as last October, Bruner declared in a post that President Obama used to be a gay prostitute:\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart last month about these statements, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to apologize for my opinions because I still believe my statements are accurate.\u201d\n\nBruner holds a Masters of Education degree from East Texas State University and worked as a teacher and counselor in Texas public schools for 36 years. Her campaign website states that if she is elected, she will \u201cadvocate for a return to traditional education,\u201d \u201cpromote conservative curriculum standards aligned with Texas values\u201d and \u201cprotect the children\u2019s textbook fund from lobbyists.\u201d\n\nShe accused the Texas Freedom Network of launching a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her in a phone conversation with The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey stole that election from me,\u201d Bruner said with anger in her voice, in reference to just narrowly missing the mark for a win. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019m misrepresented. I got 48 percent of the vote, and I got it out there telling people the truth.\u201d\n\nShe declined to answer questions about claims made on her Facebook page, and instead lamented the state of journalism and politics: \u201cI\u2019m just not interested in giving an interview to The Washington Post, because Washington is where all the corruption is. I don\u2019t think Washington cares about the people of the United States of America \u2014 the majority of them up in Washington are corrupt. The majority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe press is going after me with barrels of ink,\u201d Bruner said, \u201cand I\u2019m just one little person.\u201d\n\nDan Quinn, communications director for the Texas Freedom Network, laughed at the idea that the organization \u201cstole\u201d the election. \u201cWelcome to the game,\u201d he said in a phone interview with The Post.\n\nWhile Bruner has never held public office before, Quinn believes her campaign is being buoyed by tea party and social conservative groups that have spread the word through a vast network of email chains and newsletters.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time believing that most people in east Texas think Obama was a gay prostitute,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThose kinds of comments are so outside of the mainstream, but most people in the mainstream don\u2019t vote. The people who vote in primaries are the conspiracy theorists. Not all of them, but a good number of them.\u201d\n\nSocial conservatives have dominated the State Board of Education for some time \u2014 the seat for which Bruner is running used to be occupied by creationist Don McLeroy \u2014 but few have been quite as outspoken or inflammatory as Bruner.\n\n\u201cThe others are a bit more careful about how outrageous their public comments are,\u201d said Quinn, who had \u201cno doubt\u201d that if elected, Bruner would \u201cbring her agenda with her\u201d in curriculum discussions.\n\nWith that, the fight over Texas textbooks \u2014 and in turn, textbooks across the country \u2014 is expected to rage on. Last October, a former teacher in Pearland, Tex., prompted an apology from McGraw-Hill Education after she revealed in a viral Facebook post that her 15-year-old son\u2019s public school textbooks referred to slaves as \u201cworkers\u201d in its \u201cImmigration\u201d chapter.\n\n\u201cThis is revisionist history, retelling the story however the winners would like it told,\u201d the mother, Roni Dean-Burren, told The Post at the time.\n\nLast November, the board approved about 90 social studies textbooks that had been deemed inaccurate, biased and politicized by the Education Fund of the Texas Freedom Network.\n\nQuinn believes that it will be no surprise, then, if Bruner\u2019s ideas garner support from other board members in the event of her election.\n\n\u201cTexas has been the butt of jokes for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis certainly doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nBehold, people of China: The four known times Xi Jinping has cried\n\n\u2018Bernie Baby,\u2019 the adorable 4-month-old Sanders lookalike, has died from SIDS"}, "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-22/obama-white-collar-overtime-pay-mandate-blocked-by-judge": {"title": "Obama White-Collar Overtime Pay Mandate Blocked by Judge", "keywords": ["Barack Obama", "Justice Department", "Texas", "Congress", "Labor", "U.S. Republicans", "Law", "Louisiana", "politics"], "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-22/obama-white-collar-overtime-pay-mandate-blocked-by-judge", "text": "An Obama administration policy that would have given more white-collar workers overtime starting Dec. 1 was blocked nationwide by a federal judge in Texas.\n\nThe decision Tuesday is a victory for 21 states and dozens of business groups that sued, complaining the new rule would increase government costs in their states by $115 million next year alone and would put private employers on the hook for millions of dollars more, possibly leading to layoffs.\n\nIt\u2019s the fourth time in 21 months that a federal judge in Texas has issued a nationwide injunction blocking one of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders. Other stalled Obama initiatives involve shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation, mandating bathroom access for transgender students, and requiring labor-violation disclosures by federal contractors.\n\nThe rule would have doubled the maximum salary cap to $47,892 a year for full-time executive, administrative and professional workers to be exempt from overtime pay requirements. The higher cutoff, along with a provision to periodically increase it, would have extended overtime protections to millions of full-time salaried workers, just 7 percent of whom are currently protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act compared with 62 percent in 1975, according to the government.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amos L. Mazzant III in Sherman, Texas, rejected a request by the federal government to limit any order to the states that filed the lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction blocking the new salary cutoff nationwide.\n\nBy requiring employers to pay overtime wages based on salary rather than an employee\u2019s duties, the Labor Department exceeded its authority under the Fair Labor Standards Act and ignored Congress\u2019s intent, Mazzant said in his ruling. \u201cIf Congress intended the salary requirement to supplant the duties test, then Congress and not the department should make that change,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the decision by the court, which has the effect of delaying a fair day\u2019s pay for a long day\u2019s work for millions of hardworking Americans,\" the Labor Department said in a statement. \"The department\u2019s overtime rule is the result of a comprehensive, inclusive rule-making process, and we remain confident in the legality of all aspects of the rule. We are currently considering all of our legal options.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department failed to consider regional salary and economic differences in setting the nationwide base pay rate, opponents said in challenging the new rule. They also complained the Obama administration disregarded the abilities of smaller public and private employers to pay higher salaries that would automatically ratchet up every three years.\n\nThe arguments by both sides turned partly on rule-making requirements under federal law.\n\nThe states -- all of them except Louisiana headed by Republican governors -- claim the Obama administration usurped Congress\u2019s exclusive authority to set minimum wages and ignored the requirement to allow public comment before the statutory salary level automatically indexes every three years.\n\nLabor Department officials said they followed all federal rule-making procedures, evaluating more than 270,000 public comments before finalizing the change.\n\nJustice Department lawyers had asked Mazzant to at least let the new rule take effect in the 29 states that didn\u2019t sue, to update salary triggers that haven\u2019t changed since 2004. Rising wages and broad workplace definitions of what constitutes white-collar jobs have \u201cleft employees who should not be exempt without overtime protection,\u201d the government said in court filings.\n\nThe case is Nevada v U.S. Department of Labor, 16-00731, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Sherman)."}, "https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/04/banks-credit-recession-finance-socialism/": {"title": "Socialize the Banks", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/04/banks-credit-recession-finance-socialism/", "text": "Nine years after the onset of the international financial crisis, its effects are still with us. These days observers worry about banks \u2014 European institutions like Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank, France\u2019s Societ\u00e9 Generale, and Italy\u2019s Monte di Pascoale, not to mention the zombie banks that populate the austerity-ridden eurozone periphery in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. These big banks are widely seen as global capitalism\u2019s next weak link, capable of causing massive financial instability if they go bust. Such concern isn\u2019t particularly surprising \u2014 banks were at the center of the latest crisis from the beginning. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t subprime market defaults that unleashed the destructive financial turmoil of 2007\u20138, but their ruinous impact on a major investment bank, Lehman Brothers. Lehman\u2019s failure \u2014 and the state\u2019s subsequent refusal to bail out the bank \u2014 created a credit crunch that sent the entire financial sector, as well as the world economy, into a tailspin. As the US crisis morphed into the eurozone crisis, banks were again at the epicenter. The debt burden of peripheral states and the prospect of their default threatened the solvency of the entire European banking sector, which had lent to agents public and private. Europe\u2019s major banks, already troubled by their souring US investments (among other things) faced collapse. Only the quick substitution of bank-held debt for official debt \u2014 taken on from the troika of European lenders and the IMF in return for punitive fiscal austerity \u2014 saved them. Yet here we are today, facing another potential wave of failing banks. The lingering instability highlights the hollowness of the G-20 countries\u2019 pledges to reform the financial sector in 2008-09. Promises to \u201cextend regulatory oversight and registration to Credit Rating Agencies,\u201d \u201ctake action against non-cooperative jurisdictions, including tax havens,\u201d and \u201cprevent excessive leverage and require buffers of resources to be built up in good times\u201d have yielded little substantive change. Granted, bank reform legislation has been passed in both the US and Europe. The Dodd-Frank Act in the US, the Eric Liikanen working group recommendations in the European Union, and, ultimately, the Bank of International Settlements\u2019 Basel III regulation all raised capital and liquidity requirements and produced new resolution mechanisms for banks. But once the initial shock of the crisis passed, banks lobbied intensely to water down the rules, and regulators set an extremely low bar for compliance. The banking business, in short, resumed its old practices \u2014 but now in a financial landscape marked by even larger banks that posed far greater systemic risks to the world economy.\n\nSo as the banks have a field day, where is the Left? Seemingly nowhere to be found. In the core capitalist countries, the Left has repeatedly failed to crawl out from its defensive trenches and seize the opportunity that the crisis opened. Proposals concerning the financial sector have been weak at best, limited to regulation and taxation measures, such as the popular \u201cTobin Tax.\u201d Meanwhile, questions about how banks should be organized and governed aren\u2019t even raised. The Left has either latched onto market-based arguments of \u201clet them fail\u201d or turned to more benign liberal solutions like breaking up big banks. As a result, it has failed to contribute to crucial debates about modern capitalism\u2019s pivotal institutions. Part of the reason why is the Left\u2019s profound weakness: it has little capacity to propose and implement new policies that benefit the working class. But the Left\u2019s tendency to shy away from debates about banks and finance is rooted in other factors as well. For one, the Left tends to emphasize production over circulation, the sphere where finance is located. As a result the role of finance is under-examined, dismissed as a big Ponzi scheme that capital escapes to when it\u2019s faced with a \u201cstructural blockage\u201d in the sphere of production. At the same time (particularly since the 2008\u20132010 crisis), the Left has viewed credit with extreme suspicion, often seeing it as an inherent evil to be restrained. But while the effects of financialization have been dire for many ordinary people, credit is central to any economy, capitalist or otherwise. As pointed by the political economist, Costas Lapavitsas, originating in the pre-capitalist exchange of commodities (like cloth and foodstuffs), credit is predicated on the lender-borrower interaction: the lender knows something about the borrower\u2019s material circumstances, then chooses whether to enter into a relationship defined by the \u201cpromise to pay.\u201d In capitalism \u2014 where loanable capital is common and often doled out by banks \u2014 the social relations behind credit are quite depersonalized. Borrowers are much more homogenized, and their ability to repay is gauged by purportedly objective criteria like present-day credit scores. Banks integrate and mobilize these criteria \u2014 information that is unavailable to other economic agents \u2014 through their privileged access to the financial dealings of firms and households. The ability to assess the soundness of a borrower\u2019s \u201cpromises to pay\u201d puts banks in a powerful position. And this position is reinforced by banks\u2019 other information-gathering activities \u2014 account management, asset management, foreign exchange \u2014 which fall outside lending activities but are at the core of investment banking. The terrain on which banks operate (and compete) has been in flux since the 1970s. Liberalization, deregulation (and capital-friendly re-regulation) of financial markets, and the rollback of public services have conspired with new technologies to create entirely new financial markets, products, and agents. Financial income, in turn, has migrated to more and more sectors, including housing (in the form of mortgage payments), pensions (commissions and fees charged on private pension funds), and even utilities (bonds and similar mechanisms for financing infrastructure). The rise of capital markets and the emergence of new financial agents have not caused the traditional banking sector to wither. New markets opened by public policy, new credit assessment instruments, and faster access to data have simply given banks new agents and markets to loan money to \u2014 like households, who have become the main recipients of loanable capital in most developed countries, particularly in the form of mortgages. Banks have also entered the lucrative market of managing savings and financial assets. As a result, banks have grown bigger, with expanding balance sheets and increasing profits relative to the overall economy. Contemporary states have helped spur this financialization of the global economy, expanding their purview far beyond constructing new financial markets or transforming the provision of different goods and services for capital\u2019s benefit. Governments today play a paramount role in backing banks\u2019 power. The reason is fairly straightforward: banks hold, through deposits, \u201cpromises to pay\u201d that have a shorter maturity than their assets (others\u2019 promises to pay). Or, more simply, they owe more than they hold at any given time. This imbalance is a source of potential fragility, as was clear during the 2008 liquidity shortage. In order to prevent boom-and-bust cycles, the state stepped in, providing a financial backstop through its control of the money supply. Banks are given exclusive access to central bank reserves, which banks use to settle their liabilities. By conferring on banks the ability to create credit (and money) \u2014 a right that other economic agents don\u2019t have \u2014 states give banks an incomparable power over the rest of the economy.\n\nThe special relationship between banks and the state became clear in the recent financial meltdown. As trust in the money markets evaporated, banks became dependent on state institutions to survive, let alone thrive. Banks relied on emergency loans from central banks to sustain their liquidity mismatch, which would have otherwise thrown them quickly into bankruptcy. Governments also restored their solvency through emergency programs. States bought billions of dollars of worthless assets (through the Troubled Asset Relief Program in the US, for instance) or added regulatory capital through contingent bonds and tax credits or public money transfers (as with the UK\u2019s \u201ctemporary\u201d nationalizations). States provided implicit and explicit subsidies to banks by boosting guarantees on deposits, carrying out unprecedented quantitative easing programs that granted banks safe returns through asset buying, and lowering interest rates to historic lows, thereby reducing banks\u2019 funding costs. The transfer of public resources to private banks was extraordinary. Yet the rescue measures were wrapped in financial jargon and a sense of political inevitability, and so, despite some halfhearted grumbling by lawmakers, they largely escaped public scrutiny. That may be changing. The state\u2019s heavy footprint in the financial sector is making it increasingly difficult to argue banks should remain privately owned. Why should profits accrue to shareholders, after all, when the risks and losses are socialized? Public banks are not a novelty of course. Many countries, such as Germany and France, have long had such institutions, either in the form of commercial banks or development banks that provide loans to specific economic sectors. And public ownership alone is no silver bullet for challenging global capitalism and its attendant crises. More often than not, these banks behave no differently than their private counterparts, or are controlled by public bureaucracies that end up serving particular private interests. Simply put, public ownership of banks is necessary but not sufficient. For public control to be liberatory, it must be part of an expansive vision that reshapes the practices and uses of credit along egalitarian lines. Private finance has promoted the commodification of (and shaped the organization of) key sectors like health and education. Taking control of credit must mean democratizing access to these essential services. On the question of bank governance, it is not enough to have public officials in charge. Unions, social movement actors (like consumer organizations), and elected officials from both local and central government must have a role in their management. A progressive finance policy can only be enacted when a variety of societal actors, who all possess specific knowledge and interests, have a say in the organization and provision of credit. Considering the global nature of contemporary finance, any plan to socialize the credit system \u2014 and reform the relation between money, credit, and state \u2014 must also take into account the highly unequal power relations that characterize the global economy. US, as issuer of the dollar, controls a quasi-world currency that\u2019s commonly used to settle international liabilities even between non-American agents. This gives the US immense power over the world economy, unmatched by any other country. Through its own banks, the US controls the quantity and price (interest rates) of dollars used across the globe. (The euro \u2014 which is primarily controlled by Germany, the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy \u2014 also enjoys global reach.) In this context, any attempt to socialize the credit system must take into account the specificities of each country: how it is integrated into the world economy and how it can be disconnected from the chains of international finance and gain the space it needs to pursue its own economic and social policies. Its balance of payments position, external indebtedness, and foreign currency reserve position are constraints that have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. For instance, it is difficult to imagine how any peripheral country in the eurozone could nationalize its banks without breaking with the euro, regaining sovereignty over its own currency, ending central bank independence, and introducing strict capital controls. After years of financial crisis, rising inequality, and \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d the time is ripe for the Left to advance an egalitarian project that places finance at the center. This doesn\u2019t mean a \u201cone size fits all\u201d program. Each country will have to devise its own socialized system of credit.

Yet last November Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest foodmaker and one of the most recognisable household brands, went public with the news it had found forced labour in its supply chains in Thailand and that its customers were buying products tainted with the blood and sweat of poor, unpaid and abused migrant workers.\n\nBy independently disclosing that Nestl\u00e9 customers had unwittingly bought products contaminated by the very worst labour abuses, the company said it was moving into a new era of self-policing of its own supply chains. A year-long investigation by the company confirmed media reports that the seafood industry in Thailand is riddled with forced labour and human trafficking and that slave labour was involved in the production of its Fancy Feast catfood brand. \n\n\n\nNestl\u00e9 also made sure to make it clear that no other company sourcing seafood from Thailand, the world\u2019s third-largest seafood exporter, could have avoided being exposed to the same risks.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve said consistently, forced labour and human rights abuses have no place in our supply chain,\u201d said Magdi Batato, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s executive vice-president in charge of operations, in a written statement. \u201cNestl\u00e9 believes that by working with suppliers we can make a positive difference to the sourcing of ingredients.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe disclosure was considered by many to be ground-breaking. Nick Grono, the chief executive of NGO the Freedom Fund, which has invested heavily in anti-trafficking initiatives in Thailand, believes Nestl\u00e9\u2019s admission could be a considerable force in shifting the parameters of what can be expected of businesses when it comes to supply chain accountability. \n\n\n\n\u201cNestl\u00e9\u2019s decision to conduct this investigation is to be applauded,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got one of the biggest brands in the world proactively coming out and admitting that they have found slavery in their business operations, then it\u2019s potentially a huge game-changer and could lead to real and sustained change in how supply chains are managed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe research (pdf) for Nestl\u00e9\u2019s report was conducted by US corporate accountability business Verit\u00e9, which works closely with organisations trying to help improve their supply chain transparency.\n\nLast year Verit\u00e9 was involved in another exercise in self-disclosure by outdoor clothing company Patagonia, which announced that it had discovered several points in its supply chain in Taiwan where forced labour and unethical recruitment practices were flourishing.\n\nVerite\u2019s chief executive, Dan Viederman, said: \u201cIn the last six months Verit\u00e9 has been involved in two high-profile disclosures from major brands and one of the most important lessons for us to recognise is that in neither case did the companies suffer greatly in terms of being associated with these labour conditions. Instead, they received some credit [for] being bold enough to be associated with this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really hope that the recent examples help mobilise companies to be bolder and investigate more deeply because soon the reputational damage in not doing so could be considerable\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Viederman, the biggest issue is working out how to manage the disclosures into actual change for vulnerable people trapped at the bottom of global commodity chains. \n\n\n\nThere is also a growing legal imperative for many large multinationals to start seriously engaging with labour abuses in their business operations. Legislation in both the US and the UK requires larger companies to publish annual reports on their efforts to keep their businesses slavery-free.\n\nThe success of the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act has been patchy but it has spawned a series of civil litigation suits, with consumers or workers using the legislation to launch legal actions against companies they accuse of making misleading public statements on their anti-slavery efforts.\n\n\n\nNestl\u00e9 is one of the companies facing legal action in the US. Last week the company, along with Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, failed in its bid to get the US Supreme Court to throw out a lawsuit seeking to hold them liable for the alleged use of child slaves in cocoa farming in the Ivory Coast.\n\nThis puts the company in the unfortunate position of disclosing slavery in one part of its operations, while at the same time fighting through the courts to fend off accusations that it exists in another \u2013 more profitable \u2013 part of its business.\n\n\n\nAndrew Wallis, chief executive of Unseen UK, an anti-trafficking charity advocating for more supply chain accountability, said: \u201cFor me there is a big issue with one part of Nestl\u00e9 saying, \u2018OK we have been dragged along with everyone else to face the issue of slavery in Thailand and so let\u2019s take the initiative and do something about it\u2019, and at the same time fighting tooth and nail through the courts to avoid charges of child slavery in its core operations in the Ivory Coast.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe argues that Nestl\u00e9\u2019s self-reporting could also be seen as a tactic to head off or deflate other pending civil litigation suits.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to own up to something that has already been uncovered,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the time Nestl\u00e9 owned up to slavery in the Thai seafood industry it was accepted knowledge. It\u2019ll be a brave new world when companies are actually doing the real investigation to probe into part of their supply chains that have remained outside the public domain.\n\n\u201cWe need to move into a space where we say, \u2018We\u2019re all guilty; let\u2019s get past that to a place where we can properly address the problem\u2019 \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d\n\n\n\nSign up for the Guardian sustainable business newsletter to receive more stories like this in your inbox."}, "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists": {"title": "Nasa-funded study: industrial civilisation headed for 'irreversible collapse'? | Nafeez Ahmed", "keywords": ["Environment", "Science", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Energy", "Energy research", "Economic policy", "Poverty", "World news"], "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists", "text": "A new study partly-sponsored by Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center has highlighted the prospect that global industrial civilisation could collapse in coming decades due to unsustainable resource exploitation and increasingly unequal wealth distribution.\n\nNoting that warnings of 'collapse' are often seen to be fringe or controversial, the study attempts to make sense of compelling historical data showing that \"the process of rise-and-collapse is actually a recurrent cycle found throughout history.\" Cases of severe civilisational disruption due to \"precipitous collapse - often lasting centuries - have been quite common.\"\n\nThe independent research project is based on a new cross-disciplinary 'Human And Nature DYnamical' (HANDY) model, led by applied mathematician Safa Motesharrei of the US National Science Foundation-supported National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center, in association with a team of natural and social scientists. The HANDY model was created using a minor Nasa grant, but the study based on it was conducted independently. The study based on the HANDY model has been accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed Elsevier journal, Ecological Economics.\n\nIt finds that according to the historical record even advanced, complex civilisations are susceptible to collapse, raising questions about the sustainability of modern civilisation:\n\nBy investigating the human-nature dynamics of these past cases of collapse, the project identifies the most salient interrelated factors which explain civilisational decline, and which may help determine the risk of collapse today: namely, Population, Climate, Water, Agriculture, and Energy.\n\nThese factors can lead to collapse when they converge to generate two crucial social features: \"the stretching of resources due to the strain placed on the ecological carrying capacity\"; and \"the economic stratification of society into Elites [rich] and Masses (or \"Commoners\") [poor]\" These social phenomena have played \"a central role in the character or in the process of the collapse,\" in all such cases over \"the last five thousand years.\"\n\nCurrently, high levels of economic stratification are linked directly to overconsumption of resources, with \"Elites\" based largely in industrialised countries responsible for both:\n\nThe study challenges those who argue that technology will resolve these challenges by increasing efficiency:\n\nProductivity increases in agriculture and industry over the last two centuries has come from \"increased (rather than decreased) resource throughput,\" despite dramatic efficiency gains over the same period.\n\nModelling a range of different scenarios, Motesharrei and his colleagues conclude that under conditions \"closely reflecting the reality of the world today... we find that collapse is difficult to avoid.\" In the first of these scenarios, civilisation:\n\nAnother scenario focuses on the role of continued resource exploitation, finding that \"with a larger depletion rate, the decline of the Commoners occurs faster, while the Elites are still thriving, but eventually the Commoners collapse completely, followed by the Elites.\"\n\nIn both scenarios, Elite wealth monopolies mean that they are buffered from the most \"detrimental effects of the environmental collapse until much later than the Commoners\", allowing them to \"continue 'business as usual' despite the impending catastrophe.\" The same mechanism, they argue, could explain how \"historical collapses were allowed to occur by elites who appear to be oblivious to the catastrophic trajectory (most clearly apparent in the Roman and Mayan cases).\"\n\nApplying this lesson to our contemporary predicament, the study warns that:\n\nHowever, the scientists point out that the worst-case scenarios are by no means inevitable, and suggest that appropriate policy and structural changes could avoid collapse, if not pave the way toward a more stable civilisation.\n\nThe two key solutions are to reduce economic inequality so as to ensure fairer distribution of resources, and to dramatically reduce resource consumption by relying on less intensive renewable resources and reducing population growth:\n\nThe NASA-funded HANDY model offers a highly credible wake-up call to governments, corporations and business - and consumers - to recognise that 'business as usual' cannot be sustained, and that policy and structural changes are required immediately.\n\nAlthough the study based on HANDY is largely theoretical - a 'thought-experiment' - a number of other more empirically-focused studies - by KPMG and the UK Government Office of Science for instance - have warned that the convergence of food, water and energy crises could create a 'perfect storm' within about fifteen years.

The controversy badly damaged Mylan's reputation and wiped out billions of dollars of market value.\n\nYet Mylan still lavished former CEO Robert Coury with $98 million in pay for 2016 as he transitioned to the role of executive chairman.\n\nIn a report published on Monday, ISS criticized the \"outsized compensation\" in the face of \"harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies\" and \"steep shareholder losses.\"\n\nGlass Lewis, another advisory firm, put out a separate report on Friday slamming Coury's \"colossal pay package\" and giving Mylan an \"F\" for its compensation decisions.\n\nBoth firms urged Mylan shareholders to vote against the nonbinding \"say-on-pay\" proposal at the company's June 22 annual meeting. Mylan's pay practices were unpopular even before the EpiPen scandal. The say-on-pay proposal only received 65.2% of support last year.\n\nISS and Glass Lewis also recommended ousting Mylan directors Wendy Cameron, Neil Dimick and Mark Parish, all of whom sit on the compensation committee that approves executive pay.\n\nISS is going a step further by saying all 10 of Mylan's existing directors should be voted out, including CEO Heather Bresch. The Mylan boss caught flak last summer by trying to pin the blame for the EpiPen sticker shock on a shadowy health care supply chain rather than accept responsibility.\n\nIn particular, ISS chastised Mylan's board for failing to \"head off the negative scrutiny\" over the company's risky price strategy \"despite significant warning signs over a number of years.\"\n\nFor instance, two years before the EpiPen scandal there was Congressional inquiry linked to generic drug price increases.\n\nThe EpiPen controversy \"has laid bare a record of poor stewardship and responsiveness\" by Mylan's board,\" ISS said.\n\nIn addition to being hauled before Congress, Mylan agreed in October to pay $465 million to settle federal allegations that it falsely classified EpiPen to overcharge Medicaid. Mylan did not admit to any wrongdoing.\n\nDespite all the outrage, Mylan's board may still be safe. The drug maker requires two-thirds of the votes cast at a meeting to unseat a director.\n\nAnd Mylan slammed the ISS call as \"simply irrational\" because it would leave the company \"without any leadership.\" Mylan said in a statement it's \"confident\" shareholders will \"recognize that that this Board has overseen a period of strong and sustainable long-term growth.\"\n\nMylan also sought to soothe concerns by sending a letter to shareholders on Monday arguing that Coury has been \"integral to the success of Mylan and he will continue to provide strategic leadership for the next five years.\"\n\nBut some powerful investors see it otherwise. A group of pension funds led by the New York City and New York State pension funds also launched a campaign late last month to oust Coury and five other Mylan directors.\n\n\"From Mylan allegedly overcharging the government for life-saving drugs to the board overpaying top executives, it's clear why shareowners are demanding change,\" NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"The stage is set for shareowners to deliver real change at Mylan,\" Stringer said."}, "https://socialistworker.org/2017/04/20/why-capitalism-clings-to-fossil-fuels": {"title": "Why capitalism clings to fossil fuels", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://socialistworker.org/2017/04/20/why-capitalism-clings-to-fossil-fuels", "text": "The hopeful predictions that a new era of renewable energy is here are dangerously premature, writes James Plested in an article written for Australia's Red Flag .\n\nWHO CAN forget the image? George W. Bush's stupid, blank face staring out across the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln under a giant banner emblazoned with the words \"Mission accomplished.\"\n\nThe date was May 1, 2003--a little over a month after the U.S. launched its invasion of Iraq--and Bush was there to declare an end to major combat operations. As it turned out, this was somewhat premature.\n\nToday, the environment movement seems to be having a \"mission accomplished\" moment of its own. With the price of renewables such as solar in free fall and new battery technology coming online, many environmentalists are sounding the death knell of fossil fuels.\n\nA recent article by Australia Institute strategist Dan Cass in Meanjin, titled \"The Sun Rises: The democratization of solar energy might change everything,\" makes the case. The cost of solar power has decreased to the point where it's now as cheap as, or cheaper than, coal or gas. \"As late as 2007\", he writes, \"Australia had only about 8,000 solar systems in total. As of June 1, 2016, there were more than 1,548,345.\"\n\nGlobally, it's a similar story. According to a Frankfurt School of Finance and Management report, in 2015, for the first time, renewables made up the majority of newly built electricity-generation capacity. Investment in renewable energy, at $265.8 billion, was more than double the $130 billion invested in fossil fuel power generation.\n\nCass declares that \"renewables have won the energy wars.\" Crucially, he argues, this isn't happening because of government intervention, but is in line with \"capitalism as usual\":\n\nAccording to this logic, we needn't worry too much about continuing with environmental campaigning. Naomi Klein was wrong. It's not, as she had it, \"capitalism vs. the climate,\" but rather capitalism for the climate. Put simply, technological developments mean that, while it may not yet be apparent, fossil fuels are dead in the ground.\n\nAll this is very comforting for those of us who have been alarmed by the headlong rush of global capitalism toward climate catastrophe. But just as with George W. Bush's arrogant imperial overreach, this kind of triumphalism is unlikely to end well.\n\nWHEN IT comes to the environment, we would do well to adopt the motto of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci: \"Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.\" There are some reasons to be hopeful about the possible transition of the global energy system to renewables. It's clear that such a transition now makes perfect sense, not only from a moral and social standpoint, but also economically.\n\nUnfortunately, in a chaotic, irrational system like capitalism, making sense doesn't count for much. And contrary to the comforting arguments of Cass and others, there's ample reason to think that relying on \"market forces\" to drive the change is a recipe for disaster.\n\nDespite recent gains, renewables still make up only a small fraction of global energy production. Electricity generated from renewable sources (excluding hydro) made up just 7 percent of the global total in 2015. Fossil fuels accounted for 80 percent. Even if investment in renewables continues to grow at its current rate, progress toward a new energy system will be slow. Given the mounting evidence of the damage already being done by global warming, that's something we can ill afford.\n\nThen there's the continuing power and influence of the fossil fuel industries. Cass' \"Kodak moment\" reference is cute. But to compare the situation facing big energy today to that of camera and film companies overtaken by digitization is to understate massively its centrality to the capitalist system globally.\n\nIt's not just that big energy has captured politicians, who might easily be won away from them if only there was a crackdown on corporate \"dark money.\" It's that in many countries, the capitalist state is dependent on fossil fuels--most obviously as a source of revenue, but more importantly as a means to maintain their position in the competitive global scramble for economic and military power.\n\nIt might make sense, in the long run, for countries such as Australia and the U.S. to become global leaders in renewables--giving them genuine \"energy independence\" and creating new and potentially lucrative export industries. But capitalists don't look at the world in terms of what makes sense in the long run. What matters to them are the profits they're making today.\n\nMaximizing profits means squeezing the most out of the resources at your disposal. This includes human and natural resources, as well as the productive infrastructure through which human labor is transformed into commodities for sale on global markets. And it means squeezing harder than your rivals.\n\nIn the case of both Australia and the U.S., fossil fuels are central to the productive infrastructure on which the wealth and power of their respective capitalist classes is based. Historically, a \"cheap and easy\" supply of energy sources such gas, coal and oil has boosted profits across the entire economy. Particularly in the context of the emergence of new global rivals such as China, this is a hard thing to give up on.\n\nDonald Trump's recent executive order on \"energy independence,\" which winds back restrictions on domestic fossil fuel production enacted under Obama, has commonly been referred to as a straightforward gift to U.S. mining and energy companies. There is an element of truth in that. But it's far from the whole story.\n\nBreathing new life into U.S. fossil fuel production is part of Trump's broader project of putting \"America first\" and attempting to see off the challenge posed by the rise of China. In fact, Trump has framed the entire issue of climate change in terms of the U.S.-China rivalry. In 2012, for example, he tweeted, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nThis is laughable. But it points to how a section of U.S. capital, personified by Trump, views the issue: not simply as a matter of the profits of the fossil fuel companies, but as something with ramifications for the economy as a whole and, by extension, the continued ability of the US to occupy top spot in the global imperialist pecking order.\n\nTrump isn't alone among recent U.S. presidents in wanting to boost the U.S.'s global competitiveness by exploiting its untapped reserves of fossil fuels. Obama may have presented himself as an enlightened crusader for sustainability, but he presided over an unprecedented boom in U.S. oil and gas production--driven largely by the environmentally damaging technique of fracking.\n\nTHERE ARE other problems with relying on market forces to drive a \"renewable revolution.\" One of those was highlighted in a recent issue of the Economist, under the tantalizing headline: \"Clean energy's dirty secret.\"\n\nThis wasn't, as you might think, a form of clickbait for coal industry executives or Australian politicians looking for a \"dirty\" centerfold spread on how wind farms and solar panels are bad for the environment. As a mouthpiece for the liberal wing of the Anglo-American bourgeoisie, the Economist is prepared to admit the benefits of moving toward a decarbonized global economy.\n\nThe \"dirty secret\" is that renewables are too cheap. \"It is no longer far-fetched,\" the magazine says, \"to think that the world is entering an era of clean, unlimited and cheap power.\" There is, however, \"a $20 trillion hitch\":\n\nThe problem, in other words, is that the rise of renewables is making it more difficult for big energy companies to make the kind of profits they're accustomed to. The Economist argues that this will create a drag on investment and make the transition to a sustainable energy system impossible without direct government intervention: \"Theoretically, if renewables were to make up 100 percent of the market, the wholesale price of electricity would fall to zero, deterring all new investment that was not completely subsidized.\"\n\nCass is right on one point. If we sit back and let the market rip, the rise of renewables could propel us into a situation of \"creative destruction\" in our energy systems. Contrary to what he implies, however, this isn't something to be welcomed.\n\nBig energy will not allow its profits to be whittled away. It will fight tooth and nail to stop the further deployment of renewables. And to the extent that they fail in this endeavor and profits begin to suffer because of it, companies will attempt to make up the shortfall by squeezing more out of their existing, creaky infrastructure and charging us more.\n\nIn his rush to declare \"mission accomplished,\" Cass doesn't give much attention to this side of the equation.\n\nThe rise of renewables is cause for hope. But the triumphalism of Cass and others--their confidence that we can sit back and let the market do its work--is a recipe for disaster.\n\nNow more than ever, we need to fight. We need to fight to challenge and disrupt the continuing power of the fossil fuel industry in the global economy and in politics. And we need to fight for an energy system that centers on human need, rather than private profit--one that can utilize the very latest in renewable technology to provide a cheap and reliable supply of energy to the benefit of all."}, "http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/09/help-food-insecure-employees/": {"title": "20 Ways to Help Your Employees Struggling with Food Insecurity and Hunger", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/09/help-food-insecure-employees/", "text": ""}, "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/24/us-germany-capitalism-idUSKBN0LS1AI20150224": {"title": "One in three Germans say capitalism to blame for poverty, hunger", "keywords": ["Germany", "US", "GERMANY", "CAPITALISM", "Germany", "Elections / Voting", "Society / Social Issues", "Western Europe", "Europe", "Government / Politics", "Euro Zone"], "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/24/us-germany-capitalism-idUSKBN0LS1AI20150224", "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Nearly a third of Germans believe that capitalism is the cause of poverty and hunger and a majority think true democracy is not possible under that economic system, according to a survey published on Tuesday by the Emnid polling institute for Berlin\u2019s Free University.\n\nThe poll of 1,400 people found that 59 percent of Germans in the formerly communist east consider communist and socialist ideals a good idea for society.

The question was: How bad would the Trump tax cut program be once it was unveiled?\n\nRushing to announce his plan before the end of his first 100 days in office, the one-page bullet point plan released by the White House was--like most of what Trump has done so far--short on details and long on grandiose pronouncements.\n\nIn its press release, the White House asserted that Trump's tax cut plan is \"good for the American people.\" The word they left out was \"some\"--as in \"good for some American people,\" those with the biggest bank accounts.\n\nAmong the most egregious proposals in the Trump proposal are:\n\n-- Reducing the number of individual income tax brackets from seven to three--paying at rates of 10, 25 and 35 percent;\n\n-- Slashing the tax rate for both large and small corporations to just 15 percent from the current top rate of 35 percent (which the vast majority of corporations never actually pay due to loopholes and shelters);\n\n-- Exempting corporations from paying taxes on foreign profits and instituting a special one-time reduced tax (though the rate has not been not disclosed) to try to lure companies who currently shelter profits in tax havens outside the U.S. (currently estimated at $2.6 trillion).\n\n-- Lowering the capital gains tax rate--paid primarily on the sale of stocks, bonds or property--from 23.8 percent to 20 percent by eliminating a 3.8 percent tax that currently funds the Affordable Care Act;\n\n-- Eliminating the inheritance tax, which is only paid by the richest households;\n\n-- Eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which is also aimed at the wealthy, making it \"harder for very rich individuals to game the tax system and pay less tax,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nIN A press conference outlining the bare-bones plan, Gary Cohn, the director of Trump's National Economic Council, touted the plan as \"the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986\" and \"one of the biggest tax cuts in American history.\"\n\n\"Significant\" is right: It's a significant giveaway to the rich and a significant attack on working and poor people.\n\nIf the plan ever becomes law--which is a big \"if\"--it will almost entirely benefit the already wealthy. Like conveniently enough, the man currently occupying the Oval Office and his super-rich children. As Mother Jones noted, based on Trump's leaked 2005 tax returns:\n\nNo wonder Trump wants to kill the alternative minimum tax now.\n\nOr there's the fact that Trump's plan would create a so-called \"pass-through\" tax cut for business income that is currently taxed at the business owners' individual income tax rates rather than the corporate rate. Under Trump's plan, the tax rate for this wealth would drop to 15 percent. (Americans for Tax Fairness notes that Trump himself has some 500 pass-through arrangements.)\n\nANY ONE of the Trump tax proposals would be a massive giveaway to the rich--and a subsequent reduction in revenue that will almost certainly mean future cuts in government spending for services and programs that working-class and poor people disproportionately rely on.\n\nReducing the number of individual tax brackets from seven to three would cost at least $1.5 trillion in revenue. Dropping the corporate tax rate would cost $3.7 trillion, and repealing the alternative minimum tax would cost $0.4 trillion.\n\nOverall, the New York Times reported, \"Trump's proposed changes to the tax code could increase the deficit by an estimated $3 trillion to $7 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing deficits.\"\n\nYet when he and Cohn announced the plan last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had the nerve to assert that Trump's tax cut plan would \"pay for itself\" through increased economic growth.\n\nThe Trump administration is also claiming the tax plan would benefit the middle class, with Cohn telling CBS This Morning, \"We're eliminating the deductions that were added to the tax legislation over the years to favor the wealthy. The wealthy have deductions. Middle-income people and lower-income people don't have deductions.\"\n\nBut as Vox's Dylan Matthews wrote, \"There just aren't enough deductions in the tax code to make Trump's plan anything other than a giveaway to the wealthy.\"\n\nBut that is wishful thinking, to say the least. If there's one thing that history has shown about tax cuts for the rich, it's that they don't translate into increased investment and a booming economy. To use the words of former President George H.W. Bush, that kind of thinking is \"voodoo economics,\" as he famously termed Ronald Reagan's tax cut plan before becoming Reagan's vice president.\n\nTRUMP'S PLAN amounts to \"Goldman Sachs populism,\" Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, said in a statement. He added that there \"is zero rationale for cutting corporate taxes and zero reason to think that lower taxes will generate more investment.\"\n\nBecause the plan is so short on actual details, the full scope of the giveaway isn't clear.\n\nFor example, the incentive for companies that currently shelter their profits abroad to bring that money back to the U.S. would have to be staggeringly high. The tech giant Apple currently keeps much of its earnings abroad, but then borrows money from its foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends and make new investments. As the Times notes, \"because the interest paid on loans is also deductible, Apple ends up reaping a second tax benefit.\"\n\nA lower rate to attract hoarded corporate profits would have be a giant bonanza to make it worthwhile.\n\nAll of this is par for the course in America's tax system--which overwhelmingly benefits the rich at the expense of those who rely on government spending and services.\n\nAccording to Trump and Co., there's no money to fund public television or libraries anymore, no money for public housing, none for education or any number of other important programs and agencies whose budgets are now on the chopping block.\n\nBut there's enough to put more money in the pockets of the rich at a time when income inequality is at staggering levels and America is wracked by a deep social crisis that is causing the immiseration of working and poor people.\n\nThe U.S. tax system already lets the rich get away with murder while penalizing working people and the poor. And Trump wants make the imbalance even greater.\n\nDEMOCRATS WILL try to make political hay out of Trump's attempt at such massive giveaways to the already wealthy.\n\nBut as horrendous as Trump's tax plan is, it has to be pointed out that it was eight years of the Obama administration and the Democrats' own push for giveaways to Corporate America that set the stage for Trump's plan today.\n\nBack in 2013, Barack Obama's \"grand bargain\" included a proposed tax plan that would have lowered the overall corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent and lowered the effective corporate tax rate for manufacturers to 25 percent in exchange for some job creation programs. Despite his earlier promises, Obama proposed the changes without any push to raise taxes on high-income individuals.\n\nAs the New York Times noted at the time, the danger was that \"while the proposal would raise money for useful purposes in the short run, it would amount to an unjustified corporate giveaway in the longer term\"--and that it was \"fine in theory but difficult in practice, and especially so because neither the president nor anyone in Congress has specified which tax breaks would be curbed to pay for lower rates.\"\n\nAs Lance Selfa reported for SocialistWorker.org at the time, Obama's push for a \"grand bargain\" was premised on the idea of accepting cuts to vital social services and entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare in exchange for a Republican agreement to some limited increases in other taxes:\n\nIn 2015, Obama proposed his own version of the corporate tax holiday--a one-time, 14 percent tax on the estimated $2.1 trillion in profits piled up overseas by multinationals like Apple, and a 19 percent tax on U.S. companies' future foreign earnings, far below the supposed corporate tax rate.\n\nYet that wasn't enough of a giveaway for the Republicans and Corporate America.\n\nINEQUALITY IN America is at unprecedented levels. In our new \"gilded age,\" the top 1 percent of households earn an average of $1.3 million a year--more than three times as much as in the 1980s, economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman reported in December.\n\nAt the same time, average pre-tax national income per person for the bottom 50 percent of the population was $16,000 in 1980--a figure that hasn't changed substantially in more than 30 years. For Millennials born in the 1980s, there's now only a 50 percent chance that they will earn more than their parents did.\n\nWith the chief advocate for the new robber barons sitting in the White House, we can expect the picture to get bleaker unless there is a united, organized resistance that not only rejects giveaways to the rich and demands full funding of the programs and services ordinary people need, but that also holds the Democrats to account as they attempt to make deals with Trump.\n\nThe rich should be forced to pay their share--but whether they will depends on whether we can build the kind of fighting movement that rejects the scapegoating of the poor and links up the struggles of working people and others to stand firm against Trump's priorities of profits and power."}, "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-inequality-idUSKBN150009?il=0": {"title": "World's eight richest as wealthy as half humanity, Oxfam tells Davos", "keywords": ["China", "India", "Mexico", "Amancio Ortega", "Bill Gates", "Carlos Slim", "Jeff Bezos", "Larry Ellison", "Mark Zuckerberg", "MAX LAWSON", "Michael Bloomberg", "Warren Buffett", "US", "DAVOS", "MEETING", "INEQUALITY", "Chemicals (Legacy)", "Apparel and Accessories Retailers (TRBC)", "Western Europe", "Arts / Culture / Entertainment", "Taxation", "Software (TRBC)", "Asia / Pacific", "Major News", "Government Borrowing Requirement", "Apparel and Accessories (TRBC)", "Department Stores (TRBC)", "United Kingdom", "United States", "IT Services and Consulting (TRBC)", "Wealth Management", "Switzerland", "Company News", "India", "Financials (TRBC)", "Financials (Legacy)", "Government / Politics", "Corporate Events", "Spain", "Economic Events", "Banking and Investment Services (TRBC)", "Internet / World Wide Web", "Europe", "Science", "Emerging Market Countries", "Industrial Machinery / Equipment (Legacy)"], "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-inequality-idUSKBN150009?il=0", "text": "DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Just eight individuals, all men, own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population, Oxfam said on Monday in a report calling for action to curtail rewards for those at the top.\n\nAs decision makers and many of the super-rich gather for this week\u2019s World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, the charity\u2019s report suggests the wealth gap is wider than ever, with new data for China and India indicating that the poorest half of the world owns less than previously estimated.\n\nOxfam, which described the gap as \u201cobscene\u201d, said if the new data had been available before, it would have shown that in 2016 nine people owned the same as the 3.6 billion who make up the poorest half of humanity, rather than 62 estimated at the time.\n\nIn 2010, by comparison, it took the combined assets of the 43 richest people to equal the wealth of the poorest 50 percent, according to the latest calculations.\n\nInequality has moved up the agenda in recent years, with the head of the International Monetary Fund and the Pope among those warning of its corrosive effects, while resentment of elites has helped fuel an upsurge in populist politics.\n\nConcern about the issue was highlighted again in the WEF\u2019s own global risks report last week.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of hand-wringing - and clearly Trump\u2019s victory and Brexit gives that new impetus this year - but there is a lack of concrete alternatives to business as usual,\u201d said Max Lawson, Oxfam\u2019s head of policy.\n\n\u201cThere are different ways of running capitalism that could be much, much more beneficial to the majority of people.\u201d\n\nOxfam called in its report for a crackdown on tax dodging and a shift away from \u201csuper-charged\u201d shareholder capitalism that pays out disproportionately to the rich.\n\nWhile many workers struggle with stagnating incomes, the wealth of the super-rich has increased by an average of 11 percent a year since 2009.\n\nBill Gates, the world\u2019s richest man who is a regular at Davos, has seen his fortune rise by 50 percent or $25 billion since announcing plans to leave Microsoft in 2006, despite his efforts to give much of it away.\n\nWhile Gates exemplifies how outsized wealth can be recycled to help the poor, Oxfam believes such \u201cbig philanthropy\u201d does not address the fundamental problem.\n\n\u201cIf billionaires choose to give their money away then that is a good thing.

In the United States, it has found its most striking success in reducing homelessness among military veterans in cities like New Orleans, Salt Lake City and Phoenix. But no country has embraced the approach as firmly as Canada.\n\nAnd nowhere in Canada has as much progress been made as in Medicine Hat, a small energy-rich city on the South Saskatchewan River. In November 2015, the city declared that it had succeeded in ending homelessness, bringing accolades and attention from all over the world.\n\nBut Medicine Hat\u2019s claim points to the fuzzy logic of the problem: The end of homelessness is a state, not a moment. There will always be people who become homeless, and there will always be people who prefer to remain homeless, even in Medicine Hat.\n\n\u201cI like moving around \u2014 I can\u2019t explain it,\u201d said Gordon Thompson, a cheerful homeless man of 72, sitting in a Medicine Hat Salvation Army day room where clusters of people gather to pass the time and get a hot meal. He jokes with the caseworkers who come by imploring him to accept a home but stays instead in shelters or on the street, one among a hard-core cohort that shuns assistance.\n\nAs elsewhere in the world, Canada\u2019s homelessness problem grew in recent decades as rising rents pushed the country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens into the streets. The oil boom fed the real estate bubble in Alberta.\n\nCalgary, the center of Alberta\u2019s energy industry, had the worst homelessness in the province. In 2006, the province gave the city money to test the housing first approach, which had been pioneered more than a decade earlier by a Canadian psychologist, Sam Tsemberis, while he was working in New York.\n\nWith parallel projects popping up in British Columbia and Ontario, the Mental Health Commission of Canada got involved, lobbying for federal money to study the strategy. The commission started a clinical trial in five cities across Canada \u2014 Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton \u2014 in which 2,200 homeless people with either mental illness or an addiction were randomly assigned to either housing first or treatment as usual.\n\nThe results were startling, validating the housing first model and showing that the cost of housing the homeless was far less than the cost of the emergency services needed by the homeless while they were living on the street.\n\n\u201cThe reduction in days in jail alone pays for the program,\u201d said Jaime Rogers, a Medicine Hat housing official. She cited studies that said the average homeless person costs taxpayers 120,000 Canadian dollars a year, or $91,600, in services, while it costs just 18,000 Canadian dollars a year, or $13,740, to house someone and provide the necessary retention support.\n\nThat kind of evidence persuaded the conservative government of former Prime Minister Stephen Harper to pursue housing first as a national policy.\n\n\u201cThis is where it went to a scale that I have not seen in any other country,\u201d Dr. Tsemberis said in a telephone interview.\n\nUnder Canada\u2019s subsequent Homeless Partnering Strategy, the federal government now distributes about 176 million Canadian dollars a year, or about $134 million, among 61 communities to fund services for the homeless. About 40 percent of that money must be spent on housing first interventions.\n\nSeven Alberta cities \u2014 Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge, Grande Prairie, Red Deer, Wood Buffalo and Medicine Hat \u2014 formed a loose coalition and in 2007 each wrote its own 10-year plan to end homelessness. The province now spends more than 83 million Canadian dollars, or about $63 million, a year to carry out the plans, and came up with a 10-year plan of its own.\n\nProgress has been promising. In 2014, when Alberta conducted a \u201cpoint in time\u201d count \u2014 giving a snapshot of people who are homeless on a particular night \u2014 the total in the seven cities studied was 6,663. In 2016, the number had fallen nearly 20 percent, to 5,378.\n\nResults in Medicine Hat were even more striking: The number of homeless counted fell by nearly half to 33 from 61. The number of participants in the housing first program, meanwhile, doubled to 120.\n\nMedicine Hat leapt ahead, in part, because the problem is more manageable here. It is easier to deal with homelessness in a town of 63,000, where social workers know the names of almost everyone who is down and out. It is also easier when members from the agencies working on the problem are so few that they can sit down around a table.\n\nBut Medicine Hat has another advantage that could point the way for other cities: a centralized office that manages both housing stock and support programs. The Homeless and Housing Development Department of the Medicine Hat Community Housing Society is led by Ms. Rogers.\n\nRecognizing that some people will always lose their homes, and with no national consensus of what \u201cending homelessness\u201d means, Ms. Rogers and her team came up with their own definition: In Medicine Hat, it means connecting anyone identified as homeless with a caseworker and putting him or her on a waiting list for a housing program within 10 days.\n\nThat turned out to be a stroke of public relations genius, because when they reached their goal, word that Medicine Hat had \u201cended homelessness\u201d ricocheted from Argentina to Germany to Japan. The once-skeptical mayor, whose office plays only a marginal role in the plan, has since given as many as 200 interviews on the subject to news media from all over the world.\n\nThe question, of course, is: How long do people remain homeless before being housed? Because of adequate federal and provincial funding and a good supply of local housing, few people in Medicine Hat remain truly homeless for more than a few months, Ms. Rogers said.\n\nShe added that it took time to help homeless people get their papers straightened out and arrange for government assistance. Then, they are offered at least three potential homes. Some prefer to wait in a shelter until they are happy with what is available.\n\nMs. Rogers said it cost less in the long run if the process was slow and deliberate because the goal is to house people permanently rather than rush them to unsuitable housing and have them return to the street.\n\nOf course, a housing first strategy in larger cities becomes exponentially more complex, cautioned Dr. Stefan Kertesz, an associate professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, who has studied housing first challenges in the United States.\n\nOnly some major metropolitan centers are equipped with the leadership, manpower or structure necessary to coordinate a multiagency effort.\n\n\u201cCities with tight housing markets need a very substantial amount of work, both in terms of front-line staff and organizational leadership, put toward recruiting landlords and even rehabbing buildings,\u201d Dr. Kertesz said by email. \u201cIt means a major organizational undertaking with all pistons firing.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, there is now a move to define on a national scale what it means to end homelessness, providing a benchmark for success.\n\nAlina Turner, a fellow at the University of Calgary\u2019s School of Public Policy and one of the lead researchers pushing for a definition, said current programs should aim for \u201cfunctional zero,\u201d which recognizes that there will always be some people without homes.\n\nUnder the currently proposed definition, functional zero would mean a 90 percent decrease in people experiencing homelessness in a community.\n\n\u201cHousing is the easy part,\u201d said Ms. Rogers, who acknowledged that by Dr. Turner\u2019s definition, Medicine Hat still had a way to go. \u201cKeeping them housed will always be the difficult part.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Mr. Remple, sitting in his sparsely furnished apartment, said this was the fifth place he had lived in during the five years since he connected with the housing first program.\n\n\u201cI kept taking in homeless friends,\u201d he said blankly. \u201cI\u2019d have two or four people living and drinking and partying with me until I\u2019d get evicted.\u201d\n\nFrustrating as such people might be, most eventually manage to settle down, social workers say. The stability of a home allows people to gradually address their problems.\n\nMr. Remple\u2019s caseworker, Allysa Larmor, said he had been sober since January and seems determined to change his ways. She has helped mediate with his landlord and connect him with services like addiction counseling and a food bank, and she will soon start working with him on developing \u201cmeaningful daily activities\u201d to fill the time that was once taken up drinking."}, "http://www.socialistalternative.org/2016/11/11/anti-trump-protests-24-hours-40000-people-answered-call/": {"title": "Anti-Trump Protests: In less than 24 hours 40,000 people answered our call!", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.socialistalternative.org/2016/11/11/anti-trump-protests-24-hours-40000-people-answered-call/", "text": "The unthinkable has happened \u2013 Donald Trump has won.

Or do most Americans deeply value tolerance and inclusivity? The answer to this question may well decide the election this fall, so we decided to crunch the numbers. The data suggests that like so much in our changing society, your perspective depends on where you sit. And one key source of this divide is perceptions of continued discrimination in our society.\n\nTo explore views about political correctness, we used the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 pilot survey, a 1,200 person survey performed in January of this year.1 ANES includes two questions that ask respondents if they think society needs to change the way it talks to be more sensitive to people from different backgrounds or if society has gone too far and people are too easily offended. There are two slightly differently worded questions on the same topic that are each asked to half of the respondents chosen at random.2 We combined the two questions and then examined people who said society needs to be \u201ca lot\u201d and \u201ca little\u201d more sensitive, and then separately those who said society is \u201ca lot\u201d and \u201ca little\u201d too easily offended. ANES also asks respondents how much discrimination they think there is against a number of groups on a scale of 1 to 5, with blacks being one of the groups. We combined responses of \u201ca great deal\u201d and \u201ca lot\u201d of discrimination, \u201ca little\u201d and \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of discrimination, and \u201cno discrimination at all.\u201d\n\nWe find that those who believe society is becoming overly politically correct also tend to believe there is less discrimination in society against African-Americans. We also find they are less likely to say there is discrimination against gays and lesbians. The chart below shows how much discrimination respondents perceive against African-Americans based on their views on more \u201cpolitically correct\u201d or inclusive language.\n\nTwenty-eight percent of respondents (and 32 percent of white respondents) say that African-Americans face \u201ca little\u201d or \u201cno\u201d discrimination despite overwhelming evidence and personal accounts of blatant discrimination on a daily basis against groups based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other identities. One study finds that \u201cJohn\u201d will be offered $4,000 more than \u201cJennifer\u201d for the same job. Another finds that resumes with white-sounding names are more likely to be asked for an interview than identical resumes with black-sounding names.\n\nSomewhat unsurprisingly, there are strong racial divides on the question of political correctness, with whites more likely to say that \u201cpeople are too easily offended:\u201d 71% of whites, compared to only 34% of blacks and 42% of all people of color agree with this. We also find that those who faced discrimination based on their skin color are more likely to support changing language norms, and this holds true even among only people of color (which ensures the result doesn\u2019t merely reflect racial differences in views on political correctness)\n\nOptimistically though, these data indicate that the reverse is also true: those who recognize that there is a great deal of discrimination against blacks are more likely to believe society needs to become more sensitive. The chart below shows that whites who say that blacks face \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of discrimination are more likely to say language needs to change.\n\nAlso optimistically, whites who recognize that there is a great deal of discrimination against blacks are much more likely to believe that society needs to become more inclusive than whites who deny racial bias.\n\nThe data are clear: those who acknowledge that discrimination exists and have experienced it themselves think society needs to become more sensitive to people from different backgrounds. Those who haven\u2019t, don\u2019t. The majority of people who believe society is overly politically correct, then, are likely speaking from their own lived experience: they may not have experienced discrimination or may not think it occurs much, so when people take offense, they believe society is simply being too sensitive.\n\nThese differences of opinion are certainly important, but at some point the question of how inclusive the dominant society must be to the concerns of different people will have to move beyond the realm of personal preference. The racial and gender anxiety shuddering through this election shows that this time may have come. The United States is becoming a truly pluralistic nation, with residents and citizens who have roots in every community on the globe, and more individuals are demanding to express their gender and sexuality as they feel it. That diversity can be our greatest asset as a nation, but only if we forge a common understanding of the discrimination that exists, and a language that works for all of us."}, "https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/12/if-this-is-true-nothing-else-really-matters": {"title": "If This Is True, Nothing Else Really Matters | Current Affairs", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/12/if-this-is-true-nothing-else-really-matters", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, recently gave one of the more ominous comments I\u2019ve heard about North Korea. Asked by the BBC whether the administration was committed to a peaceful resolution of the situation, McMaster replied:\n\nWe\u2019re not committed to a peaceful [resolution] \u2013 we\u2019re committed to a resolution. We want the resolution to be peaceful, but as the president has said, all options are on the table and we have to be prepared, if necessary, to compel the denuclearisation of North Korea without the cooperation of that regime.\n\nMcMaster has said, then, that unless the North Koreans give up their nuclear weapons, \u201cdenuclearization\u201d will be \u201ccompel[led].\u201d There is very little likelihood that North Korea will voluntarily give up their weapons. \u201cCompulsion,\u201d then, seems a genuine possibility.\n\nEvery scenario that involves direct military action against North Korea has catastrophic outcomes. The New Yorker spoke to retired Major General James Marks, who commented that in any conflict: \u201cThe devastation to the peninsula would be disastrous, just disastrous\u2026 There would be horrendous loss of life. There are twenty-five million people in South Korea within artillery range of North Korea.\u201d In 2015, the U.S. Congressional estimate was that North Korea had 10-16 nuclear weapons. Now, some experts put the number as high as 60. Each of these can obliterate a city in an instant. But nuclear weapons are only part of the problem. Strategic intelligence analysts at Stratfor have concluded that North Korea\u2019s \u201cmost powerful tool is artillery\u201d; the DPRK has a vast buildup of heavy conventional weaponry positioned along the border, including \u201can estimated 12,000 pieces of tube artillery and another 2,300 multiple launch rocket systems.\u201d Even worse, North Korea may possess significant quantities of biological and chemical weapons. There is evidence that the country has a biological weapons development program, though the status of that program is largely unknown. There are firmer estimates about chemical weapons: the Center for Nonproliferation Studies has suggested that North Korea possesses \u201cbetween 2,500 and 5,000 metric tons of chemical weapons,\u201d including a large supply of VX, \u201cthe deadliest nerve agent ever created.\u201d\n\nGiven these facts, combined with the very serious risk that any U.S. military action would trigger immediate escalation toward all-out nuclear war, a peaceful resolution to the crisis is imperative. Even Steve Bannon understood this. He explicitly ruled out the idea of a military solution, realizing that the cost in human life would make any such move an act of pure murderous insanity:\n\nThere\u2019s no military solution [to North Korea\u2019s nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don\u2019t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s no military solution here, they got us.\n\nIt\u2019s alarming, then, that McMaster has said he isn\u2019t committed to a peaceful resolution, but \u201ca resolution.\u201d\n\nWorse, there\u2019s evidence that this isn\u2019t just rhetoric. Yesterday, The Telegraph issued an exclusive report that the United States, believing diplomatic options may have been exhausted, is actively preparing to attack North Korea:\n\nAmerica is drawing up plans for a \u201cbloody nose\u201d military attack on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons programme, The Telegraph understands. The White House has \u201cdramatically\u201d stepped up preparation for a military solution in recent months amid fears diplomacy is not working, well-placed sources said. Three sources \u2013 two former US officials familiar with current thinking and a third figure in the administration \u2013 confirmed military options were being worked up. The Pentagon is trying to find options that would allow them to punch the North Koreans in the nose\u2026\n\nIf The Telegraph\u2018s reporting is correct, this is the most important news story of the moment. Compared to the possibility of war with North Korea, everything else looks insignificant. This has potentially more serious consequences for human lives than anything else going on right now.\n\nI am phrasing that with deliberate caution, though. The Telegraph\u2018s story relies on anonymous sources, two who do not actually work in the administration and one who does. It\u2019s always difficult to figure out who has reliable access to the truth. Furthermore, because international relations is frequently an elaborate and potentially genocidal game of \u201cchicken,\u201d disinformation is common. H.R. McMaster may privately have reached the same conclusion as Steve Bannon, but believe that the U.S. needs to appear serious. I don\u2019t know. None of us knows what is actually going on, because it\u2019s a secret known only to people at the very top of the United States government.\n\nI can think of half a dozen good reasons why we should believe the U.S. might take sudden military action against North Korea, though. The first and most obvious is the personality of Donald Trump. Kim Jong Un has adopted the strategy of deliberately taunting Trump by increasing his nuclear tests, and Trump is not a man who likes to be humiliated. But there are also some concerning new factual developments. For one thing, \u201cthough December is normally rather quiet for military drills, the US this month brought in a record number of stealth aircraft to train up on an air war against North Korea.\u201d Ten days ago it was reported that China has begun to plan new refugee camps along the North Korean border, suggesting it sees war as a real possibility. China has also apparently distributed printed advice for how to survive a nuclear attack to residents along the border. Business Insider says that \u201cthe US and China are preparing for all hell to break loose in North Korea.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tough to know how to think about the risk of war here. We have been in a state of tension for so long that, however risky the situation may look on paper, it is hard to actually imagine there being a Second Korean War (or rather, a continuation of the first Korean War, since it never actually ended). The nuclear threat is strange, because all of us simultaneously know it\u2019s real and find it impossible to actually imagine. We pretend it isn\u2019t there despite knowing full well that it is.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t understand, though, is why American news outlets aren\u2019t spending more time on North Korea. As the British Telegraph was reporting that the United States is literally making plans for an attack, the New York Times was spending its time on such pressing matters as an Atlantic writer going on a social media break and the question of whether Jesus was born under a palm tree. On the entire Times homepage this morning I found just one reference to North Korea, a tiny headline near the bottom of the page about a low-ranking DPRK soldier defecting across the border.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t like it when journalists scaremonger either. If CNN were doing nothing but hosting panels of experts speculating on when the U.S. was going to strike North Korea, goading Trump into action, that\u2026 wouldn\u2019t be good either. The last thing we want is the kind of media-fueled \u201cwar fever\u201d that overtook the country in 2003.\n\nBut I do wish someone would tell me what was going on. Because if this goes wrong, it will make everything else look trivial.\n\nIf you appreciate our work, please consider making a donation or purchasing a subscription.

Just 42 percent said they support it.\n\nIt isn't clear that the young people in the poll would prefer some alternative system, though. Just 33 percent said they supported socialism. The survey had a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points.\n\nThe results of the survey are difficult to interpret, pollsters noted. Capitalism can mean different things to different people, and the newest generation of voters is frustrated with the status quo, broadly speaking.\n\nAll the same, that a majority of respondents in Harvard University's survey of young adults said they do not support capitalism suggests that today's youngest voters are more focused on the flaws of free markets.\n\n\"The word 'capitalism' doesn't mean what it used to,\" said Zach Lustbader, a senior at Harvard involved in conducting the poll, which was published Monday. For those who grew up during the Cold War, capitalism meant freedom from the Soviet Union and other totalitarian regimes. For those who grew up more recently, capitalism has meant a financial crisis from which the global economy still hasn't completely recovered.\n\n[Bernie Sanders is profoundly changing how millennials think about politics]\n\nA subsequent survey that included people of all ages found that somewhat older Americans also are skeptical of capitalism. Only among respondents at least 50 years old was the majority in support of capitalism.\n\nAlthough the results are startling, Harvard's questions accord with other recent research on how Americans think about capitalism and socialism. In 2011, for example, the Pew Research Center found that people ages 18 to 29 were frustrated with the free-market system.\n\nIn that survey, 46 percent had positive views of capitalism, and 47 percent had negative views \u2014 a broader question than what Harvard's pollsters asked, which was whether the respondent supported the system. With regard to socialism, by contrast, 49 percent of the young people in Pew's poll had positive views, and just 43 percent had negative views.\n\nLustbader, 22, said the darkening mood on capitalism is evident in the way politicians talk about the economy. When Republicans \u2014 long the champions of free enterprise \u2014 use the word \"capitalism\" these days, it's often to complain about \"crony capitalism,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't hear people on the right defending their economic policies using that word anymore,\" Lustbader added.\n\nIt is an open question whether young people's attitudes on socialism and capitalism show that they are rejecting free markets as a matter of principle or whether those views are simply an expression of broader frustrations with an economy in which household incomes have been declining for 15 years.\n\nOn specific questions about how best to organize the economy, for example, young people's views seem conflicted. Just 27 percent believe government should play a large role in regulating the economy, the Harvard poll found, and just 30 percent think the government should play a large role in reducing income inequality. Only 26 percent said government spending is an effective way to increase economic growth\n\nYet 48 percent agreed that \"basic health insurance is a right for all people.\" And 47 percent agreed with the statement that \"Basic necessities, such as food and shelter, are a right that the government should provide to those unable to afford them.\"\n\n\"Young people could be saying that there are problems with capitalism, contradictions,\" Frank Newport, the editor in chief of Gallup, said when asked about the new data. \"I certainly don't know what\u2019s going through their heads.\"\n\nJohn Della Volpe, the polling director at Harvard, went on to personally interview a small group of young people about their attitudes toward capitalism to try to learn more. They told him that capitalism was unfair and left people out despite their hard work.\n\n\"They're not rejecting the concept,\" Della Volpe said. \"The way in which capitalism is practiced today, in the minds of young people \u2014 that's what they're rejecting.\"\n\nWhy the poor do better on these simple tests of financial common sense\n\nThe irony of putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill\n\nThe secret to why money is so good at changing people's minds"}, "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/realestate/so-you-think-your-place-is-small.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0": {"title": "So You Think Your Place Is Small?", "keywords": ["Williamsburg (Brooklyn  NY)", "Real Estate and Housing (Residential)", "Renting and Leasing (Real Estate)", "New York City", "Music", "Leahy  Jack"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/realestate/so-you-think-your-place-is-small.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0", "text": "\u201cThat label was the reason I moved to New York,\u201d said Mr. Leahy, a pop/minimalist composer who goes by the name Socrates. Mr. Leahy is proficient on keyboards, synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers. \u201cI mix and record everything on an old reel-to-reel tape machine,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Leahy must keep quiet during rehearsals in the performance space below him, which can be any time between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week. Fortunately, the Wi-Fi is great, so he can always watch soccer matches if he doesn\u2019t feel like reading. He\u2019s also required to maintain a ghostly profile in the kitchen and office in the back of the building, which is where the bathroom is. It has a shower, in case you were wondering.\n\nDespite the restrictions, Mr. Leahy faced fierce competition and had to woo his way into his cubbyhole. His ex-girlfriend, an artist, told him about the unorthodox residence and referred him to the landlords, who were swayed, he said, by his \u201cvery long, thoughtful, funny, charming email\u201d that described, in detail, his minimal grocery storage needs.\n\nHe took the space sight unseen and insists that he had no misgivings when he arrived.\n\n\u201cI think I was happy to be in New York and that I actually had a place,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \u201cIt was just kind of comical. It is comical. Whenever I show people where I live, they always laugh.\u201d\n\nHe awakens many mornings to the sounds of experimental theater: strange clanging, performers speaking in gibberish, chants. The space is ovenlike in the summer, cozy in winter.\n\nAnd though he doesn\u2019t see much of them, he likes his quasi-roommates: seven other artists and creative types who live in the warren of more traditional rooms at the back of the building. \u201cThough I\u2019m always jealous when I see them sitting on chairs in their rooms,\u201d he admits.\n\nOccasionally, there are parties in the building \u2014 and not just any parties, really good ones \u2014 \u201cthe kind of thing you\u2019d imagine happening in Bushwick or Ridgewood,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are some serious drawbacks, of course. The door behind his bed opens onto a sheer drop into the performance space, which gave him a scare a few months back when he leaned against it and felt it moving. Nor does he recommend nights of heavy drinking or hosting visitors, especially if romance is in the cards.\n\n\u201cThings get intimate really fast. You basically can\u2019t do anything but lie down,\u201d Mr. Leahy warned. \u201cAt the same time, too much moving around up here doesn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, he recently decided to stay for another year. Romantic rendezvous chez Leahy are not a concern at the moment. He got back together with his girlfriend, the one who told him about the crawl space, and she lives in a nearby studio \u2014 a proper one, with windows and more than enough clearance to walk upright.\n\nAnd while some people might find even a good-size studio cramped for two, Mr. Leahy is not one of them.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt feels like a great hall.\u201d"}, "https://www.apnews.com/9b851a1615434bd8b76fcaefdc0abc91/The-Latest:-US-backed-Syrian-force-attacks-IS-held-Raqqa": {"title": "The Latest: US says fight for Raqqa will be 'difficult'", "keywords": ["AP Top News", "International News", "Middle East", "Islamic State group", "Syria", "Iraq"], "url": "https://www.apnews.com/9b851a1615434bd8b76fcaefdc0abc91/The-Latest:-US-backed-Syrian-force-attacks-IS-held-Raqqa", "text": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the conflict in Syria (all times local):\n\nA U.S. military official says the offensive against the Islamic State group's de facto capital, Raqqa \"will be long and difficult.\"\n\nLt.

In a story published last night, we\u2019re told that there\u2019s a growing sense of urgency, with the headline, \u201cAs North Korea Speeds Its Nuclear Program, U.S. Fears Time Will Run Out.\u201d\n\nBy the third paragraph the story is already imagining a hypothetical strike against a US city, in a scenario that we\u2019ve heard off and on since the late 1990s whenever it\u2019s politically expedient:\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be the last time that the article cites this outrageous hypothetical that North Korea could strike US cities. The New York Times even drops in the possibility of North Korea hitting New York \u201cone day.\u201d\n\nAgain, this might be a good time to pause and think about your feelings on North Korea a few months ago. Was the country an existential threat to you then? If you\u2019re feeling more inclined to support a preemptive war against North Korea, as Trump has said is now a very real possibility, what changed? Was it reading an article that said North Korea could one day, possibly, maybe hit the United States with a nuclear weapon?\n\nOr, take this story from Fox News published yesterday. We\u2019re told that military victory in North Korea would be easy, according to \u201cexperts.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re old enough to remember the invasion of Iraq in 2003, you\u2019ll recall that Americans were also sold on the idea that victory would be easy. Notably, the piece never mentions or considers what happens after you \u201cdefeat\u201d an enemy like Iraq or North Korea.\n\nNumber of mentions of civilian casualties in the Fox News article? Zero. Number of mentions of the inevitable humanitarian crisis? Zero. Number of mentions of the likely counterinsurgency campaign that could last untold numbers of years? Zero.\n\nAt least we haven\u2019t gotten to the part yet where Americans are being told that North Koreans will welcome us as liberators. They said that about Iraq, and it turned out to not be the case\u2014in a very major way.\n\nIn North Korea, every person is taught from childhood that the United States and Japan are the most evil countries on the planet. Something tells me that North Korea\u2019s standing army of 1.3 million troops won\u2019t greet American or Japanese forces as liberators. Even if North Korea\u2019s elite dictatorship were wiped away with a magic wand tomorrow, it\u2019s difficult to predict how the populace would react.\n\nIn order for the United States to strike North Korea, the Trump regime hypothetically needs buy-in from three places: the international community, Congress, and the American people.\n\nWhen it comes to the international community, Trump has more or less gotten permission to do whatever he wants from allies like Australia and Japan. In fact, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is expected to meet face-to-face with Donald Trump for the first time as early as next week. The temporary caretaker government in South Korea doesn\u2019t want war, but it\u2019s easier than ever for Trump to push them around, at least until elections are held on May 9th. And State Department Secretary Tillerson is reportedly charing a special meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe meeting will give Security Council members an opportunity to discuss ways to maximize the impact of existing Security Council measures and show their resolve to respond to further provocations with appropriate new measures,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said yesterday.\n\nAs for Congress, they\u2019re going to get the hard-nosed sales pitch from the Trump regime this week. All one hundred US Senators are meeting at the White House on Wednesday morning for a classified briefing by Defense Secretary Jim \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford, State Department Secretary Rex Tillerson, and the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats. A similar briefing is being planned for members of the House.\n\nAnd lastly, there\u2019s the American public, who need to be persuaded that North Korea is a threat to the American way of life through the media. Again, we\u2019re seeing that happening in real time as news stories that are eerily reminiscent of past wars rear their ugly head.\n\nI don\u2019t know the future. I have no idea if the United States is going to invade North Korea or drop bombs on Kim Jong-un\u2019s brutal regime. But the stars are aligning this week for a slick sales job, just as we saw in 2003 before the invasion of Iraq. And that should scare the hell out of anyone who believes that the US and its allies have very little to gain and a lot to lose by starting a war (nuclear or otherwise) on the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe next time you read a story about North Korea or see something about the country on TV, simply ask yourself what changed? Did North Korea become a tangible threat to the safety and security of the United States in just a few short months? Or are you being sold on the idea of a war?\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, and you were duped into believing that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a good idea, maybe take a moment to reflect on what we\u2019re being sold today. The lives of a lot of people in South Korea, Japan, North Korea and maybe even the US and China depend on what we decide to do next."}, "https://www.thenation.com/article/noam-chomsky-neoliberalism-destroying-democracy/": {"title": "Noam Chomsky: Neoliberalism Is Destroying Our Democracy", "keywords": ["Neoliberalism"], "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/noam-chomsky-neoliberalism-destroying-democracy/", "text": "For 50 years, Noam Chomsky, has been America\u2019s Socrates, our public pest with questions that sting. He speaks not to the city square of Athens but to a vast global village in pain and now, it seems, in danger. This interview comes from Open Source with Christopher Lydon, a weekly program about arts, ideas and politics. Listen to rest of the conversation with Chomsky here.\n\nThe world in trouble today still beats a path to Noam Chomsky\u2019s door, if only because he\u2019s been forthright for so long about a whirlwind coming. Not that the world quite knows what do with Noam Chomsky\u2019s warnings of disaster in the making. Remember the famous faltering of the patrician TV host William F. Buckley Jr., meeting Chomsky\u2019s icy anger about the war in Vietnam, in 1969.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing about Noam Chomsky: The New York Times calls him \u201carguably\u201d the most important public thinker alive, though the paper seldom quotes him, or argues with him, and giant pop-media stars on network television almost never do. And yet the man is universally famous and revered in his 89th year: He\u2019s the scientist who taught us to think of human language as something embedded in our biology, not a social acquisition; he\u2019s the humanist who railed against the Vietnam War and other projections of American power, on moral grounds first, ahead of practical considerations. He remains a rock star on college campuses, here and abroad, and he\u2019s become a sort of North Star for the post-Occupy generation that today refuses to feel the Bern-out.\n\nHe remains, unfortunately, a figure alien in the places where policy gets made. But on his home ground at MIT, he is a notably accessible old professor who answers his e-mail and receives visitors like us with a twinkle.\n\nLast week, we visited Chomsky with an open-ended mission in mind: We were looking for a nonstandard account of our recent history from a man known for telling the truth. We\u2019d written him that we wanted to hear not what he thinks but how. He\u2019d written back that hard work and an open mind have a lot to do with it, also, in his words, a \u201cSocratic-style willingness to ask whether conventional doctrines are justified.\u201d\n\nChristopher Lydon: All we want you to do is to explain where in the world we are at a time\u2014\n\nCL: [Laughs]\u2014When so many people were on the edge of something, something historic. Is there a Chomsky summary?\n\nCL: Yeah. With His Assault on PBS and NPR, Trump Seeks to Eliminate Real News PHOTOS: Since Standing Rock, 56 Bills Have Been Introduced in 30 States to Restrict Protests NC: Well, a brief summary I think is if you take a look at recent history since the Second World War, something really remarkable has happened. First, human intelligence created two huge sledgehammers capable of terminating our existence\u2014or at least organized existence\u2014both from the Second World War. One of them is familiar. In fact, both are by now familiar. The Second World War ended with the use of nuclear weapons. It was immediately obvious on August 6, 1945, a day that I remember very well. It was obvious that soon technology would develop to the point where it would lead to terminal disaster. Scientists certainly understood this. In 1947 the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists inaugurated its famous Doomsday Clock. You know, how close the minute hand was to midnight? And it started seven minutes to midnight. By 1953 it had moved to two minutes to midnight. That was the year when the United States and Soviet Union exploded hydrogen bombs. But it turns out we now understand that at the end of the Second World War the world also entered into a new geological epoch. It\u2019s called the Anthropocene, the epoch in which humans have a severe, in fact maybe disastrous impact on the environment. It moved again in 2015, again in 2016. Immediately after the Trump election late January this year, the clock was moved again to two and a half minutes to midnight, the closest it\u2019s been since \u201953. So there\u2019s the two existential threats that we\u2019ve created\u2014which might in the case of nuclear war maybe wipe us out; in the case of environmental catastrophe, create a severe impact\u2014and then some. A third thing happened. Beginning around the \u201970s, human intelligence dedicated itself to eliminating, or at least weakening, the main barrier against these threats. It\u2019s called neoliberalism. There was a transition at that time from the period of what some people call \u201cregimented capitalism,\u201d the \u201950s and \u201960s, the great growth period, egalitarian growth, a lot of advances in social justice and so on\u2014 NC: Social democracy, yeah. That\u2019s sometimes called \u201cthe golden age of modern capitalism.\u201d That changed in the \u201970s with the onset of the neoliberal era that we\u2019ve been living in since. And if you ask yourself what this era is, its crucial principle is undermining mechanisms of social solidarity and mutual support and popular engagement in determining policy. It\u2019s not called that. What it\u2019s called is \u201cfreedom,\u201d but \u201cfreedom\u201d means a subordination to the decisions of concentrated, unaccountable, private power. That\u2019s what it means. The institutions of governance\u2014or other kinds of association that could allow people to participate in decision making\u2014those are systematically weakened. Margaret Thatcher said it rather nicely in her aphorism about \u201cthere is no society, only individuals.\u201d Since the Second World War, we have created two means of destruction. Since the neoliberal era, we have dismantled the way of handling them. She was actually, unconsciously no doubt, paraphrasing Marx, who in his condemnation of the repression in France said, \u201cThe repression is turning society into a sack of potatoes, just individuals, an amorphous mass can\u2019t act together.\u201d That was a condemnation. For Thatcher, it\u2019s an ideal\u2014and that\u2019s neoliberalism. We destroy or at least undermine the governing mechanisms by which people at least in principle can participate to the extent that society\u2019s democratic. So weaken them, undermine unions, other forms of association, leave a sack of potatoes and meanwhile transfer decisions to unaccountable private power all in the rhetoric of freedom. Well, what does that do? The one barrier to the threat of destruction is an engaged public, an informed, engaged public acting together to develop means to confront the threat and respond to it. That\u2019s been systematically weakened, consciously. I mean, back to the 1970s we\u2019ve probably talked about this. There was a lot of elite discussion across the spectrum about the danger of too much democracy and the need to have what was called more \u201cmoderation\u201d in democracy, for people to become more passive and apathetic and not to disturb things too much, and that\u2019s what the neoliberal programs do. So put it all together and what do you have? A perfect storm. CL: What everybody notices is all the headline things, including Brexit and Donald Trump and Hindu nationalism and nationalism everywhere and Le Pen all kicking in more or less together and suggesting some real world phenomenon. NC: it\u2019s very clear, and it was predictable. You didn\u2019t know exactly when, but when you impose socioeconomic policies that lead to stagnation or decline for the majority of the population, undermine democracy, remove decision-making out of popular hands, you\u2019re going to get anger, discontent, fear take all kinds of forms. And that\u2019s the phenomenon that\u2019s misleadingly called \u201cpopulism.\u201d CL: I don\u2019t know what you think of Pankaj Mishra, but I enjoy his book Age of Anger, and he begins with an anonymous letter to a newspaper from somebody who says, \u201cWe should admit that we are not only horrified but baffled. Nothing since the triumph of Vandals in Rome and North Africa has seemed so suddenly incomprehensible and difficult to reverse.\u201d NC: Well, that\u2019s the fault of the information system, because it\u2019s very comprehensible and very obvious and very simple. Take, say the United States, which actually suffered less from these policies than many other countries. Take the year 2007, a crucial year right before the crash. What was the wondrous economy that was then being praised? It was one in which the wages, the real wages of American workers, were actually lower than they were in 1979 when the neoliberal period began. That\u2019s historically unprecedented except for trauma or war or something like that. Here is a long period in which real wages had literally declined, while there was some wealth created but in very few pockets. It was also a period in which new institutions developed, financial institutions. You go back to the \u201950s and \u201960s, a so-called Golden Age, banks were connected to the real economy. That was their function. There were also no crashes because there were New Deal regulations. Starting in the early \u201970s there was a sharp change. First of all, financial institutions exploded in scale. By 2007 they actually had 40 percent of corporate profits. Furthermore, they weren\u2019t connected to the real economy anymore. In Europe the way democracy is undermined is very direct. Decisions are placed in the hands of an unelected troika: the European Commission, which is unelected; the IMF, of course unelected; and the European Central Bank. They make the decisions. So people are very angry, they\u2019re losing control of their lives. The economic policies are mostly harming them, and the result is anger, disillusion, and so on. We just saw it two weeks ago in the last French election. The two candidates were both outside the establishment. Centrist political parties have collapsed. We saw it in the American election last November. There were two candidates who mobilized the base: one of them a billionaire hated by the establishment, the Republican candidate who won the nomination\u2014but notice that once he\u2019s in power it\u2019s the old establishment that\u2019s running things. You can rail against Goldman Sachs on the campaign trail, but you make sure that they run the economy once you\u2019re in. CL: So, the question is, at a moment when people are almost ready\u2026 when they\u2019re ready to act and almost ready to recognize that this game is not working, this social system, do we have the endowment as a species to act on it, to move into that zone of puzzlement and then action? NC: I think the fate of the species depends on it because, remember, it\u2019s not just inequality, stagnation. It\u2019s terminal disaster. We have constructed a perfect storm. That should be the screaming headlines every day. Since the Second World War, we have created two means of destruction. Since the neoliberal era, we have dismantled the way of handling them. That\u2019s our pincers. That\u2019s what we face, and if that problem isn\u2019t solved, we\u2019re done with. CL: I want to go back Pankaj Mishra and the Age of Anger for a moment\u2014 NC: It\u2019s not the Age of Anger. It\u2019s the Age of Resentment against socioeconomic policies which have harmed the majority of the population for a generation and have consciously and in principle undermined democratic participation. Why shouldn\u2019t there be anger? CL: Pankaj Mishra calls it\u2014it\u2019s a Nietzschean word\u2014\u201cressentiment,\u201d meaning this kind of explosive rage. But he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the defining feature of a world where the modern promise of equality collides with massive disparities of power, education, status and\u2014 NC: Which was designed that way, which was designed that way. Go back to the 1970s. Across the spectrum, elite spectrum, there was deep concern about the activism of the \u201960s. It\u2019s called the \u201ctime of troubles.\u201d It civilized the country, which is dangerous. What happened is that large parts of the population\u2014which had been passive, apathetic, obedient\u2014tried to enter the political arena in one or another way to press their interests and concerns. They\u2019re called \u201cspecial interests.\u201d That means minorities, young people, old people, farmers, workers, women. In other words, the population. The population are special interests, and their task is to just watch quietly. And that was explicit. Two documents came out right in the mid-\u201970s, which are quite important. They came from opposite ends of the political spectrum, both influential, and both reached the same conclusions. One of them, at the left end, was by the Trilateral Commission\u2014liberal internationalists, three major industrial countries, basically the Carter administration, that\u2019s where they come from. That is the more interesting one [The Crisis of Democracy, a Trilateral Commission report]. The American rapporteur Samuel Huntington of Harvard, he looked back with nostalgia to the days when, as he put it, Truman was able to run the country with the cooperation of a few Wall Street lawyers and executives. Then everything was fine. Democracy was perfect. But in the \u201960s they all agreed it became problematic because the special interests started trying to get into the act, and that causes too much pressure and the state can\u2019t handle that. NC: We have to have more moderation in democracy. CL: Not only that, he turned Al Smith\u2019s line around. Al Smith said, \u201cThe cure for democracy is more democracy.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, the cure for this democracy is less democracy.\u201d NC: It wasn\u2019t him. It was the liberal establishment. He was speaking for them. This is a consensus view of the liberal internationalists and the three industrial democracies. They\u2014in their consensus\u2014they concluded that a major problem is what they called, their words, \u201cthe institutions responsible for the indoctrination of the young.\u201d The schools, the universities, churches, they\u2019re not doing their job. They\u2019re not indoctrinating the young properly. The young have to be returned to passivity and obedience, and then democracy will be fine. That\u2019s the left end. Now what do you have at the right end? A very influential document, the Powell Memorandum, came out at the same time. Lewis Powell, a corporate lawyer, later Supreme Court justice, he produced a confidential memorandum for the US Chamber of Commerce, which has been extremely influential. It more or less set off the modern so-called \u201cconservative movement.\u201d The rhetoric is kind of crazy. We don\u2019t go through it, but the basic picture is that this rampaging left has taken over everything. We have to use the resources that we have to beat back this rampaging New Left which is undermining freedom and democracy. Connected with this was something else. As a result of the activism of the \u201960s and the militancy of labor, there was a falling rate of profit. That\u2019s not acceptable. So we have to reverse the falling rate of profit, we have to undermine democratic participation, what comes? Neoliberalism, which has exactly those effects.

You can also check our Bitcoin address, which is public.\u201d\n\nThe page lists a \u20ac10,000 donation by \"Hack Back!\".

Their stated goal is to recycle human and animal waste as ecological fertiliser for the region\u2019s wheat farms.\n\n\"They're in an incredibly difficult situation, with ISIS on one side and US ally Turkey embargoing and attacking them on the other,\" the hacker told Ars. \"Yet, in a part of the world the West likes to look down on as a backwards shithole, they're building a society that takes \u2018Western\u2019 values like democracy and feminism to lengths that put the West to shame. All while fighting ISIS and winning, unlike the US trained and supplied Iraqi army.\"\n\nThe hacker donated the money not only to support Rojava, but also to draw media coverage to the region, which he said too often defaulted to a \"gimmicky article about women fighting ISIS, headlined by a picture of a hot chick with a gun.\"\n\nInstead, he argued that Rojava should be compared to \"other libertarian revolutions or attempts such as anarchism during the Spanish Civil War [1], the Ukrainian Free Territory [2], the Paris Commune [3], autonomous Shinmin [4], a small glimmer of hope from inside the empire [5] [the Seattle General Strike of 1919], APPO [6], CIPO-RFM [7], or the Zapatistas [8].\"\n\nRojava stretches along the Syrian-Turkish border for 400km or so, and is bounded to the south and west by the Euphrates River and to the east by Iraq. The region also includes the northwestern tip of Syria. The two parts are separated by around 100km of ISIL-controlled territory.\n\nThe US is not a fan. In March of this year, US State Department spokesman John Kirby told Reuters that \"We don't support self-ruled, semi-autonomous zones inside Syria. We just don't.\"\n\nTo others, though, Rojava is on the cutting edge of progress. \"What you are doing is a unique experiment that deserves to succeed,\" Raymond Joliffe (Lord Hylton), a member of the UK House of Lords, said during a 2015 visit, according to The New York Times.\n\nDavid Graeber, a professor at the London School of Economics, who visited Rojava in December 2014, agreed with the hacker's analysis that the region bears strong resemblance to past anarchist movements. The difference, he told Ars, was that in this case \"they're a radical anti-authoritarian movement that's also militarily super-effective.\"\n\nHowever, Graeber dismissed the idea that the funds would be used for something other than purchasing farm equipment. \"They have dire economic needs,\" he said, but \"militarily they are already getting what they need from the US and Russia, even though neither will admit it.\"\n\nGraeber also noted that Rojava \"captures most of their weapons from ISIS because they're much better fighters.\"\n\nTar\u00ee emphasised that Rojava Plan is not part of the region\u2019s military.\n\n\u201cWe are part of the economic committee and do civil projects not military ones,\u201d Tar\u00ee told Ars. \u201cIf we get the one million euros [which Phineas Phisher has suggested he will donate] we would use it to fund our other projects that we want to do such as the Kurdish Ubuntu distro and earthbags for construction.\u201d"}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/polish-women-strike-abortion-laws-restrictions-changes-economy-a7339141.html": {"title": "Polish women to stage all-out strike next week", "keywords": ["Poland", " abortion", " Law", " crime", " Police", " Health", " Europe", " World", " News"], "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/polish-women-strike-abortion-laws-restrictions-changes-economy-a7339141.html", "text": "Women in Poland are to stage an all-out strike to protest the country\u2019s plan to effectively ban abortions.\n\nFemale workers across the predominantly Catholic country will take part in the action on Monday, in an effort to disruptively draw attention to attempts to restrict Poland\u2019s severely limited abortion laws even further.\n\nThose taking part hope the strike will bring Polish society and the economy to a standstill.\n\nCurrently, abortion is only permitted in cases of rape or if the woman or foetus\u2019 life is in danger.

If you have to be at work or at home: Dress in black, take a picture and post [on] social media with the hashtag #BlackProtest #CzarnyProtest to show solidarity. Talk to your mother, sister, cousin, friend, colleague. Tell them about the strike and the situation in Poland.\u201d\n\nThe strike has received support from high profile Polish figures including super model Anja Rubik, who shared her support on social media.\n\nThe pressure group Stop Abortion has driven calls for a total ban on abortions in Poland. It is supported by the Catholic Church and Prime Minister Beata Szydlo as well as Deputy Justice Minister Patryk Jaki have indicated support for the group. A total of 87 per cent of Polish people identify as Catholic and the church continues to hold considerable influence over society.\n\nAccording to official figures, around 1,000 legal abortions are performed in Poland every year. However, it is estimated that a considerably higher number also take place illegally, with up to 150,000 women each year performing abortions on themselves often with pills bought online.\n\nIn June of last year, activists used drones to fly abortion pills into Poland in a show of solidarity with local women.\n\nGlobally, 66 countries permit abortion only if a woman\u2019s life is in danger. A further 59 permit it solely to prevent serious harm to a woman\u2019s health.\n\nIn the UK, it is a criminal offence to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, where women face up to life in prison for having an abortion, including in instances of rape, incest or if the foetus is so severely disabled that it will not survive birth.\n\nIn April of this year, a 21-year-old woman was trialled in a Belfast court and found guilty of \u201ccommitting\u201d an abortion aged 19, when she performed an abortion at home and her flatmates reported her to the police after finding foetal remains in their household bin and she was subsequently arrested. Westminster MPs have been urged to overturn the ban by passing legislation in the House of Commons."}, "http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/give-em-hell-bernie-20150429?page=2": {"title": "Give 'Em Hell, Bernie", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/give-em-hell-bernie-20150429?page=2", "text": "Many years ago I pitched a magazine editor on a story about Bernie Sanders, then a congressman from Vermont, who'd agreed to something extraordinary \u2013 he agreed to let me, a reporter, stick next to him without restrictions over the course of a month in congress.\n\nCampaign 2016: Hillary Clinton's Fake Populism Is a Hit Pundits say her idealist porridge is not too hot, not too cold, but just fake enough\n\n\"People need to know how this place works. It's absurd,\" he'd said. (Bernie often uses the word absurd, his Brooklyn roots coming through in his pronunciation \u2013 ob-zert.)\n\nBernie wasn't quite so famous at the time and the editor scratched his head. \"Bernie Sanders,\" he said. \"That's the one who cares, right?\"\n\n\"Right, that's the guy,\" I said.\n\nI got the go-ahead and the resulting story was a wild journey through the tortuous bureaucratic maze of our national legislature. I didn't write this at the time, but I was struck every day by what a strange and interesting figure Sanders was.\n\nMany of the battles he brought me along to witness, he lost. And no normal politician would be comfortable with the optics of bringing a Rolling Stone reporter to a Rules Committee hearing.\n\nBut Sanders genuinely, sincerely, does not care about optics. He is the rarest of Washington animals, a completely honest person. If he's motivated by anything other than a desire to use his influence to protect people who can't protect themselves, I've never seen it. Bernie Sanders is the kind of person who goes to bed at night thinking about how to increase the heating-oil aid program for the poor.\n\nThis is why his entrance into the 2016 presidential race is a great thing and not a mere footnote to the inevitable coronation of Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee. If the press is smart enough to grasp it, his entrance into the race makes for a profound storyline that could force all of us to ask some very uncomfortable questions.\n\nHere's the thing: Sanders is a politician whose power base is derived almost entirely from the people of the state of Vermont, where he is personally known to a surprisingly enormous percentage of voters.\n\nHis chief opponents in the race to the White House, meanwhile, derive their power primarily from corporate and financial interests. That doesn't make them bad people or even bad candidates necessarily, but it's a fact that the Beltway-media cognoscenti who decide these things make access to money the primary factor in determining whether or not a presidential aspirant is \"viable\" or \"credible.\" Here's how the Wall Street Journal put it in their story about Sanders (emphasis mine):\n\nIt is unclear how much money Mr. Sanders expects to raise, or what he thinks he needs to run a credible race. Mr. Sanders raised about $7 million for his last re-election in Vermont, a small state. Sums needed to run nationally are far larger.\n\nThe Washington/national press has trained all of us to worry about these questions of financing on behalf of candidates even at such an early stage of a race as this.\n\nIn this manner we're conditioned to believe that the candidate who has the early assent of a handful of executives on Wall Street and in Hollywood and Silicon Valley is the \"serious\" politician, while the one who is merely the favorite of large numbers of human beings is an irritating novelty act whose only possible goal could be to cut into the numbers of the real players.\n\nSanders offers an implicit challenge to the current system of national electoral politics. With rare exceptions, campaign season is a time when the backroom favorites of financial interests are marketed to the population. Weighed down by highly regressive policy intentions, these candidates need huge laboratories of focus groups and image consultants to guide them as they grope around for a few lines they can use to sell themselves to regular working people.\n\nSanders on the other hand has no constituency among the monied crowd. \"Billionaires do not flock to my campaign,\" he quipped. So what his race is about is the reverse of the usual process: he'll be marketing the interests of regular people to the gatekeeping Washington press, in the hope that they will give his ideas a fair shot.\n\nIt's a little-known fact, but we reporters could successfully sell Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or any other populist candidate as a serious contender for the White House if we wanted to. Hell, we told Americans it was okay to vote for George Bush, a man who moves his lips when he reads.\n\nBut the lapdog mentality is deeply ingrained and most Beltway scribes prefer to wait for a signal from above before they agree to take anyone not sitting atop a mountain of cash seriously.\n\nThus this whole question of \"seriousness\" \u2013 which will dominate coverage of the Sanders campaign \u2013 should really be read as a profound indictment of our political system, which is now so openly an oligarchy that any politician who doesn't have the blessing of the bosses is marginalized before he or she steps into the ring.\n\nI remember the first time I was sold on Bernie Sanders as a politician. He was in his congressional office and he was ranting about the fact that many of the manufacturing and financial companies who asked him and other members of congress for tax breaks and aid were also in the business of moving American jobs overseas to places like China.\n\nSanders spent years trying to drum up support for a simple measure that would force any company that came to Washington asking for handouts to promise they wouldn't turn around and ship jobs to China or India.\n\nThat didn't seem like a lot to ask, but his fellow members treated him like he was asking for a repeal of the free enterprise system. This issue drove Sanders crazy. Again showing his Brooklyn roots, Bernie gets genuinely mad about these things. While some pols are kept up at night worrying about the future profitability of gazillionaire banks, Sanders seethes over the many obvious wrongs that get smoothed over and covered up at his place of work.\n\nThat saltiness, I'm almost sure of it, is what drove him into this race. He just can't sit by and watch the things that go on, go on. That's not who he is.\n\nWhen I first met Bernie Sanders, I'd just spent over a decade living in formerly communist Russia. The word \"socialist\" therefore had highly negative connotations for me, to the point where I didn't even like to say it out loud.\n\nBut Bernie Sanders is not Bukharin or Trotsky. His concept of \"Democratic Socialism\" as I've come to understand it over the years is that an elected government should occasionally step in and offer an objection or two toward our progress to undisguised oligarchy. Or, as in the case of not giving tax breaks to companies who move factories overseas, our government should at least not finance the disappearance of the middle class.\n\nMaybe that does qualify as radical and unserious politics in our day and age. If that's the case, we should at least admit how much trouble we're in."}, "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/jeremy-corbyn-unveils-right-own-john-lewis-style-employee-ownership-policy-1581548": {"title": "Jeremy Corbyn unveils 'Right to Own' John Lewis-style employee ownership policy", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/jeremy-corbyn-unveils-right-own-john-lewis-style-employee-ownership-policy-1581548", "text": "A Labour government would give workers the first refusal to buy their company if it came up for sale, Jeremy Corbyn announced today (15 September).\n\nThe radical 'Right to Own' policy is similar to Ed Miliband's 2015 general election commitment to \"explore\" giving staff the statutory right to request employee ownership during business succession.\n\n\"The productivity benefits are clear, with worker-owned companies typically being more productive than those that are more traditionally owned,\" Corbyn stated about the initiative.\n\n\"Labour will look to create a 'Right to Own', giving workers facing a change of ownership or closure of a firm the first refusal in putting together a worker-owned alternative.\"\n\nThe left-winger said regional development banks will be tasked with providing the finance to make employee ownership and co-operative ownership a \"reality across our economy\".\n\n\"I want to see local councils building on the example of Preston, where a focus on using local government procurement ... has helped support the local economy with real investment and sustain co-operative local enterprises,\" Corbyn added.\n\n\"But we can go further than this ...

Organized by a coalition of prisoner rights, labor, and racial justice groups, the strikes will include prisoners from at least 20 states\u2014making this the largest effort to organize incarcerated people in US history.\n\nThis article was originally published by The Influence, a news site that covers the full spectrum of human relationships with drugs. Follow The Influence on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nThe actions will represent a powerful, long-awaited blow against the status quo in what has become the most incarcerated nation on earth. A challenge to mass incarceration and the prison-industrial complex in general, the strikes will focus specifically on the widespread exploitation of incarcerated workers\u2014what the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) describes as \u201ca call to action against slavery in America.\u201d\n\nThe chosen date will mark 45 years since the Attica prison uprising (pictured above), the bloodiest and most notorious US prison conflict. The 1971 rebellion\u2014which involved 1,300 prisoners and lasted five days\u2014and the state\u2019s brutal response claimed the lives of dozens of prisoners and guards. The events left a lasting scar, but have inspired a new generation among today\u2019s much larger incarcerated population.\n\nTomorrow (August 10), information campaigns, speaking events, and solidarity demonstrations will take place in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota, California and elsewhere.\n\nThe organizing coalition includes The Ordinary People Society (TOPS), Free Alabama Movement (FAM), Free Virginia Movement, Free Ohio Movement, Free Mississippi Movement, New Underground Railroad Movement (CA), Formerly Incarcerated, Convicted People, and Families Movement (FICPFM), and IWOC\u2014which has chapters across the country and with which I\u2019ve been involved for several years.\n\nFICPFM has scheduled a national conference September 9-10 to coincide with the main strikes, which have also been endorsed by the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nThese widespread and coordinated actions haven\u2019t happened overnight; they\u2019re the result of years of struggle by people on both sides of the prison walls. Significantly, it\u2019s incarcerated people who are taking the reins in organizing the strikes this time around\u2014despite intimidation by the state.\n\nIf history is an indicator, the state will do all it can to limit media coverage. So organizers inside and outside are organizing communication via YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. The \u201crevolution\u201d may not be televised, but these strikes will be accessible in real-time via social media, despite prison officials\u2019 efforts to keep them hidden.\n\nOrganizing incarcerated people on such a large scale is unprecedented for a reason. As recently as 2009, during my two-year stay with the Georgia Department of Corrections, simply talking about unions was unthinkable for fear of retaliation and isolation.\n\nNow, not only are incarcerated workers in Georgia and across the country talking about fighting back against an unjust system\u2014they\u2019re actually doing it.\n\nMany of us involved with organizing this wave of strikes weren\u2019t even born when Attica happened. But we do have the twin resources of plenty of history to learn from and modern communications\u2014especially mobile phones and social media\u2014to lean on as we seek to shape resistance.\n\nAttica happened at a time when, like today, racial tensions and conflict between police and people of color and poor people were high. In 1971, the Civil Rights Movement and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X were fresh in the public mind, and the government was systematically targeting and eliminating leaders of more militant groups like the Black Panthers.\n\nThree months before the Attica Uprising, President Richard Nixon had declared his War on Drugs. The combined US state and federal prison population then hovered below 200,000 people.\n\nThrough the Reagan and Clinton years\u2014which ramped up the drug war and introduced mandatory minimum sentencing\u2014until today, that number ballooned to over 1.5 million. In total, over 2.2 million people now behind bars\u2014in jail, prison,immigration detention, or youth detention\u2014on any given day.\n\nThis makes the United States the world\u2019s number one prison state and massively raises the stakes for organized resistance. Millions of people\u2019s lives and freedom are on the line.\n\nEarlier Uprisings and the Long March to Reform\n\nThe few improvements we\u2019ve seen to the US incarceration system have been painfully slow in coming\u2014and they frequently occur only after resistance from inside or public pressure from outside, like the 2009 Rockefeller drug law reforms\n\nThe Attica uprising led to sweeping changes in New York\u2019s penal system, but many of the particpants\u2019 grievances remain problems today. The demands of recent prison strikers strongly echo Attica\u2019s Manifesto of Demands and the earlierdemands of inmates at Folsom in California: basic medical care; fair pay for work; an end to abuse and brutality by prison staff; fair decisions by parole boards; sanitary living conditions; and adequate and nutritious meals.\n\nOne of the clearest, and least known, examples of prison workers striking to improve conditions came from North Carolina Correctional Institute for Women (NCCIW) in 1975, four years after Attica. Incarcerated women there staged a sit-in strike against conditions at the state\u2019s only prison laundry facility.\n\nTheir nonviolent protest was met with force by prison guards, who corralled them into a gymnasium and assaulted them. The women fought back, triggering the state to send in 100 guards from other prisons to quell the uprising. The prison resumed normal operations four days after the strike began, but the prison laundry was closed shortly after the incident. [1. & 2.]\n\nThe NCCIW strike, the Attica Uprising, and the Lucasville, Ohio prison rebellion of 1993\u2014the only major prison uprising in the US to be resolved peacefully\u2014 provide vital lessons for prisoners and their allies on the outside.\n\nSiddique Abdullah Hassan, who participated in the Lucasville uprising and remains incarcerated, was recently interviewed by IWOC members. He expressed the need for solid support from the outside during prisoner resistance:\n\nThe wave of hunger strikes and work stoppages that have built up to the September 9 coalition began in December 2010, when inmates at six Georgia prisons refused to report for meals and work assignments.\n\nSince almost all the work that allows Georgia\u2019s prison system to function comes from unpaid inmate labor\u2014cooking meals, maintaining facilities, picking up trash, repairing storm damage, and doing other work for county government that would otherwise be filled by members of the community (many incarcerated workers work alongside workers from the free world), even building new prisons and handling administrative tasks for prison officials\u2014the strike made an immediate and lasting impact.\n\nThe strikers\u2019 demands were simple and familiar. So was the State\u2019s response. The Georgia Department of Corrections reacted by shutting off water and electricity to the strikers\u2019 living quarters. Most of them quickly succumbed to these harsh measures, but a handful dug in and continue to resist.\n\nThe state retaliated against 37 inmates who were identified as organizers with extreme isolation and punishment.\n\nPrison guards at Smith State Prison in South Georgia were captured on film brutally beating Kelvin Stevenson and Miguel Jackson with hammers [caution: graphic violence]. In what prisoners say is a long-running practice, the two men were isolated from public view and denied visits from family members and legal counsel until their wounds healed.\n\nThree Georgia corrections officers were convicted in 2014 for an earlier beating, but justice continues to elude Jackson, Stevenson and their families. The Georgia Department of Corrections responded to the beatings by asking Google to censor the YouTube video.\n\nFour of the original Georgia strikers, now under close security, staged another hunger strike in 2015. This time their only demand was that their security level be reconsidered, per state policy.\n\nThe Southeast, which incarcerates more of its residents than any other US region, has been a focal point of prison organizing.\n\nInspired by the actions of their Georgia neighbors, incarcerated workers and supporters in Alabama began organizing work stoppages and hunger strikes of their own under the banner Free Alabama Movement (FAM). Since its inception, FAM has organized for a flurry of work stoppages and minor uprisings at St. Clair, Holman and Staton Correctional Facilities in 2014, 2015 and earlier this year.\n\nFAM organizers explain in this YouTube video why they\u2019re organizing incarcerated workers:\n\nFAM developed a manifesto called \u201cLet the Crops Rot in the Fields,\u201d which lays out a framework that\u2019s spread to prisons across the country. Instead of relying on support from the outside or passive actions like hunger strikes, incarcerated workers are utilizing the most powerful tool they have: their labor.\n\nIncarcerated workers are paid pennies an hour\u2014or not at all in Georgia and Texas\u2014for often-backbreaking labor that keeps prisons operating and benefits the state and, increasingly, private corporations.\n\nIf they refuse or are unable to work, inmates say they\u2019re subject to punishment, including \u201cisolation, restraint positions, stripping off our clothes and investigating our bodies as though we are animals.\u201d\n\nFAM is also working within the system to enact legislation geared toward improving conditions for incarcerated people in Alabama. They recently presented the Alabama Freedom Bill, which would expand access to education, rehabilitation, and reentry services\u2014services which are already supposed to exist on paper, but rarely do in practice.\n\nPastor Kenneth Glasgow, a formerly incarcerated person whose organization, The Ordinary People\u2019s Society (TOPS), was a critical player in the early resistance in Georgia and Alabama, says: \u201cThey created the School-to-Prison Pipeline, we want to flip that and organize a Re-entry Pipeline.\u201d\n\nConsidering the barriers to employment, education and housing created by a criminal record, reentry services are vital, yet the state rarely gives them priority\u2014if they provide them at all.\n\nAn Alternative to the Silence of Mainstream Unions\n\nAt a time of high tension, this coalition finds itself at a critical intersection of racial, structural and economic oppression.\n\nMainstream unions have been largely silent on the issue of inmate labor. In fact, major unions like American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and the Teamsters represent corrections officers and police across the country\u2014placing them in direct conflict with prison workers and the most marginalized people in our society.\n\nThese unions frequently fight to keep prisons open, even when their members are guaranteed work elsewhere. This effectively puts them in the same boat as private prison companies like Corrections Corporation of America and GEO Group, whose contracts often contain quotas which require a certain percentage of beds remain filled.\n\nIWOC currently counts about 1,000 incarcerated members, a number which continues to grow as September 9 approaches. This makes it the largest area of organizing within Industrial Workers of the World\u2014a labor union controlled directly by workers which operates outside the mainstream union model.\n\nMost, though not all incarcerated people have committed crimes\u2014or at least, what are considered \u201ccrimes\u201d under our current system. But they often do so out of necessity, sometimes to support drug problems where treatment or harm reduction services don\u2019t exist and, too often, to support families or just survive in a system which discriminates by race, gender, sexuality and economic status, and robs anyone with a criminal record of opportunities.\n\nIncarcerated workers are still workers, regardless of criminal records. Other than by ending or massively reducing incarceration itself, it is only by building connections between workers behind bars and in the free world that will we begin to reform a system that feeds on human suffering.\n\nSeptember 9 could be the most powerful call in over a generation to reform\u2014or dismantle\u2014a system that IWOC organizer and Ohio prisoner Sean Swain calls a \u201cthird world colony\u201d within the US and a \u201ccanary in the coal mine.\u201d Conditions in prison today foreshadow what workers on the outside might face in the future, because the oppression inside is merely an amplified version of the oppression faced by poor people everywhere.

But first, two caveats about these data are worth bearing in mind. The national YouGov survey was done near the middle of January, before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. Public Policy Polling is a company aligned with the Democratic Party, and some of its results over the years have been suspected of bias. Taken by itself, its conclusions could be doubted.

Santa Claus\u2019s workshops had been reeling from the global economic recession. The sense of discontent among our ranks was palpable. Since then we have been meeting biweekly to develop a concrete analysis of our conditions as workers, as well as debate strategies for resistance.\n\nThe following is a document we are submitting to the group in the spirit of deepening our analysis.\n\nThe Arab Spring and the Occupy movement radicalized many elves. But it is clear that there remains uncertainty about what it will take to challenge the system of exploitation we live under. We believe that the confusion around political strategy is at least in part a product of a mistaken analysis of the class structure and dynamics of our economic system.\n\nWhat is the true nature of the relationships among elves, Santa Claus and his reindeer? How were these relations first constituted and how are they reproduced?\n\nIn order to answer these questions, we first need to grapple with the dynamics of our supposed \u201cgift economy.\u201d While it is true that the gifts we produce are not sold, they are governed by more than social norms and custom. Warm cookies can sustain Santa\u2019s waistline, but a manufacturer cannot survive on sugar and flour alone (unless, of course, he\u2019s selling cookies). He still needs money to expand his workshop and to purchase new equipment or maintain ones of an older vintage.\n\nAnother issue is that our workshops depend on resources not immediately available to us in the North Pole. For a long time Santa could simply exploit our natural reserves of wood and fossil-based fuels. But as new product lines have been introduced additional materials need to be purchased on a global market.\n\nIn place of wooden toys we have increasingly had to adopt plastics in order to effectively compete in the Christmas market. This has as much to do with consumer demand as it does unit labor costs. While Santa might want to think he lives in a gift bubble, a growing share of annual Christmas presents has been privatized since the onset of the neoliberal era, made possible by increased price competition with thriving Chinese industry.\n\nBut competition has not led Santa to necessarily increase the productivity of each worker. Instead he has been able to drive down unit costs of production by more aggressively sweating the labor he already employs, or by simply adding more workers to reduce the time the workshop is left idle. As long he has surplus elf labor to draw on, as he certainly still does, we cannot expect him to be much concerned with the health and safety grievances we have filed with management.\n\nFurthermore, gratitude only gets a businessman so far. Santa, as sole proprietor, is able to keep his finances secret. But those who have had the misfortune to work in his office have reported that letters from the Vatican and Washington have regularly arrived days before Santa announces quarterly plans for production. We can surmise that financial support from these sources, along with their yearly estimates of \u201cnice\u201d children, are what actually sustains our economy. It is through these external funds that Santa is able to provide the candy and shelter for which we must exchange our labor power.\n\nBut how did he come to hold such power over us? Was it through greater ingenuity or was it something more sinister?"}, "https://www.rt.com/usa/343096-cia-nelson-mandela-arrest/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS": {"title": "CIA tip led to arrest of 'dangerous communist' Nelson Mandela, says former US spy", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/343096-cia-nelson-mandela-arrest/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS", "text": "A former CIA agent has finally confirmed what the world has long suspected: the US agency was behind the arrest that put Nelson Mandela in prison for 27 years.\n\nTwo weeks before \u201cunrepentant\u201d 88-year-old Donald Rickard died, the CIA spy confessed to filmmaker John Irvin that his tip led to Mandela\u2019s arrest, according to a report in the Sunday Times.\n\nRickard defended the arrest of South Africa\u2019s most wanted man in 1962, which he says was necessary to capture \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous communist outside of the Soviet Union.\u201d\n\nRickard, who was officially working as US vice consul in the South African city of Durban at the time, said he learned Mandela was on his way to Natal, travelling between Johannesburg and Durban.\n\n\"I found out when he was coming down and how he was coming... that's where I was involved and that's where Mandela was caught,\u201d said Rickard, according to France24.\n\nThe former spy didn\u2019t explain how he received the information, but said he believed Mandela was \u201ccompletely under the control of the Soviet Union, a toy of the communists\u201d and about \u201cto incite\u201d the people of Natal into a mass rebellion against the apartheid regime.\n\nREAD MORE: \u200bCIA sued for records on possible role in Nelson Mandela arrest\n\n\u201cNatal was a cauldron at the time,\u201d said Rickard, \u201cand Mandela would have welcomed a war.

Or \u201cC\u201d for the gun Control he promoted.\n\nBefore any victims were even in the ground, he exploited the tragedy for politicized gun control agendas.\n\nObama is tired of making speeches about mass killings. He\u2019s tired of them. He doesn\u2019t want killings to be the \u201cnew normal.\u201d I agree with the President. Random, mass murder whether by guns, caused by mental illness, or by hatred needs to stop.\n\nTherefore, I took the liberty of finding its biggest source\u2026\n\nIf it\u2019s really true that you\u2019re 9 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than a terrorist \u2013 then we need to have a talk. But where is our speech to address the thousands of Americans executed by police in the last 15 years? Is it not as speech worthy when the number of dead Americans is only 3 per day and is spattered across the country? Victims one by one?\n\nAlthough we aren\u2019t allowed to know the actual number of American citizens killed by police each year, a database has been tracking news stories since 2013.\n\nIn 2014, at least 1,104 Americans were executed on site by law enforcement. No trial \u2013 just violent death. A quick scan of the headlines shows an inordinate amount of shooting deaths. So, the media reports on them, but without the outrage reserved for lone shooters who walk into public places spraying bullets at random people.\n\nNot only do some sources average the deaths out to 3 per day, but also one American every 7.6 hours. That means if you saw this headline before work, and then read the story after you got home from work \u2013 two Americans have likely died at the hands of law enforcement in the meantime.\n\nThe media supports the agenda to remove gun ownership from law abiding citizens because of conveniently timed and fishy looking mass shootings by deranged males \u2013 but not from deranged, gun-wielding males with badges. The ones who may gravitate to such positions, who don\u2019t get screened. Who can simply move to another state or nearby department and restart their law enforcement career after they have killed.\n\nBack to the numbers comparison \u2013 how does the amount of Americans murdered by police in 2014 (and on average every day) compare to the amount of Americans killed in all U.S. mass shootings? (A mass shooting is typically one person, who has randomly killed at least 4 people in a public place within 24 hours. Not to be confused with sprees, serial murders or mass genocide)\n\nIn 2014 police killed about twice the amount of Americans as those killed in all U.S. mass shootings combined, starting in 1982.\n\nThe amount of people killed in all U.S. mass shootings \u2013\n\nThat\u2019s 567 people in 157 shootings starting in the 1980s. In 2014 alone \u2013 in one year flat \u2013 police nearly killed double that amount.\n\nAgain, where are the speeches? Where are the calls for mental health screenings and strict regulations for the authorities? Officers who kill don\u2019t have their three-part name plastered on front pages \u2013 no calls for their guns removed. And when they happen to use one of their \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d weapons \u2013 they kill. When they have only their fists, boots or their arms \u2013 they kill.\n\nThis is precisely why you never, ever give up your Second Amendment \u2013 or your guns. The tragedy argument must always be flipped back to the authorities who want you to be without any defense, against deranged authorities with all the force. Turn. The. Tables.\n\nThe trouble with malleable media statistics and their tunnel vision is \u2013 it\u2019s all pretty, framed lies. Recall when school shootings first took place \u2013 it was reported on daily for what seemed like years until the word \u201cschool\u201d was now associated with \u201cshooting\u201d or gun violence. Of course it has has taken place and is horribly tragic. Nothing discounts that. But it\u2019s a focus redirect for a reaction and controlled outcome. Just think about what now continues to mow down Americans in violence at a most startling rate. Think about how different it would be if the media framed police involved shootings in the same light\u2026they should! It should always be a national tragedy.\n\nAn inordinate amount of shootings took place between 2010-2013. Obama doesn\u2019t even wait for burials anymore before he calls for the removal of guns before hitting the greens again. And if people don\u2019t pay attention and sift through the truth they will find themselves stuttering and speechless when authoritarians \u2013 law enforcement perhaps \u2013 yank guns from their warm, living hands.\n\nTake for instance, the new federal crime unit Chicago called for in the \u201cwake of the 2014 Chicago Easter weekend shootings.\u201d Guns were the boogeymen man in Obama\u2019s old stomping grounds despite the fact that Chicago boasted the strictest gun control laws in the country \u2013 and also surpassed New York City in murder crimes in 2011.\n\nThe media rode the choppy waves of pointing to crime in Chicago as a reason to rid its citizens of guns, but also wanting to showcase a drop in crime to show that strict gun control works. The problem is \u2013 there was no drop in murder. Just a drastic change in how homicides were reported. It\u2019s amazing how much a homicide looks like \u201cdeath from natural causes\u201d when law enforcement deliberately record it that way. Additionally, operations for this federal unit began April 1 \u2013 before Easter. How then could the unit be formed in \u201cthe wake of a shooting\u201d when it happened before the shooting took place? I think you know the answer to that\u2026\n\nAdditionally, the mainstream media is still purse-lipped on the \u201cmass shooting that never was.\u201d The one that was prevented by one responsible person with a gun. In fact, the \u201cnon-event\u201d was lumped in with other shooting stories to showcase \u201cmore gun violence.\u201d (That\u2019s also known as deception.) An off-duty female officer saves the world from another Aurora-type shooting? Normally, that holds all the media-trappings of a heroic cause for celebration. Except when that last slot on the machine doesn\u2019t match the greater agenda of gun control \u2013 then it doesn\u2019t make it past the cutting room floor.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m going to have to side with Obama on this one. Too many killings are taking place \u2013 it cannot be the \u201cnew normal\u201d \u2013 but where, O where, shall we look?\n\nThe Second Amendment is non-negotiable. It has to be, unless the world wants to witness an En Masse shooting here in America like never before. Which is why it was written of course \u2013 the only reason why it was written."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/your-new-iphone-features-oppression-inequality-vast-profit": {"title": "Your new iPhone\u2019s features include oppression, inequality \u2013 and vast profit | Aditya Chakrabortty", "keywords": ["Apple", "China", "iPhone 7", "US news"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/your-new-iphone-features-oppression-inequality-vast-profit", "text": "Soon enough, we will see the first obituaries for openness, free trade and globalisation. When those writers ponder how wealthy countries turned towards the politics of Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, they should devote a large chapter to Apple. Because the world\u2019s richest company is a textbook example of how the promises made after the fall of the Berlin Wall have been made a mockery of.\n\nWhatever marvels have been shoved into the new iPhones, the devices serve to increase the gulf between the super-rich and the rest of us, bilk countries of rightful tax revenues, and oppress Chinese workers even while depriving Americans of high-paying jobs. Arrogant towards critics and governments, glutted with cash and yet plainly out of ideas, Apple is elegant shorthand for a redundant economic system.\n\nNone of this is how we\u2019re meant to think of Apple, the multinational that is both on your side yet restlessly questing ahead. While launching the iPhone 7 this month, its marketing chief, Phil Schiller, explained why this model came without a earphone socket: \u201cIt really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on, do something new, that betters all of us.\u201d Such patchouli-scented Californian dipshittery was lapped up by the 7,000-strong crowd and lightly mocked by the press \u2013 but it also helps to obscure some of the less tolerable aspect of the iPhone business model, such as the conditions in which it is made.\n\nIf you own an iPhone it was assembled by workers at one of three firms in China: Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron. The biggest and most famous, Foxconn, came to international prominence in 2010 when an estimated 18 of its employees tried to kill themselves. At least 14 workers died. The company\u2019s response was to put up suicide nets, to catch people trying to jump to their death. That year, staff at Foxconn\u2019s Longhua factory made 137,000 iPhones a day, or around 90 a minute.\n\nOne of those attempted suicides, a 17-year-old called Tian Yu, flung herself from the fourth floor of a factory dormitory and ended up paralysed from the waist down. Speaking later to academic researchers, she described her working conditions in remarkable testimony that I then covered for the Guardian. She was essentially a human battery hen, working over 12 hours a day, six days a week, swapped between day and night shifts and kept in an eight-person dorm room.\n\nAfter the scandals of 2010, Apple vowed to improve conditions for its Chinese workers. It has since published a number of glossy brochures extolling its commitments to them. Yet there is no evidence that the Californian firm has given back a single penny of its gigantic profit margins to its contractors to ensure better treatment of the people who actually make its products.\n\nOver the past year, the US-based NGO China Labor Watch has published a series of investigations into Pegatron, another iPhone assembler. It sent a researcher on to the assembly line, interviewed dozens of Pegatron staff and analysed hundreds of pay stubs. Among its findings are that staff still work 12 hours a day, six days a week \u2013 one and a half hours of that unpaid. They are forced to do overtime, claims the NGO, and provided with illegally low levels of safety training.\n\nThe researcher was working on one iPhone motherboard every 3.75 seconds, standing up for the entirety of his 10.5-hour shift. Such is the punishment endured at Apple\u2019s contractors to make a living wage, apparently.\n\nThe Shanghai local government has raised the minimum wage over the past year; Pegatron has responded by cutting subsidies on things such as medical insurance so that the effective hourly pay for its staff has fallen.\n\nWhen questioned about these reports, Pegatron provided a statement that read in part: \u201cWe work hard to make sure every Pegatron facility provides a healthy work environment and allegations suggesting otherwise are simply not true \u2026 We have taken effective measures \u2026 to ensure employees do not work more than 60 hours per week and six days per week.\u201d\n\nAt another of Apple\u2019s major contractors, Wistron, a Danish human-rights NGO last year found extensive evidence of forced student labour. Teenagers doing degrees in accountancy or business management were sent for months to an assembly line at Wistron. This is a serious violation of International Labour Organisation convention, yet investigators for Danwatch found evidence that thousands of students were doing the same work and backbreaking hours there as the adults \u2013 but costing less.\n\nThe teenagers told Danwatch that they were working against their will. \u201cWe are all depressed,\u201d one 19-year-old girl said. \u201cBut we have no choice, because the school told us that if we refused, we would not get our diploma.\u201d Despite several requests for comment, Wistron did not respond.\n\nThat investigation was not at a factory making iPhones, but Apple confirmed that Wistron and Pegatron were two of their major assemblers in China. While it did not wish to say anything on the record, Apple\u2019s press officers pointed me to the audits it had commissioned into its supplier factories. Yet the inspections are almost conveniently skimpy.\n\nLook at the report Apple commissioned into Foxconn in 2012, after those suicide attempts. Foxconn is the largest private employer in China, with around 400,000 workers at the Longhua factory alone. Yet the report for Apple, complementary to an investigation already being carried out by the Fair Labor Association, admits to looking at just three of those plants for three days apiece. Jenny Chan, one of the foremost scholars of Chinese labour abuses and co-author of the forthcoming Dying for an iPhone, calls it \u201cparachute auditing \u2013 a way to allow \u2018business as usual\u2019 to carry on\u201d. A very profitable way, as it happens. While iPhone workers for Pegatron saw their hourly pay drop to just $1.60 an hour, Apple remained the most profitable big company in America, pulling in over $47bn in profit in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat does this add up to? At $231bn, Apple has a bigger cash pile than the US government, but apparently won\u2019t spend even a sliver on improving conditions for those who actually make its money. Nor will it make those iPhones in America, which would create jobs and still leave it as the most profitable smartphone in the world.\n\nIt would rather accrue more profits, to go to those who hold Apple stock \u2013 such as company boss Tim Cook, whose hoard of company shares is worth $785m. Friends of Cook point to his philanthropy, but while he\u2019s happy to spend on pet projects, he rejects a \u20ac13bn tax bill from the EU as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d \u2013 while boasting about how he won\u2019t bring Apple\u2019s billions back to the US \u201cuntil there\u2019s a fair rate \u2026 It doesn\u2019t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are.\u201d The tech oligarch seems to think he knows better than 300 million Americans what tax rates their elected government should set.\n\nWhen the historians of globalisation ask why it died, they will surely find that companies such as Apple form a large part of the answer. Faced with a binary choice between an economic model that lavishly rewarded a few and a populism that makes lavish promises to many, between Cook on the one hand and Farage on the other, the voters went for the one who at least didn\u2019t bang on about \u201ccourage\u201d."}, "http://www.leftfootforward.org/2014/07/strong-unions-won-you-your-rights-not-kind-hearted-rich-men/": {"title": "Strong unions won you your rights, not kind-hearted rich men", "keywords": ["unison", "strikes", "j10 strikes", "walkout", "pcs", "local government", "unite", "gmb", "nut", "the cuts", "austerity", ""], "url": "http://www.leftfootforward.org/2014/07/strong-unions-won-you-your-rights-not-kind-hearted-rich-men/", "text": "Decent pay and conditions for working people didn't simply fall out of the sky.\n\nDecent pay and conditions for working people didn\u2019t simply drop out of the sky\n\nReading some of the reporting on today\u2019s strike action by public sector workers, you could easily believe that it was trade unionists who caused the worst financial crash since the Great Depression.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t of course, but that\u2019s not stopped the right making use of a good crisis to demonise trade unionists and paint unions as outdated and led by \u2018dinosaurs\u2019.\n\nConservative MPs often make the charge that the Labour Party is \u2018bankrolled\u2019 by the unions:\n\n\u201cMore than half of Labour MPs have had their campaigns bankrolled (that word again) by the trade union threatening to disrupt the lives of millions and bring our economy to its knees,\u201d was how Baroness Warsi scornfully phrased it earlier in this parliament.\n\nYet when people describe the Labour Party as \u2018bankrolled\u2019 by the unions they are actually saying that working people pay for the party \u2013 which is surely how you\u2019d want politics to work under any system.\n\nNo, what the right are really doing when they attempt to play off the public against trade unionists is trying to turn the public on itself. After all, the \u2018millions\u2019 whose \u2018lives are disrupted\u2019 by strikes also presumably have jobs themselves \u2013 jobs with pay and conditions which have at some point been boosted by the existence of unions.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the nub of it: however fashionable it may be to decry the trade unions as relics and \u2018dinosaurs\u2019 of a bygone era, in reality a renaissance in trade unionism is long overdue. Economic growth may have returned but average wages have been falling for years now compared to inflation.\n\nA common myth about trade unionism is that decent pay and conditions are won by bosses being kind rather than workers being rebellious. But history as well as extensive research contradicts this assumption. A recent study from Manchester University shows that countries with a stronger culture of collective bargaining tend on average to have higher minimum wages.\n\nThe widening gap between rich and poor in the past 30 years also reflects the loss of democratic restraint on those at the top. According to a YouGov poll from April, 56 per cent of people would like to see a more equal sharing of income \u2013 even if it reduced the total amount of Britain\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn other words, millions of people \u2013 even many of those inconvenienced by today\u2019s strike \u2013 want to see reduced inequality \u2013 and trade unions are one of the best ways of achieving that. As the graph demonstrates, countries with strong trade union movements tend to be more equal:\n\nAs for the government\u2019s argument that we need a 50 per cent ballot threshold in order for any strike action to be legal: what\u2019s telling is that the people most keen on this have nothing to say on increasing the methods available to unions to ballot members. In other words, they have no interest in making it easier for members to vote in strike ballots, they simply want to make it more difficult to take any kind of industrial action.\n\nNo one on the left should gloss over some of the trade unionism extremism of the 1970s. But we\u2019re a long way away from that era now, and the pendulum has swung much too far the other way. Trade unionism today is almost a dirty word, with politicians of all stripes practiced in a sort of collective amnesia whereby decent pay and conditions for working people simply fell out of the sky or came as a result of kind-hearted rich men.\n\nIt is a fantasy, and those who decry today\u2019s strike action as \u2018politically motivated\u2019 know very well what the real political motivation is in all the talk about ballot thresholds: to take yet more leverage away from working people.\n\nJames Bloodworth is the editor of Left Foot Forward.

These preparations included using paramilitary fascist organizations and the regular army for cross-border raids on northern villages to test the defenses of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nDomestically, the preparation meant carrying out large-scale executions of suspected communists, leftists and anyone who opposed the neo-colonial rule of the U.S. in the south.

Due to the repressive anti-communist National Security Law, which threatened penalties of decades in prison, no one in the south dared to speak up until recently.\n\nA half century of official silence finally began to end after the hard struggle of the pro-democracy movement in the 1980s created a political space. Even those who fled to the U.S. to escape the repression couldn\u2019t speak up. They were dependent on established Korean-Americans for jobs, housing and loans, and these privileged elements often had ties to the right-wing Grand National Party or the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nOne voice through the decades spoke the truth to the world about the mass murders. The press in the DPRK constantly tried to bring these crimes to the attention of the world. Because Washington\u2019s racist anti-DPRK propaganda was all-pervasive, the truth never gained any traction in the corporate mass media around the world.\n\nToday in the RoK, a government-funded Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Ahn Byung-ook is investigating 1,200 incidents of mass executions in addition to 215 cases in which the U.S. military was directly involved in the executions. Of the more than 150 mass graves unearthed so far, the commission has the physical evidence, documentation and eyewitnesses to officially confirm two mass executions at Ulsan and Cheongwon.\n\nThe RoK government now acknowledges that its military, national police and fascist paramilitaries killed over 100,000 civilians at that time, when Korea\u2019s population was 20 million. Kim Dong-choon of the TRC called these government estimates of the human cost of this bloody anti-communist paroxysm \u201cvery conservative.\u201d\n\nThe numbers may be as high as 200,000 people, with some sources putting it as high as 300,000. These numbers do not even include the extra-judicial executions during the war of those RoK puppet troops deemed to be sympathetic to the liberation forces from the DPRK.\n\nRightist ideologues, both in Seoul and Washington, point to alleged massacres carried out by the Korean People\u2019s Army, while denying that the actual proven murders perpetrated by the southern puppet forces even took place. In reality, according to a CIA study dated July 19, 1950, cited by Korea scholar Bruce Cumings, during the occupation of the south by the KPA \u201cNorth Korean officials ran a tight ship but without a lot of bloodshed.\u201d\n\nIn another CIA report from 1950, a \u201clarge percentage\u201d of trade unionists and union leaders joined the KPA only 10 days into the war. DPRK President Kim Il Sung had given a radio address calling on people in the RoK to organize themselves. People\u2019s Committees were formed and went about seizing Japanese and RoK government property as well as that of the rich.\n\nKPA units in the south distributed rice to the people and emptied the jails of political prisoners, who then turned on the cops and the fascist youth groups. KPA troops, in alliance with the poor peasantry, carried out democratic land reform as they swept southwards. Even in the chaos of war, the KPA maintained its discipline. Cumings says that \u201ccaptured North Korean documents continued to show that high-level officials warned against executing people.\u201d\n\nThe same cannot be said of the RoK puppet forces. Before the war even began, the RoK government created the National Guidance League, a fascist-inspired \u201cre-education\u201d corps for people the Rhee dictatorship claimed were communists. By 1950, more than 300,000 people were forced to join the League.\n\nKim Dong-choon says the police or the military executed many of the League\u2019s forced inductees. National Police under Korean Military Advisory Group supervision executed 7,000 people in Yangwol (near Taejon) from July 2-6, 1950.\n\nAlan Winnington of the British Daily Worker in an article entitled \u201cU.S. Belsen in Korea\u201d reported that 20 witnesses observed that truckloads of cops arrived on July 2 and immediately made people dig six pits of about 200 yards each. Executions went on for three days, by both machinegun and, when the bullets ran out, decapitation by sword. According to eyewitnesses, U.S. officers oversaw everything while sitting in their Jeeps. The U.S. Embassy in London then had the chutzpah to call Winnington\u2019s findings a \u201cfabrication.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. military, through its operational command over the RoK army, was involved at the highest level in the executions. New York Times correspondent Charles Grutzner talked about \u201cthe slaughter of hundreds of South Korean civilians, women as well as men, by some U.S. troops and police of the Republic.\u201d\n\nKeyes Beech, in a July 23, 1950, Newark Star-Ledger article wrote: \u201cIt is not the time to be a Korean, for the Yankees are shooting them all.\u201d\n\nDonald Nichols, a former Air Force intelligence officer, wrote in his 1981 memoir of witnessing an \u201cunforgettable massacre\u201d of \u201capproximately 1,800\u201d at Suwon during the war.\n\nIn addition, an investigation made by RoK lawmaker Park Chan-hyun in 1960 during the (relatively) democratic interlude of Chang Myon\u2019s Second Republic revealed that an estimated 10,000 people were executed in Busan.\n\nWhat these horrible, inhuman atrocities reveal is that the puppet RoK dictatorship knew its power rested upon a profoundly shaky foundation. As another quite frank CIA report cited by Cumings noted, the rightist RoK leadership \u201cis provided by that numerically small class which virtually monopolizes the native wealth and education of the country.... Since this class could not have acquired and maintained its favored position under Japanese rule without a certain minimum of \u2018collaboration,\u2019 it has experienced difficulty in finding acceptable candidates for political office and has been forced to support imported expatriate politicians such as Rhee Syngman and Kim Koo. These, while they have no pro-Japanese taint, are essentially demagogues bent on autocratic rule.\u201d\n\nRhee\u2019s venal clique knew that his planned drive north depended upon drowning the patriotic and communist elements in the south in blood. Pockets of communist guerrillas who had fought the Japanese occupation were still active in the south as late as 1950.\n\nAccording to KMAG commander Gen. W.L. Roberts, the RoK puppet army killed 6,000 communist guerrillas from November 1949 to March 1950. Of the attacks on northern border villages carried out by the army and the fascist Northwest Youth paramilitaries that took pace in 1949, Gen. Roberts said that \u201ceach was in our opinion brought on by the presence of a small South Korean salient north of the (38th) parallel.... The South Koreans wish to invade the North.\u201d\n\nDespite the staggering scale of the mass murders carried out by the Rhee puppet regime, patriotic feeling still ran so deep among the Korean people that even in the RoK National Assembly, 48 members declared their allegiance to the DPRK at the end of July 1950.\n\nThe issue of the mass execution of civilians still divides those who are subservient to U.S. neo-colonialism and those who want an independent Korea. Former RoK president Roh Moo-hyun apologized in an official capacity for the 870 confirmed murders at Ulsan, calling them \u201cillegal acts.\u201d In stark contrast, current president Lee Myung-bak, already deeply unpopular, has threatened to cut funding for the TRC.\n\nSeven years ago, the U.S. government finally admitted part of its own guilt, that its soldiers had killed hundreds of innocent civilians in the South Korean township of Nogun-ri shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950.

The crowd roared, pulsing around him like a beating heart. People for whom he had risked his life in war after war hurled blows and insults from all directions. The candidate breathed deeply. Trained as a warrior, he knew he had to stay calm to reach the next phase of his candidacy.\n\nThis ordeal, documented by a Spanish priest in the 1500s, was merely the beginning of the long process of joining the government of the Mesoamerican city of Tlaxcallan, built around 1250 C.E. in the hills surrounding the modern city of Tlaxcala, Mexico. After this trial ended, the candidate would enter the temple on the edge of the plaza and stay for up to 2 years, while priests drilled him in Tlaxcallan's moral and legal code. He would be starved, beaten with spiked whips when he fell asleep, and required to cut himself in bloodletting rituals. But when he walked out of the temple, he would be more than a warrior: He would be a member of Tlaxcallan's senate, one of the 100 or so men who made the city's most important military and economic decisions.\n\n\"I'd like to see modern politicians do all that, just to prove they can govern,\" says archaeologist Lane Fargher, standing in the shadow of one of Tlaxcallan's recently restored elevated plazas. Fargher has led surveys and excavations here since 2007, studying the urban plan and material culture of a type of society many archaeologists once believed they'd never find in Mesoamerica: a republic. \"Twenty or 25 years ago, no one would have accepted it was organized this way,\" says Fargher, who works at the research institute Cinvestav in M\u00e9rida, Mexico.\n\nNow, thanks in part to work led by Fargher's mentor Richard Blanton, an anthropologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, Tlaxcallan is one of several premodern societies around the world that archaeologists believe were organized collectively, where rulers shared power and commoners had a say in the government that presided over their lives.\n\nThese societies were not necessarily full democracies in which citizens cast votes, but they were radically different from the autocratic, inherited rule found\u2014or assumed\u2014in most early societies. Building on Blanton's originally theoretical ideas, archaeologists now say these \"collective societies\" left telltale traces in their material culture, such as repetitive architecture, an emphasis on public space over palaces, reliance on local production over exotic trade goods, and a narrowing of wealth gaps between elites and commoners.\n\n\"Blanton and his colleagues opened up a new way of examining our data,\" says Rita Wright, an archaeologist at New York University in New York City who studies the 5000-year-old Indus civilization in today's India and Pakistan, which also shows signs of collective rule. \"A whole new set of scholarship has emerged about complex societies.\"\n\n\"I think it's a breakthrough,\" agrees Michael E. Smith, an archaeologist at Arizona State University (ASU) in Tempe. \"I've called it the most important work in the archaeology of political organization in the last 20 years.\" He and others are working to extend Blanton's ideas into a testable method, hoping to identify collective states solely through the objects they left behind.\n\nBack in the 1960s, Blanton's teachers and peers didn't think collective societies existed in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Premodern republics such as classical Athens and medieval Venice were thought to be a purely European phenomenon. Conventional wisdom held that in premodern, non-Western societies, despots simply extracted labor and wealth from their subjects.\n\nSome Mesoamerican cultures do seem to fit the despotic model. More than 2000 years ago in the Olmec capitals of San Lorenzo and La Venta along the Mexican gulf coast, for example, kings had their portraits carved into gargantuan stone heads and lived in palaces dripping with exotic luxury goods like greenstone and iron mirrors. Centuries later, Classic period Mayan kings in southern Mexico and Guatemala recorded their conquests, marriages, and dynasties in glyphs carved into stone. Meanwhile, commoners lived humbly in settlements dispersed around the city's core of pyramids and monuments.\n\nBut as Blanton logged year after year of surveys and excavations in Mexico, he noticed an increasingly long list of sites that didn't conform to these expectations. For example, Monte Alb\u00e1n, the capital of the Zapotec people in Oaxaca between 500 B.C.E. and 800 C.E., lacked the ostentatious representations of individual rulers so common in Olmec and classical Maya art. It also seemed to be devoid of palaces and royal tombs stocked with precious goods. Instead, signs of authority were more anonymous, linked to cosmological symbols and enduring deities rather than specific individuals.\n\nIntrigued by such outliers, Blanton and three co-authors worked up a new theory, published in 1996 in Current Anthropology. Based largely on Mesoamerican examples, they laid out two forms that governments could take, which Blanton now terms autocratic and collective. Autocratic governments were based on the authority of an individual ruler and often supported by wealth acquired by monopolizing natural resources or controlling trade. Think of the Olmec, who controlled key gulf coast trade routes, or even present-day Saudi Arabia, Blanton says, \"where the royal family controls the oil industry and uses that to fund the state's activity. They don't have to be accountable to the people.\"\n\nCollective systems emphasized the office of the ruler, which in theory could be occupied by anyone in the society: Leaders were made, not born. Taxes rather than external wealth funded the state and its leaders. Tlaxcallan, with its political initiation rite to bring people from all classes into the governing council, had a collective government. So do the United States and India. \"Collective\" in this usage does not mean \"socialist,\" Blanton adds. Most of the collective societies he has studied have marketbased economies, which create taxpayers rich enough to contribute to public goods.\n\nBlanton's perspective \"was very stimulating,\" Wright says. \"For a very long time within archaeology, we'd been looking for markers of a king.\" Now, researchers had a theory for making sense of seemingly kingless societies. But to study ancient societies without historical records, archaeologists need to know what distinctive material traces such a collective society might leave behind. \"What would it actually look like on the ground\u2014that was a big problem,\" Blanton says. \"How would we recognize these states?\"\n\n\"Over there is where we found the house,\" Fargher says. He skirts the platform that once held one of Tlaxcallan's largest public plazas and heads to a patch of bare earth surrounded by green grass. In the distance Popocat\u00e9petl, Mexico's most famous volcano, gently puffs smoke into the clear winter sky.\n\nFargher points to faint rocky lines in the sandy earth, where walls stood 600 years ago. \"It was a series of small rooms that were rebuilt several times, with a patio over here,\" he says, moving through the compact space. By all appearances it was nothing special, a typical house for a typical commoner.\n\n\"But look where we are,\" Fargher says. \"Right in front of a very public space. In any other Mesoamerican site, next to the principal plaza you'd have an enormous palace. Here we have a pretty humble house.\"\n\nSuch reversals are par for the course in Tlaxcallan, Fargher says. \"This is like Superman's Bizarro World. Everything is the inverse of what you expect for Mesoamerica.\"\n\nMost Mesoamerican cities were centered on a monumental core of pyramids and plazas. In Tlaxcallan, the plazas were scattered throughout every neighborhood, with no clear center or hierarchy. Rather than ruling from the heart of the city, as kings did, Fargher believes Tlaxcallan's senate likely met in a grand building he found standing alone 1 kilometer outside the city limits. This distributed layout is also a sign of shared political power, he says.\n\nArchaeologists have unearthed versions of this unusual layout in a handful of other Mesoamerican cities. One is the city of Tres Zapotes along the gulf coast, which flourished from 400 B.C.E. to 300 C.E., in the centuries immediately following the fall of La Venta, the last Olmec capital. Although the citizens of Tres Zapotes retained many Olmec cultural practices, their city looked nothing like the capitals that came before, says Christopher Pool, an archaeologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington who has spent the last 20 years excavating there. Instead of being centered on an opulent palace, Tres Zapotes had four plazas regularly spaced throughout the city. Each one had the same layout of earthen pyramids and public spaces, and radiocarbon dates revealed they were occupied at the same time. Pool concluded that during its height, four factions cooperated to govern Tres Zapotes.\n\nCollective societies tend to lay out their cities in standardized ways, with the largest ones even using grids, says Blanton, which ease navigation both for residents and for a government providing services. In the Indus capital of Mohenjo-daro in today\u2019s Pakistan, for example, the art depicts few individual people, and houses built with standard-sized bricks line regularly spaced city blocks. The strict urban plan incorporated wells and allowed thousands of people to use toilets connected to the world\u2019s first sewers.\n\nAnother common feature of collective societies is economic equality, which archaeologists can infer from comparing the goods of rich and poor people. In autocratic societies like the classical Maya, luxury goods such as intricately painted pottery and jade are only found in palaces and royal tombs. In contrast, in Tlaxcallan people of all classes seemed to have owned and used pottery with ornate, multicolor designs. \"You can't tell rich people from poor people based on their stuff,\" Fargher says. Pool sees a similarly narrow wealth gap at Tres Zapotes. And in classical Athens, perhaps the most famous premodern democracy, \"wealthy people lived in houses that were similar to the common people,\" Blanton says.\n\nBut ASU's Smith cautions that economic equality doesn't guarantee that political power is shared at the top. \"There is an association [between them], but that doesn't make inequality a measure of collectivity, or the reverse,\" he says. And although he agrees that a city's layout offers clues to governance, he notes that excavations often focus on a site's central core and may miss outlying plazas. To firm up the link, archaeologists need more data from the outskirts of cities and more rigorous statistical methods to interpret them, he says.\n\nBy the time a candidate underwent Tlaxcallan's political initiation rite, he had already proved his valor in war. For centuries the state was locked in battle against the Mexica Empire, whose capital Tenochtitlan lay just over the mountains to the west. There, in what is now Mexico City, a noble lineage of kings ruled from a grand central plaza. Tlaxcallan was the only polity in the region that fended off Mexica control, turning it into something of an economic and political island.\n\nHistorical sources say the Mexica (called the Aztecs today) imposed a trade blockade to weaken their rivals. Although Fargher has found that some imperial goods, like salt and green obsidian, still flowed into Tlaxcallan, out of 10 tons of ceramics he has uncovered in the city, only three or four pieces are Mexica style. The ratio of carbon isotopes in skeletons recovered from under the plazas indicates that corn\u2014which could be locally produced and stored\u2014dominated people's diets to an exceptional degree, even in corn-rich Mesoamerica. All this suggests that Tlaxcallan must have relied on its own citizens, rather than trade or natural resources, to fund its activities.\n\nNo written sources chronicle the economy of Tres Zapotes. But there, too, imported goods were scarce, Pool says, which means that the four ruling factions also must have relied on internal resources. The pattern is a stark contrast to its predecessor La Venta, where autocratic rulers controlled trade and enjoyed exotic luxuries.\n\nBoth cities support Blanton and Fargher's belief that the best predictor of collective rule is a strong internal revenue source\u2014that is, taxes. Revenue sources are admittedly difficult to detect from artifacts and buildings. But after surveying 30 premodern societies documented ethnographically and historically, the researchers found that states with internal revenue sources were characterized by a high level of public goods and services, a strong governmental bureaucracy, and citizens empowered to judge the ruler's actions. \"When taxpayers are paying for the state, then the people in charge know they have to do the right thing,\" Blanton says.\n\nCollective states may have another tendency that can be spotted archaeologically: They attract people from beyond their borders, who bring artifacts that can be linked to other cultures. \"When you have a collective formation that's funded by internal resources, it's in the interest of those in government to bring in more people,\" says Gary Feinman, an archaeologist at The Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois, and a co-author on Blanton's 1996 paper. Economic equality and markets may also attract immigrants to collective societies. \"People move where they think there's better opportunity\u2014where they can make a living, where their kids are going to do better than they did. That's always a motivation,\" Feinman says.\n\nTlaxcallan was home to several different ethnic groups, many of whom were refugees fleeing Mexica domination, according to the Spanish chronicles. \"They were absorbed by Tlaxcallan on the condition that they defend the state,\" says Aurelio L\u00f3pez Corral, the archaeologist who leads Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History's work at the site. The best warriors, no matter their ethnicity, were eligible to join the senate\u2014if they could endure the initiation. \"It's the opposite of ethnic nationalism,\" says archaeologist David Carballo of Boston University (BU).\n\nThe evidence isn't always so easy to read, however. About 100 kilometers from Tlaxcallan lies a very different monumental site: Teotihuacan, which dominated central Mexico between about 100 C.E. and 550 C.E. The broad Avenue of the Dead bisects the city, lined with imposing structures including the enormous Pyramids of the Sun, Moon, and Feathered Serpent. \"This is a grand city,\" says archaeologist Saburo Sugiyama at Aichi Prefectural University in Nagakute, Japan, who has excavated some of the city's most iconic places, including the pyramids. \"There was a very strong rulership that planned and executed this monumental project.\" He envisions this leader as a typical autocrat\u2014a king who wielded great military might\u2014based partly on weapons and bellicose imagery found together with the remains of a mass human sacrifice and burial in the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent.\n\nYet Linda Manzanilla, an archaeologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City who has been excavating at Teotihuacan since the 1970s, sees the exact same city in a different way. She notes that it is laid out in a grid, with common citizens living in standardized apartment buildings distributed regularly throughout it. Major avenues divided the city into four quadrants, she says. Each quadrant had its own iconography\u2014flying animals, felines, serpents, or coyotes\u2014that dominated its art and ceramics; under the centrally located Pyramid of the Moon, sacrificed animals from each group were found together. The art depicts no individual leaders or dynasties, and Manzanilla argues that Teotihuacan was governed by a council of four leaders, each representing a different quadrant\u2014a type of collective government. At Teotihuacan, \"Groups are more important than individuals,\" she says.\n\nThe different interpretations highlight the challenges of applying Blanton's model. Smith notes that there is always some ambiguity about the political significance of a site's physical features. For example, the Indus civilization's standardized housing and sophisticated water control systems can be seen as signs of shared power, but they have also been interpreted as evidence of totalitarian control. \"Until someone comes up with a model that's rigorous and accepted by everyone, in my mind this is all going to be fairly subjective and speculative,\" Smith says.\n\nBU's Carballo argues that the form of government may not even be the most important measure of what Blanton terms collectivity. He points to an enormous obsidian workshop he excavated in an outlying neighborhood of Teotihuacan as a sign that commoners organized themselves at the grassroots level, no matter who ruled from the Avenue of the Dead. That makes Teotihuacan a collective society, even if it turns out to have had a single king, he argues.\n\nIt may be that societies like Teotihuacan simply don't fall into neat categories, Pool says. Or they may shift strategies over time. At Tres Zapotes, for example, elite factions may have shared power within the city, but the capital dominated nearby towns, which all had one central plaza modeled on the Tres Zapotes layout. Then, slowly, autocracy crept back into Tres Zapotes itself. Around 1 C.E., the four plaza groups lost their architectural coherence and individual rulers once again appeared in the city's art.\n\nCollective governments do tend to rise and fall in cycles, Blanton says. In Oaxaca, the political pendulum swung between collectivity and autocracy every 200 to 300 years, judging from shifts in the layouts of dominant sites and histories recorded by colonial chroniclers. \"Democracy isn't a one-shot deal that happened one time. It comes and goes, and it's very difficult to sustain,\" he says.\n\nHistory had a special irony in store for the republic of Tlaxcallan when the Spanish arrived. After centuries of resisting the Mexica Empire, the Tlaxcaltecas finally saw an opportunity to destroy their enemies. They allied with conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, helping him plan attacks on Tenochtitlan and sheltering his army after its initial crushing defeat, which allowed the Spanish forces to regroup and try again\u2014this time successfully. \"I'm not sure the conquest would have been possible without Tlaxcallan assistance,\" Fargher says.\n\nBut as soon as the Tlaxcaltecas became subjects of the Spanish crown, the republic was gone. People abandoned their hilltop plazas and moved down into the valley, settling the modern city of Tlaxcala.

Another 41 were murdered between 2010 and 2012. The rest was executed and victoriously reported as combat kills under Uribe\u2019s watch in what in 2008 became known as the \u201cfalse positives\u201d scandal.\n\nTo make the slowly emerging truth even more inconvenient, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Santos was defense minister between 2006 and 2009, the years in which the security forces executed 2,364 civilians, according to an earlier prosecution report.\n\nBoth Uribe and Santos have long known that the International Criminal Court is not interested in soldiers or rank and file guerrillas, but demands \u2014 as international humanitarian law requires \u2014 that those \u201cultimately responsible\u201d be punished.\n\nThis could explain why the association of retired generals Acore has so vehemently opposed the peace process and why Uribe has long sought a Nuremberg Trial-type partisan justice in which justice is imposed only on one actor in the war.\n\nBecause \u2014 once the Transitional Justice Court takes force \u2014 Uribe will have to respond not just for the paramilitary massacre in El Aro, and the (para)military operations \u201cGenesis\u201d in 1997 and \u201cOrion\u201d in 2002. He will also be called to trial to explain the 4,000 homicides committed when he was commander in chief.\n\nIn what appears to be a desperate attempt to evade justice, the former president has pushed every possible button to either discredit or de-legitimize the peace peace process.\n\nBut time is running out for Uribe.\n\nColombia\u2019s Congress is set to pass the necessary legislation for the implementation of the transitional justice system on January 16 after which it should take six months for the court to have its first hearing.\n\nFrom then on, Colombians are going to be crudely confronted by the mass killings carried out under the political responsibility of the former commander-in-chief who can still counts on the support of more than 15% of the electorate.\n\nWhile Uribe enjoys presidential immunity for the more than 4,000 murders committed under his watch, the Truth Commission could mean the political death of the current senator who only three years ago was voted to become the \u201cGreatest Colombian in History.\u201d\n\nThe Truth Commission and the Transitional Justice Tribunal will not just investigate homicides, but a series of war crimes including kidnapping, sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers, crimes primarily perpetrated by the FARC, according to the National Center for Historical Memory.\n\nColombia military assassinated more civilians under Uribe than FARC did in 30 years: records was last modified: by"}, "http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/02/23/to-move-forward-we-must-stop-enabling-the-democratic-party-progressives-elections/": {"title": "To Move Forward, We Must Stop Enabling The Democratic Party", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/02/23/to-move-forward-we-must-stop-enabling-the-democratic-party-progressives-elections/", "text": "This story is part of The Establishment\u2019s ongoing series exploring the political dialogue surrounding the democratic presidential candidates, progressivism, and feminism.\n\nJust say you\u2019ll vote for the Democratic nominee. Just SAY it.\n\nWhy do you have to rock the boat in an election year? This election is too important.\n\nJust help us get Democrats into office, and THEN you can call them out on their problems.\n\nI know the system is messed up, but we have to be realistic.\n\nIf you don\u2019t shut up, we\u2019ll end up with President Trump!\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever criticized the Democratic Party from the left, as I recently did, chances are good you\u2019ve heard all of this and more. It\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s unavoidable.\n\nThe left is willing to think big and question the status quo \u2014 three out of every four years. Then we get to an election year and, OMG, we have to make sure the Democrats win no matter how terrible their candidates are, because this is the most important election ever (it\u2019s always the most important election ever). That the Republicans always seem to run cartoon villains like Trump and Cruz helps a lot with this argument. But our system is so profoundly undemocratic that even when we win, we lose: Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush v. Gore put the cartoon villain into the White House. (At which point Hillary Clinton poured her energy into lobbying him to invade Iraq.)\n\nI have strong criticisms of Clinton and of Sanders \u2014 but in the end, it\u2019s not about them, it\u2019s about the two-party system as a whole. Don\u2019t hate the players, hate the game.\n\nIt\u2019s important to defend Hillary Clinton from the sexist abuse fired at her from the right. Clinton has faced probably more sexism than just about any other woman in U.S. history (with the exception of Monica Lewinsky). I will gladly defend her against that, and I won\u2019t deny that it\u2019d be a pleasure to see a woman president \u2014 just as it\u2019s a pleasure to see Hillary dismissing the right-wing conspiracy theorists, taking charge, and refusing to be bullied. But that momentary pleasure can\u2019t take precedence over the actual material consequences her actions have in the world.\n\nWhen we examine those actions, it\u2019s easy to build a case against Clinton from the left. She was never a progressive. She started her career as a Republican \u201cGoldwater Girl\u201d and continued it as a member of Walmart\u2019s board during a major antiunion campaign.\n\nAs First Lady she took an unprecedented role in actively promoting her husband\u2019s political agenda, which included passing a crime bill that vastly expanded the prison system and \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws; expanding the death penalty; escalating the drug war; and gutting the welfare system.\n\nAs Secretary of State she reoriented the State Department\u2019s priorities in favor of helping U.S. corporations increase profits and avoid labor-rights regulations overseas; personally approved illegal surveillance of UN personnel, allies, and diplomats as part of the largest mass surveillance program in history; helped dictators in countries like Egypt, Tunisia, and Bahrain stand up against the Arab Spring movements for democratic and human rights; supported the antidemocratic coup against Honduran president Manuel Zelaya; and expanded a drone-bombing campaign that\u2019s killed hundreds of civilians. She counts war criminal Henry Kissinger as a mentor and friend.\n\nMost Clinton supporters respond to these criticisms not by defending the indefensible, but by criticizing the alternative: Bernie Sanders. What he wants to do simply isn\u2019t realistic, they say. He\u2019ll never get anything done, the Republicans will obstruct him every step of the way, and all will be lost, almost as lost as it would be under President Trump.\n\nThis is, of course, correct.\n\nThe Republicans have obstructed President Obama at every possible opportunity for the past eight years: the House has voted more than 60 times on bills attempting to block various aspects of Obamacare. It\u2019s abundantly clear that this will be their strategy as long as any Democrat is in office; a President Sanders would certainly face it, and so would a second President Clinton. \u201cBernie can\u2019t,\u201d they say \u2014 and Hillary won\u2019t, so where does that leave us?\n\nWe elect a Democrat with a mandate for change, and the Republicans block that change by any means necessary. Then a frustrated electorate swings back toward the Republicans in the midterms, closing the window of legislative opportunity. Or we elect a Republican, and for four years we hear about how much better things would have been if only we\u2019d elected a Democrat.\n\nEither way, though, we can count on the prison system continuing to expand, the health-care system remaining broken, drones continuing to bomb civilian weddings around the Middle East and Central Asia, and the unending expansion of the most sweeping system of mass surveillance the world has ever known.\n\nBut shut up about all that, we\u2019re told, and vote for the Democratic nominee.\n\nI\u2019m not Feeling the Bern, but I am very glad to see a self-proclaimed socialist garnering such support (even if we have very different ideas about what \u201csocialism\u201d means). I\u2019m glad Bernie\u2019s pushing the debate to the left, raising demands that would be common sense in Europe but are considered radical here in the United States, like free tuition at public universities. As comedian Hari Kondabolu has astutely pointed out, in this political environment, candidates have to propose measures far beyond what they expect to achieve in order to make even small steps in a progressive direction \u2014 so these proposals are welcome interventions.\n\nThese discussions about what Hillary or Bernie will be able to achieve, though, leave out a crucial factor. Democratic partisans are so focused on what\u2019s happening on the Hill and inside the Beltway that they seem to forget there\u2019s a whole country out there, one where people are indebted and incarcerated and unemployed and angry. And what those people do affects what happens in Washington.\n\nRichard Nixon. Remember him? Even if you don\u2019t, you know his reputation: the jowly, paranoid archconservative who, with Kissinger at his side, not only stayed in Vietnam but secretly bombed Cambodia and Laos, worked to undermine the Black Power movement, and notoriously abused his power at home and abroad. What you might not know is that Nixon also proposed a guaranteed minimum annual income for all Americans and, as Lance Selfa summarizes in his book The Democrats: A Critical History, increased food-stamp funding, approved a 20% increase in Social Security payments, created Supplemental Security Income, and established a number of regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Nixon expanded domestic spending more than any Democratic president since FDR.\n\nOh, yes, and Roe v. Wade happened on Nixon\u2019s watch.\n\nRead that list again. It sounds a bit like Sanders\u2019 platform, doesn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s far to the left of anything Clinton proposes. Today\u2019s Republican politicians would greet this with howls of \u201cCommunism!\u201d \u2014 and, let\u2019s be real, so would more than a few mainstream Democrats.\n\nNixon wasn\u2019t a progressive. But his presidency, which stretched from 1969 to his resignation in 1974, took place during an era of mass social movements that affected every aspect of U.S. life. The women\u2019s movement, Black Power, Chicano Power, the Gay Liberation Front, the American Indian Movement, Students for a Democratic Society \u2014 oppressed groups of all kinds were organizing. The environmental movement and the labor movement were fermenting. Cities all over the U.S. saw urban uprisings as people took to the streets.\n\nThey weren\u2019t marching or rioting to get Democrats into office. They were raising concrete demands like independent living for people with disabilities and wages for housework and full employment. Progress happened during the Nixon administration not because Nixon wanted it to \u2014 he very much did not \u2014 but because there was intense pressure on him and on Washington in general to fix what was broken.\n\nHoward Zinn, the radical historian who gave us A People\u2019s History of the United States, used to say that \u201cwhat matters most is not who is sitting in the White House, but who is sitting in.\u201d The lesson is clear: focus on the streets and you can force even a conservative administration to change its course. But pour all your resources into electoral politics in the hopes of influencing the party (an idea that still gets some currency among Sanders supporters today), or act as if electoral politics are the only politics, and you create a situation where the only pressure on your elected progressives is coming from the right. And so the whole framework of the debate shifts further and further to the right. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen again and again. When Democrats know they can take left-wing votes for granted, the only pressure they respond to comes from the right.\n\nThe result has been that, in the past three decades \u2014 over the lifetimes of the young people whose votes Clinton and Sanders covet \u2014 both the Democrats and the Republicans have shifted far to the right. The Reagan/Bush era, with the rise of the Religious Right, saw Democrats chasing pathetically after evangelical votes \u2014 so that by 1992, Bill Clinton was running a presidential campaign by promising to \u201cget tough on crime.\u201d He even rushed home from the campaign trail to personally oversee the execution of an African American man named Ricky Ray Rector, whose suicide attempt had left him so mentally disabled that he asked at his last meal whether he might save his dessert until after the execution. Clinton epitomized this rightward swing so much that, as Donna Murch recently noted, Alan Greenspan once called him \u201cthe best Republican president we\u2019ve had in a while.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that we have a two-party system with one party on the left and one on the right, and it\u2019s irresponsible and wrong to keep pretending that. What we have are a far-right party and a right-centrist party.\n\nBernie Sanders is attempting to turn that shift around by appealing to the Democrats\u2019 long-undeserved reputation as the left-wing party. Good luck to him. His detractors in the Clinton camp say that he can\u2019t bring about a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d (whatever that means) from the Oval Office. They\u2019re right.\n\nWhat a Sanders victory would bring about is a symbolic victory. Would it bring real change? Probably no more than Obama\u2019s victory did. But it would represent a massive wave of dissatisfaction with Washington politics as usual and highlight the crying need for real, \u201860s-style (and \u201830s-style) militant organizing to fill the political vacuum on the left. Whether or not that kind of organizing materializes is up to us. But it\u2019s imperative we understand that it\u2019s certainly not going to come from Washington.\n\nThe far right understands the importance of organizing on the ground. Hate groups and armed militias are on the rise and becoming more violent, particularly in targeting immigrants, LGBTQ people, and Muslims (or those perceived as Arab or Muslim). They might seem like fringe extremists, but they\u2019re having an effect on the Republican message, as Trump\u2019s popularity shows.\n\nThey\u2019ve been successful at this before, as Katha Pollitt explains:\n\nThe result was that, while in the 1970s many Republicans counted themselves as pro-choice, today such a position is completely unthinkable in the party. Even Democrats like Hillary Clinton concede that abortion is \u201ctragic\u201d and should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d \u2014 thus allowing right-wingers to set the terms of the debate. And why shouldn\u2019t she, if she knows that pro-choice voters will support her no matter what?\n\nIf we win real change, it will be won in the streets, through movements like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, not on the Hill \u2014 or even in the Supreme Court. Though I\u2019d like to see Obama tack left for the nomination, which will face Republican obstruction no matter what, looking to the Court, a notorious bulwark against democracy, for actual progress is a terrible idea. Rob Hunter recently explained why in Jacobin:\n\nSo if you want to tell me it\u2019s important than ever to throw my energy behind the Democratic nominee, I\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s more important than ever to throw your energy behind independently organized grassroots movements.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter network, following a precedent set in the 1960s by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, has decided not to endorse any candidates in this election, choosing instead to \u201ckeep up its political activism by confronting candidates about the treatment of African Americans in the U.S.\u201d and advocate for specific demands, such as a system for tracking police misconduct, says activist Darnell Moore. \u201cSometimes you have to put a wrench in the gears to get people to listen,\u201d activist Alicia Garza told the Guardian. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is an attempt by mainstream politics and politicians to co-opt movements. We don\u2019t think that playing a corrupt game is going to bring change and make black lives matter.\u201d\n\nThis is the part where you tell me that I\u2019m being impossibly idealistic, because to make things better, we have to focus on the realities of how politics gets done. But if you think that how politics gets done in this country is going to result in a better country, then I have to tell you, you\u2019re the idealist.\n\nAs if crises of debt, mass imprisonment, health care, and economic hardship were not dire enough, we now face a planet-wide climate crisis that can\u2019t be slowed down without radical action in the very near future. We no longer have time to wait around for Washington.\n\nStop enabling the Democratic Party. It\u2019s the biggest thing standing between the left and real change.\n\nMore stories from The Establishment\u2019s political series:\n\nLet\u2019s Not Pretend Electing The First Female President Wouldn\u2019t Be Radical\n\nNo, White Women, I Will Not Be Voting For Hillary\n\nWhy I Prefer Bernie\u2019s Revolution To Hillary\u2019s Boardroom Feminism\n\nWhen It Comes To Discussing Gender In Politics, Everyone Is Losing\n\nTo Move Forward, We Must Stop Enabling The Democratic Party"}, "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/multiple-injuries-reported-shooting-houston-shopping-mall-article-1.2806725": {"title": "Texas lawyer in Nazi uniform opens fire at strip mall, 9 injured", "keywords": ["Houston", " houston mall shooting", " nathan desai", " shopping mall shooting", " active shooter houston texas"], "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/multiple-injuries-reported-shooting-houston-shopping-mall-article-1.2806725", "text": "A Houston lawyer wearing a Nazi uniform \u2014 who neighbors claimed had recently been acting paranoid \u2014 opened fire near a strip mall, wounding nine people before he was shot dead by police, authorities said.\n\nShots rang out around 6:30 a.m. Monday in southwest Houston near an intersection with a grocery store, Walgreens and Chuck E.

The news stories offer largely the same account and framing as that given by the LA Times: \"hundreds of pro-Trump demonstrators and counter-protesters clashed Saturday at a 'Patriots Day' rally\u2026 Both groups threw rocks and sticks at each other and used a large trash bin as a battering ram\u2026 Twenty-one people were arrested\u2026 Eleven people were injured.\"\n\nAll of this did happen. But such accounts missed the most crucial aspects of what was at stake in the Berkeley clashes, and thus fail to explain why there were aggressive altercations at all. To frame Saturday's events as a fight between supporters of the president and his denouncers roundly misses the key tensions undergirding the confrontation: that of anti-fascists versus white nationalists.\n\nThis is not to say that each or even the majority, of the hundreds of pro-Trump attendees sympathize with the Venn Diagram of white supremacist, alt-right, anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi groups which intersect with the president's broader support base. But as firsthand testimonies, numerous images and videos shared on social media can attest, explicitly racist groups and individuals were present in force, some having traveled from out of state to attend. Equally, the masked, black clad anti-fascist protesters did not amass in Berkeley to confront a gathering of people who just happened to vote for Trump. Their presence followed calls to action, which had named the specific far right and neo-Nazi alliances that were planning to attend, and indeed helped organize, the \"Patriots Day\" rally. The violence from both the far left and far right rested on a fulcrum that, while emphasized in the Trump era, far predates his presidency; anti-fascists have long met white supremacists with force in the streets.\n\nMedia reports relying on the \"pro-Trump versus anti-Trump\" framing missed some glaring and more subtle cues about the nature of Saturday's protests. Multiple demonstrators, some of whom donned Make America Great Again hats, performed Nazi salutes in full public view.\n\nThe sign reading \"Da Goyim Know\" is no dog whistle\u2014it's an anti-Semitic foghorn. And it was not a lone nut job carrying the sign to express his own fringe hate. The placard was a part of a series of banners made and carried by dozens of people, all in the same design and style, but some with more veiled messages, such as \"Defend America.\"\n\nImages from the day shared on Twitter also show the presence of numerous flags featuring (the alt-right mascot), as well as the flag of \" an alt-right, meme infused appropriation of the Nazi Ensign. A group of anti-fascist street medics who go by \"Pastel Bloc\" on Twitter told me that they saw members of the so-called pro-Trump crowd throwing bagels at counter-protesters as an anti-semitic taunt. One neo-Nazi, raising his right arm to Heil for the camera, carried a flag bearing the black sun of Odinism, a paganist symbol common in Nazi mythology.\n\nThe Proud Boys, an alt-right subset boasting a philosophy of \"Western Chauvinism,\" handed out recruitment and for pictures with members and leaders from the white supremacist group Identity Evropa, which preaches that America belongs to the white race.\n\nThe group's leader, Nathan Damigo, who was convicted in 2007 for pointing a gun at and and robbing a Muslim cab driver he believed to be Iraqi, made his presence known on Saturday. He was caught on video sucker punching a small, female-presenting anti-fascist protester in the face. Damigo has stated that, \"black people are inferior to whites, genetically.\"\n\n\"The far right is holding it down in Berkeley right now,\" tweeted Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer, who was at the scene, an image of demonstrators swaddled in Trumpist, patriotic and explicitly far right symbolism. \"Hail Victory!\" tweeted neo-Nazi Richard Spencer in response.\n\nBauer also noted that a number of Trump supporters expressed discomfort at their co-protesters' racist and anti-semitic views and demonstrations. But it was not for these more moderate Trump supporters that the anti-fascist and anarchist groups came. As was the case in two previous instances in Berkeley since Trump's inauguration, anti-fascists were responding specifically to the presence of white nationalists and neo-Nazis. First, militant protests a talk planned by far right troll Milo Yiannopolous, and then anti-fascists disrupted a March 4 rally the alt-right Proud Boys.\n\nIn advance of the \"Patriots Day\" demonstration, anti-fascist news and watchdog site It's Going Down a story detailing the connections between the organizers of Saturday's rally and the right's racist (not-so-)fringe. A group going by the name called for the event in a YouTube video, and chose the venue\u2014MLK Civic Center Park (of all places to beckon the far right). The group claimed to be non-violent but prepared to \"defend\" patriots. In a promotional flier, the group named a series of planned speakers, most of whom, according to research from It's Going Down, have strong alt-right affiliations and have espoused white nationalist views.\n\nBrittany Pettibone, for example, is a contributor to AltRight.com, a white nationalist hub. Another, Tim Treadstone, who goes by the pseudonym Baked Alaska, once \"Me: Upon research, I noticed Jewish people run 95 percent of American media that is very interesting; Internet: Why do you want to gas the Jews?\" and has even been deemed too much of an explicit neo-Nazi for far right conspiracist Mike Cernovich. The white nationalist figure known as Based Stick Man, real name Kyle Chapman, was arrested at the event. It's Going Down noted that Identity Evropa and the Proud Boys were planning to join the rally.\n\nIt's Going Down, a relied-upon source for anti-fascists around the country, warned that the event\u2014which was not the first and will not be the last iteration of such tensions\u2014would be a \"crucible for a new fascist movement\" hidden in the \"smokescreen\" of a diverse Trump support base. The issue is not whether the rally crowd also drew Trump supporters of color, or many Trump fans who claim to despise white nationalism. A media narrative that overlooks significant white supremacist presence de facto demonizes the counter-protesters who came to confront it."}, "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism-robots_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067": {"title": "Stephen Hawking Says We Should Really Be Scared Of Capitalism, Not Robots", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism-robots_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067", "text": "Machines won\u2019t bring about the economic robot apocalypse \u2015 but greedy humans will, according to physicist Stephen Hawking.\n\nIn a Reddit Ask Me Anything session on Thursday, the scientist predicted that economic inequality will skyrocket as more jobs become automated and the rich owners of machines refuse to share their fast-proliferating wealth.\n\nIf machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed.

So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.\n\nEssentially, machine owners will become the bourgeoisie of a new era, in which the corporations they own won\u2019t provide jobs to actual human workers.\n\nAs it is, the chasm between the super rich and the rest is growing. For starters, capital \u2015 such as stocks or property \u2015 accrues value at a much faster rate than the actual economy grows, according to the French economist Thomas Piketty.

It\u2019s just shocking. The shock of it all is starting to set in. It\u2019s like this dude really hit me and they let him get away with it. I was basically in police custody and got hit.\u201d\n\nSwain, however, said he didn\u2019t think the officers who were filmed coming up the stairs saw what happened to Jones.\n\nThe incident is now the subject of an internal review, Swain said. Authorities are combing through video footage of the rally and conducting interviews to try to determine what happened.\n\n\u201cNo one should be subjected to such a cowardly, unprovoked act as that committed by McGraw,\u201d Sheriff Earl Butler said in a statement posted to Facebook. \u201cRegardless of political affiliation, speech, race, national origin, color, gender, bad reputation, prior acts, or political demonstration, no other citizen has the right to assault another person or to act in such a way as this defendant did.

But he said they were almost immediately surrounded by eight Cumberland County sheriff officers, who escorted them out.

The Fayetteville Police Department also told The Post it did not detain anyone at the rally, held at the city\u2019s Crown Coliseum.

I will say this. We have 25 [thousand], 30,000 people. You\u2019ve seen it yourself.

That was the foundation of slavery so our country has been based on that as well as the genocide of native Americans.\" Kaepernick was asked if he was equating incarceration with breaking up families. \"I\u2019m equating the breaking up of families with the breaking up of families,\" he said.\n\nKaepernick has been heavily scrutinized for his protests.

According to Jacobs\u2019analysis, 74% of billionaire wealth in America was gained through rent-seeking, or socially useless activity.\n\nThere has always been a tension between America\u2019s meritocratic mythology and the blatant evidence of a thoroughly rigged economy. After the 2008 financial crisis where bankers brought the economy to its knees through reckless and criminal behavior only to end up richer after a taxpayer funded bailout, the contradictions between the myth and the reality became harder to ignore.\n\nEven mainstream establishment publications like The New Yorker started asking, \u201cWhat Good Is Wall Street?\u201d Why is a sector of the economy that creates nothing running the real economy and taking home such a large portion of national income?\n\nWhat Jacobs reveals is that most of the wealth that has propelled people into the top 1% and beyond was gained not through the creation economic benefit, but through rent-seeking. Economic rents are obtained when someone is able to extract wealth or excessive returns despite no additional contribution to productivity, or what could be called socially useless activity.\n\nJacobs then identifies the industries in which rent-seeking is most significant: those heavily reliant on the state, like oil, gas and mining, gambling, or forestry, and industries that involve a lot of imperfect information and market failures, like finance, IT, and the music and fashion industry.\n\nAnd, of course, much billionaire wealth is inherited, making it hard to argue meritocracy plays much of a role at all. Taking all of this data into account, Jacobs concludes:\n\nThe bottom-line is that extreme wealth is not broad-based: it is disproportionately generated by a small portion of the economy. Economic theory predicts that activities that are prone to rent-seeking or market failures will concentrate wealth, and that is what we observe. This finding has important moral, economic, and policy implications. To the extent that it is driven by rents as opposed to productive activities, the extreme concentration of wealth we observe is not fair according to a meritocratic conception of social justice. Moreover, because rents do not compensate productive activities, redistributing them through taxes or regulation does not harm the economy, and could even boost economic growth. As wealth inequality has become so extreme, even modest redistribution could have significant positive impact for the poor and the middle class.\n\nThat last part is a big deal. Because the rich are getting extremely rich from socially useless activity, taxing them does not threaten economic productivity. The traditional trade-offs between production and taxes on wealth and income is that high taxes hurt productivity and, therefore, ultimately hurt the people redistributive programs are supposed to help. That claim has always been dubious, but based on Jacob\u2019s analysis, the opposite might be true: taxing the 1% will provide revenue for social programs while also leveling out problematic sectors of the economy that provide no real value anyway.\n\nWe all learned in 2008 that, contrary to corporate claims, Wall Street could not \u201cself-regulate.\u201d Now it seems regulating and taxing Wall Street and other economic parasites can both create stability and fund programs to make America a more equal society.

Burnout. Attrition. It's Time To Address The National Teacher Shortage\n\nThe good news: There's an uptick in the hiring of new teachers since the pink-slip frenzy in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe bad news: The new hiring hasn't made up for the teacher shortfall. Attrition is high, and enrollment in teacher preparation programs has fallen some 35 percent over the past five years \u2014 a decrease of nearly 240,000 teachers in all. \n\n\n\nParts of most every state in America face troubling teacher shortages: the most frequent shortage areas are math, science, bilingual education and special education.\n\nWe've covered many sides of the shortage issue, including the disconnect between training and districts' needs; how the accountability obsession and paperwork are driving some good veteran teachers away; what factors help teachers stick around; as well as efforts to improve training for special-ed teachers to stem that field's attrition and chronic shortage.\n\nTwo comprehensive new reports on the issue, from the nonprofit and nonpartisan Learning Policy Institute, offer an opportunity to revisit and dig deeper into a widening problem. You can read the full reports \u2014 A Coming Crisis in Teaching? Teacher Supply, Demand, and Shortages in the U.S and Minority Teacher Recruitment, Employment, and Retention: 1987 to 2013 \u2014 here. Also, check out the institute's interactive map.\n\nI spoke with the institute's president, Linda Darling-Hammond, professor of education emeritus at Stanford University and co-author of one of the reports.\n\nWhether this is a full-blown \"crisis\" or just one of many problems in education depends, I guess, on where you sit. The report you co-authored is titled A Coming Crisis in Teaching? Do you think the question mark is really needed?\n\nIf you're sitting in Utah or Arizona, there's no question mark \u2014 you have a crisis in teaching. If you're in better-paying Massachusetts, where there's something of a surplus in some fields, you feel a little less concerned about it. The other aspect of the question mark is about the future. We do certainly have a shortfall of teachers right now, and it looks like it will get much worse. But if we change our policies, we could solve the shortage. The question mark is really a question to us about the policies we'll put in place to address these emerging problems.\n\nHigh-poverty schools have some of the biggest teacher attrition and shortage challenges. Your report notes that about half of all schools and 90 percent of high-poverty schools are struggling to find enough qualified special education teachers. These shortages are having the biggest impact on the most vulnerable students, aren't they?\n\nThey are. In some places, we see from the data that 1 in 5 teachers in high-minority schools and high-poverty schools is unprepared for teaching. When you think about how dependent on school children are in these communities and what it means for the quality of education they'll receive, it's particularly alarming.\n\nLet's talk solutions. You write that teacher attrition and turnover are key factors that have to be addressed if states are going to get out of this crisis. Districts need to focus on retention as much as recruitment. Explain that.\n\nWe have a very high attrition rate in the United States: 8 percent of teachers leave every year. That's a couple-hundred-thousand teachers. Less than a third of them are leaving for retirement. If you look at high-performing countries like Finland or Singapore, or go across the border to Ontario, Canada, the attrition rate is usually 3 percent or 4 percent of teachers. If we could reduce our attrition in half to 4 percent \u2014 we call it the 4 percent solution \u2014 we would actually have no teacher shortages right now. We would have plenty of supply and be able to be much more selective about who we bring into teaching. So it is a big part of the problem and the solution.\n\nI found it troubling that most of the attrition is pre-retirement quitting, a kind of, \"I'm out of here.\" It's not the normal retirement trends of teachers ageing out.\n\nThat's exactly right. We actually have a teaching situation right now that is probably as bad as it's been for many, many decades. Teacher salaries have been declining since the 1990s. Teachers are earning about 20 percent less than other college graduates who are similarly educated. Even after you adjust for the difference in the calendar work here, in 30 states a teacher who has a family of four is eligible for several sources of government assistance, including free or reduced-price lunch for their own children in school.\n\nTeacher working conditions are worse than they've been. Most states that cut their budgets because of the recession have not even returned to pre-recession levels of spending, which means books and supplies and materials and computers are in short supply. Class sizes are larger than they used to be. Then we have more and more children in poverty, more and more children who are homeless, so in highly impacted communities, the needs that teachers have to be responsive to on behalf of the children are also very, very taxing.\n\nTo implement the 4 percent solution, focus on pay and working conditions equally? Or one more than the other?\n\nWell, you know, the people who go into teaching tend not to go in it for the money per se. They generally want to do good work on behalf of children, but you do have to get salaries in the lowest-spending states up to something that's at least reasonable to support a middle-class existence. There are high-spending states, mostly in New England and a few other places where salaries are reasonable, but other states do have to worry about it. Working conditions, however, are even more important for keeping people in once they've made the choice to teach. They both matter, but I would say that working conditions are equally important.\n\nPreparation and mentoring matter a lot. Teachers who are well-prepared leave at more than two times lower rates than teachers who are not fully prepared. One of the things we often do in shortages is bring in people who haven't prepared to teach. Then we exacerbate the problem because they leave at two to three times the rate. The same thing is true with mentoring. If we could prepare teachers well, mentor them when they come in and give them decent working conditions, we would be very close to the 4 percent solution.\n\nSpeaking of teacher preparation programs, President Obama's long- promised overhaul of teacher-prep programs never got off the ground. This report seems to underscore the absolute importance of revisiting that stalled reform effort, no?\n\nAbsolutely. We need to make some investments in teacher preparation. Obama made a promise when he ran in 2008. He said, \"If you will teach, we will pay for your education.\" That didn't happen, but if we were to reboot that promise and actually ensure that people who choose this noble profession do not come into it with college debt, that would also make a huge difference in the conditions of teaching and supply.\n\nThe reports make clear that minority teachers have some of the highest attrition rates. What can be done to keep minority teachers in the classroom longer? They write that one of their biggest problems is lack of autonomy in the classroom, lack of input in decision-making. That seems to get down to management, right?\n\nYes. A lot of these problems do get down to management. If you look at the reasons that minority teachers leave, the first reason is lack of administrative support. The second one is concerns about the way accountability pressures in the No Child Left Behind era created pressure to teach to the test, lots of sanctions and the loss of autonomy in the classroom because quite often in central-city schools, where minority teachers are concentrated, they were moved to a scripted, teacher-proof curriculum, geared to test preparation, which is not what people go into teaching for.\n\nThey go into teaching to engage students, to excite them about learning, to create exciting classrooms. I think there's both the support that teachers need to be enabled to teach, which administrators are a key part of providing, along with the investments in their teaching conditions. Then there's the opportunity to teach freely and creatively in ways that are exciting and work for children.\n\nWhat are some concrete ways in which school districts can work on working conditions to make teachers stick around longer?\n\nOf course teachers need materials that are necessary to teach. You know, the books and computers and that kind of thing. So clearly that's a first level of need. But beyond that, teachers always talk about how they want to be able to collaborate with their colleagues. They want to be in a collegial environment. They want to be clear that they're supported in their efforts. That there's moral support and the opportunity to continue to learn and be more effective, which is how teachers get their satisfaction \u2014 by meeting the needs of students in ways that allow them to see that learning.\n\nThat really means we need great principals. We need principals who know how to create learning environments for teachers as well as kids that are collegial and focused on everyone pulling together in a common direction. We do very little in this country to prepare principals.\n\nTalk a little bit more about that. Should more be done to strengthen principal training or support, and what might that look like?\n\nWe do need to do more to support principal training and recruitment. We want to recruit into these jobs the very best teachers who are dynamic leaders as well and then help them learn the management skills that they need to succeed. There are some places that have done good work in this regard. North Carolina has a Principal Fellows Program that allows the recruitment of dynamic people and then underwrites their training. They get to train under the wing of an expert principal in an internship while they're also taking course work. That's produced a lot of great leadership in that state.\n\nWe need a real coherent approach, both in the states and with federal support, to be sure that our schools are well-led. I'd love to see us get a sort of a West Point for leadership in education the way we have the training for leaders in the military, who get the best access to state-of-the-art opportunities to learn these very difficult skills. That would make a huge difference in the quality of our schools, particularly in the highest-need communities.\n\nI like that. I might borrow this from you, if you don't mind.\n\nIt's interesting, as a reporter, the most interesting, innovative and, I think, most successful classrooms I've visited are places where teachers feel they have a good measure of autonomy, are supported, and the schools invest in professional development. Your thoughts? \n\n\n\nThat is the special sauce right there. Teachers want to work together and collaborate, but then they have to adapt whatever they figure out to their needs of their own classroom. They want to be creative, and they need that opportunity to continue to learn and be supported by the leadership in the school. That's what makes people who want to produce learning happy. They are learners themselves. That's why people go into the profession. If you can get that secret sauce, you've got a lot of the juice you need for that 4 percent solution."}, "https://www.change.org/p/tds-of-the-32nd-d%C3%A1il-i-support-aaa-pbp-bill-to-repeal-the-8th-lift-constitutional-ban-on-abortion-in-ireland": {"title": "Sign the Petition", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.change.org/p/tds-of-the-32nd-d%C3%A1il-i-support-aaa-pbp-bill-to-repeal-the-8th-lift-constitutional-ban-on-abortion-in-ireland", "text": "In October 2016 the AAA/PBP Bill to repeal the 8th Amendment from the Irish Constitution will be debated in the D\u00e1il (Parliament).

Among its co-authors are academics from University College London, Cambridge University and Oxford University, three of the top academic institutions not just in Britain but in the world.\n\nThe drily titled \u201cEffects of health and social care spending constraints on mortality in England: a time trend analysis\u201d calculates that there have been 120,000 excess deaths since 2010, when the Conservatives took power via the coalition and started swinging the axe.\n\nThe study says the over-sixties - and in particular care home residents \u2013 have borne the brunt. The critical factors it identifies as leading to so many of them dying needlessly early are cuts to social care spending and a reduction in the number of nurses. It\u2019s worth bearing the latter in mind because Brexit, of course, is squeezing the supply of nurses as EU nationals resident in these islands understandably vote with their feet.\n\nBy 2020 the \u201cmortality gap\u201d \u2013 one of those bland terms that are frequently used to describe brutal truths \u2013 could have hit 200,000, even with the extra funding that has recently been allocated to social care.\n\nEvery day there are 100 needless deaths in England, and they come as a result of government policy. Just think about that figure for a moment. It\u2019s positively chilling. Just writing about it leaves me feeling in need of a valium. I\u2019d imagine that would be true of anyone to whom empathy is not an alien concept.\n\nIf the gap is to be closed, the academics say, \u00a36.3bn a year more is needed.\n\nAnd the response of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Department of Health to that?\n\nIt described the figures as \u201cspeculative\u201d and argued that \u201cfirm conclusions\u201d couldn\u2019t be drawn from the work. That\u2019s like a kid in the schoolyard whose answer to everything is \u201cbut you stink, nyah, nyah\u201d.\n\nNow open up your Twitter feeds, trolls, while the more erudite variety are trotted out by journals such as The Spectator to argue that the study just goes to show how academics are all a bunch of woolly liberals, without making any attempt to address the points they make on the back of the painstakingly constructed research they have conducted.\n\nAttack the messenger because you can\u2019t come up with anything approaching a decent argument to counter the message. There\u2019s a lot of that about at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile the dying goes on. And on, and on. And it isn\u2019t just in care homes where the suffering is brutal. Today sees a vote on the Government\u2019s universal credit, another calculated act of political savagery that will probably squeeze through thanks to the \u00a31bn magic money tree Theresa May found for the Democratic Unionist Party so she could stay in No 10.\n\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that by 2022 low-income families will be worse off through cuts to it, despite the Tories palliatives: tax changes and a higher minimum wage. That\u2019s before we even get to the train wreck of its implementation.\n\nFlat-screen TVs? As inflation continues to bite as a result of the Brexit driven fall in the pound, Britain\u2019s poor are increasingly struggling simply to afford food. It\u2019s why the food banks that the execrable Jacob Rees-Mogg described as \u201crather uplifting\u201d won\u2019t be short of business anytime soon.\n\nThe hard Brexit fanboy advocates slashing taxes, which would mean still more cuts to social care and social support, and thus more dead bodies. A genuine question for you, Mr Rees-Mogg: you advocate pride in Britain? Please could you tell me why I should feel proud of being part of a country whose Government is complicit in 120,000 needless deaths and counting?\n\nI doubt I\u2019ll get an answer from the pumped up latter-day Lord Brideshead, whom a lot of people think should be the next prime minister, and whose wing of the party wants to burn the welfare state and turn Britain into a foggy Singapore, regardless of how many people die in the process. They\u2019re little people, after all, and who cares about them?\n\nTurns out there might just be enough people in these isles who do care to make life difficult for his party.\n\nRobert Halfon, the former skills minister, recognised this when he said that the Conservatives were on \u201cdeath row\u201d in the wake of the last general election and would remain there unless they could offer a \u201cpositive vision\u201d that contrasted with their perception as the party of austerity. He (laughably) suggested they try a rebranding exercise to create the Conservative Workers Party.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take more than a rebrand. There are real people on death row thanks to Conservative policies, and their numbers are growing. It is time we took Mr Halfon at his word and substituted his benighted party for them."}, "https://eoinhiggins.com/this-is-fucking-bullshit-8c942f32c9ef#.yqrlq88mw": {"title": "\u201cThis is Fucking Bullshit.\u201d \u2013", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://eoinhiggins.com/this-is-fucking-bullshit-8c942f32c9ef#.yqrlq88mw", "text": "An American man fighting with the YPG in Syria is seeing his story hit the big screen\u2014 but he wasn\u2019t asked for his approval before the film\u2019s production was announced.\n\n\u201cRasid Fuad,\u201d or @PissPigGranddad, has been fighting with the Kurdish communist forces since last fall.

The stock prices of the two biggest private prison builders -- CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America) and GEO Group -- doubled after Trump took office.\n\nCompanies that charge for expensive phone calls from prisons and jails also won big after Trump's victory. One of the president's first appointments placed Ajit Pai at the helm of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), who promptly rolled back the agency's 2015 decision to regulate the prison phone industry. The companies hailed it as a victory.\n\nShortly after the FCC's reversal, Securus, one of the largest prison phone companies, announced it was being sold to Platinum Equity, a large investment firm for a reported $1.5 billion. (To date the deal has not been finalized.) Tom Gores, Platinum's founder and CEO, is an investment mogul who also owns the Detroit Pistons. In 2011, Gores purchased the basketball team with the stated intent of improving the struggling city.\n\nIn the United States' current economy, prisons and basketball are growth industries. Both profit from the exploitation of Black bodies, pulling in people from poor neighborhoods in major cities like Detroit. Yusef Shakur grew up on these streets. He ran in a gang at a young age and spent nine years incarcerated. He is an activist today working in Detroit's Black community. In an interview with Truthout, he called Gores's purchase of Securus another \"capitalist adventure\" taking advantage of the \"most marginalized and most oppressed.\"\n\nSecurus has seen steady economic growth in recent years, trading hands between several large hedge funds. In 2011, Securus was purchased by the investment firm Castle Harlan for an estimated $440 million. Two years later, the company was bought out by another big investor, Abry Partners, which reportedly paid $640 million. In leaked documents, Securus boasted of making $114 million in profit in 2014, a 30 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nSecurus is a modern day carceral conglomerate, a company that is traded by big investment firms and owns a diversity of prison products and services. It is the second largest prison phone company, behind Global Tel Link (GTL), although Securus is quickly moving into various new markets. As Securus describes itself in a recent press release, it is \"a leading provider of civil and criminal justice technology solutions for public safety, investigation, corrections and monitoring.\"\n\nThe company is responsible for phone calls for more than one million people incarcerated in the US, but this is not all. Securus is now installing Skype-style video calling systems that can cost $20-$40 per session. Securus has also acquired two companies in the growing market of electronic monitors.\n\nIn 2015, Securus bought out JPay, an automated billing company that charges families to send money to their loved ones who are incarcerated. Securus, and its parent company Abry Partners, paid $250 million for JPay, a fast-growing business that operates in 33 states and has 1.6 million customers.\n\nThe prison phone industry has come under intense public scrutiny after a 20-year campaign waged by families of those incarcerated, sympathetic attorneys and prison activists. Retired nurse Martha Wright first filed a lawsuit to cap phone rates, which in 2001 was referred to the FCC. Commissioner Mignon Clyburn championed the issue in front of the communications board. In October 2015, the FCC passed sweeping regulations of these calls.\n\nHowever, shortly after coming into office, Trump promoted Commissioner Ajit Pai to serve as chairman. Just days into the position, Pai came out with news the FCC would no longer defend its 2015 decision. In June, a US Court of Appeals in Washington DC ruled 2-1 to strike down the FCC's ruling.\n\nTruthout spoke with Lee Petro, one of the attorneys representing the Wright petitioners, who cited Pai's role in undoing the regulations.\n\n\"The decision by Chairman Pai to prohibit his attorneys to defend the Commission's authority to regulate intrastate rates was a devastating blow, and was directly cited in the majority decision as a basis for overturning the FCC rules,\" Petro said.\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois) introduced a bill that would regulate video calling systems and authorize the FCC to rule on prison phones. Organizing behind this legislation may be the next step for those in the prison phone justice campaign.\n\nDuring Pai's confirmation process, he revealed in a questionnaire that, during 2011 and 2012, Securus was one of his clients when he was working as an attorney at the law firm of Jenner & Block. His confirmation by a Senate committee is still pending.\n\nNot long after Pai's appointment, Securus announced that it was up for sale to Platinum Equity. Its reported $1.5 billion price tag is more than double what was paid for Securus five years ago. Prisons promise to be profitable in the Trump era.\n\nIn 2011, the Detroit Pistons were a struggling basketball team that had a losing record. By that time, Detroit had a reputation as one of the most economically depressed urban centers in the US. Not long after, the city declared bankruptcy. When Platinum's Tom Gores bought the Pistons, it was a risky venture. Gores purchased the team for $325 million, a bargain price that one commentator called \"shocking.\" The same year, Platinum was listed as the 23rd largest private company by Forbes. Today, Gores is worth an estimated $3.3 billion.\n\nGores was raised in Genesee, Michigan, a suburb of Flint, not far from Detroit. He moved to California where he established Platinum Equity in 1995, with headquarters in Beverly Hills. Platinum has bought and sold more than 185 different companies in a variety of industries including information technology, manufacturing and transportation. It owns the largest newspaper in San Diego, the Union-Tribune. A global company, Platinum also has offices in offices in New York, Boston, London, and Singapore.\n\nGrowing up near Detroit, Gores professed his desire to use the Pistons to help turn the city around.\n\n\"If all I do is make a few bucks,\" Gores wrote in Forbes, \"that's not good.\" A winning team would bring people back to Detroit, he said, \"so we have to figure out how to win, how to compete. I know the city needs that.\"\n\nAlso known for his philanthropy, Gores pledged to raise $10 million for residents of Flint after news broke of their toxic water supply.\n\nHowever, activists who spoke to Truthout questioned Gores's good intentions. Ronald Simpson-Bey, is an alumni associate at Just Leadership USA who currently lives in Detroit. He did 27 years in Michigan state prisons before having his conviction overturned in 2012. Platinum's purchase of Securus \"speaks volumes,\" he said. \"People like Gores need to invest money in people, not prisons.\"\n\nTruthout attempted to reach Gores, but he did not return a request for comment.\n\nGores recently announced the Pistons are coming back to the city in a move that is being billed as key to building a \"New Detroit.\" For years, the Pistons have played at The Palace in the suburb of Auburn Hills. A new stadium named Little Caesars Arena is expected to open before the end of the year in downtown Detroit and will host games by the Pistons as well as the hockey team, the Detroit Redwings (owned by Christopher IIitch, who made his fortune from the pizza chain and acquired the naming rights to the arena). In an interview with the New York Times about the team's move downtown, Gores described the Pistons as the missing \"family member\" in Detroit.\n\nYet not everyone in Detroit feels they are part of one big happy family. The city's downtown appears to be on a \"comeback,\" said Simpson-Bey, with investment downtown, cultural activities, and a new rail system, \"but just a mile away you see lots of urban decay.\"\n\nDr. David Leonard, author of Playing While White: Privilege and Power On and Off the Field, who writes widely on race and sports, told Truthout that basketball has often been sold as a \"rebirth for communities.\" What is lost in these narratives is how \"basketball franchises, and the league itself, are so often drivers of gentrification. While owners cash in on the benefits of tax breaks and their celebrity status resulting from fandom, many inside these communalities continue to suffer. Stadium construction and gentrification continues to destroy neighborhoods, displacing families and communities that are overwhelmingly of color.\"\n\nThe new Detroit arena was built with the help of $344 million in taxpayer-backed city bonds. A public-private arrangement, it is technically owned by the city, but will be run by Illitch's company.\n\nGentrification and prisons both destabilize poor people. Mass incarceration is a \"driving factor\" behind poverty in Detroit, commented Dr. Amanda Alexander, Assistant Professor of Afro-American Studies and Postdoctoral Fellow in Law at the University of Michigan, and founder of the Prison & Family Justice Project.\n\n\"In buying Securus, Gores and Platinum Equity are profiting off the immiseration of incarcerated people and their families,\" Alexander told Truthout. \"Two in three families have difficulty meeting their basic needs when a loved one is incarcerated, in part because of the high costs of phone calls.\"\n\nDetroit is the poorest major American city, with nearly 60 percent of children living in poverty, she pointed out. A 2016 study called A Shared Sentence, conducted by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, found that one out of ten children in Michigan has a parent in prison. Detroit teachers and social workers who have reached out to Alexander for assistance estimate that half of the children in their classrooms have had a parent or caregiver in jail or prison.\n\nBy building the new stadium, the Pistons and Gores \"claim they want to be part of a thriving Detroit,\" but this move is \"completely against the well-being of families struggling to make ends meet in the city,\" Alexander stated.\n\nAfrican American families are bearing the greatest costs of mass incarceration in Michigan. According to a report by the Prison Policy Initiative, although Black people make up 14 percent of the state population, they are 49 percent of those in prisons and jails. Black residents are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites.\n\nDetroit is also a Black city, with a population that is 80 percent African American. On the court, the Pistons are dominated by Black players. The Pistons' roster for the 2017-18 season includes 15 players, 10 of whom are African American.\n\nIn the New Detroit, Gores has found a way to make a profit from Black bodies both on the court and in prison. This is an investment strategy that monetizes successful athletes, as well as those who fail to assume their place in the postindustrial economy. It is reinforced by a powerful ideological message.\n\n\"We collectively celebrate Jordan, Kobe, and LeBron, purportedly proving that we are beyond race and racism,\" Leonard said. \"At the same, we spotlight their successes, their fulfillment of the American Dream, we suggest that those locked behind bars are there because of bad choices.\"\n\nSpeaking from first hand experience, Ronald Simpson-Bey described phone calls as an \"umbilical cord\" between those in prison and their families. Yet companies like Securus are \"exploiting\" the downfall of others. \"The people who can least afford it are being charged the most,\" he said.\n\nYusef Shakur also testified to the importance of phone calls, saying they were a \"lifeline\" for those inside. Many people affected by mass incarceration, \"inside and out,\" Shakur noted, are functionally illiterate, making letter writing uncommon. Visiting prisons often located in rural areas is difficult. \"Phones are the most realistic option,\" he said.\n\nFamilies can rack up hefty monthly bills paying for regular phone communication with a loved one locked up. Securus has the contract for Wayne County, where Detroit is located, and a 15 minute call from the county jail costs $7.50. In nearby Flint, where Securus is also the provider, a 15 minute call costs $17, one of the highest rates in the country.\n\nTo date, no local newspapers have picked up the story of Gores's purchase of Securus.\n\n\"They are all in cahoots,\" said Simpson-Bey. \"Newspapers are not going to make a peep about it.\"\n\nThe redevelopment of the city also involves plans for a new county jail, which has been contested by grassroots organizations.\n\n\"Look at what's being built in New Detroit. What about the criminals?\" questioned Yusef Shakur. \"They are going to need somewhere to throw them away. That is what's fueling the new county jail.\"\n\nRace, class, and economics are tied together in Detroit, according to Shakur.\n\n\"It is a monopoly for the benefit of the wealthy,\" he said."}, "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-school-shooting-suspect-nikolas-cruz-white-nationalist-republic-of-florida/": {"title": "White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member", "keywords": ["jordan jereb", " nikolas cruz", " republic of florida", " white nationalist", " Anti-Defamation League", " deadly shooting", " Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School"], "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-school-shooting-suspect-nikolas-cruz-white-nationalist-republic-of-florida/", "text": "PARKLAND, Fla. -- The leader of a white nationalist militia Thursday night appeared to walk back his earlier statements that Florida shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz was a member of his group.

Many of us watched 9/11, and accepted the government and media\u2019s definition of the attack as a act of war rather than a criminal action. A smaller portion, drifting along passively thought a major war was coming, that people we knew were going to fight and die. Some of us maybe worried about our younger brother being drafted, despite being in college. Now, it seems stupid, but in the 72 hours after 9/11, some Americans, maybe suffering from depression, certainly with a mind shaped by comic books and action movies, ate up the \u201cus vs. them\u201d good vs. evil rhetoric spouted by the cowboy in chief. After all, he was the president, and no matter how bright you might think yourself, you can still be swayed by passion and emotion, led to terrible decisions.\n\nSome of us, therefore, left our dorm rooms, and walked down Main Street to the recruiter\u2019s office. Some of us were genuinely surprised the office wasn\u2019t full to bursting of young men eager to avenge their fallen countrymen. Some of us were genuinely surprised when we had to push the recruiter to stop trying to sell desk jobs and just let us join the damn Infantry.\n\nSome of us got enlisted, then, and went down to Georgia, head high to mask the anxiety and fear they might have helped. Perhaps some number of Americans in this situation discovered that maybe it hadn\u2019t been the best idea, but would be goddamned if they were going to admit it, and let everyone back home smuggly remark on how right they were.\n\nSo they persevere. They learn to work as a unit, to look past personality issues, to see each other as Soldiers rather than as a race, or economic status, or any of the other things people hate about each other.\n\nThen some of these people, perhaps while sitting hungover in the platoon area in the Republic of Korea hear that we have invaded Iraq. They have \u201cBig Scary Bombs\u201d, and Saddam Hussein, the secular Arab dictator had somehow colluded with the devoutly religious OBL to attack the US. They hated our freedom, you see.\n\nThen some of these young American men might transfer back to Georgia and be assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division, and end up in Iraq in January of 2005. And maybe these kids, still drunk on Fox News and fantasies of glory and renown being enough to win their ex-girlfriends back, are excited to go to Iraq. Sure, we hadn\u2019t found any WMDs yet, and we had Hussein in custody, but they were still somehow a threat and had to be dragged kicking and screaming into Jeffersonian democracy. Inside every dirka is a good American, yearning to be free.\n\nSo you fight. You kill. Watch friends die. Its usually quick, almost never quiet, but for the rest of your life, when you remember sitting at the bar with them, they\u2019re blown open. You picture the nights you spent downtown at Scruffy Murphy\u2019s, but instead of the stupid hookah shell necklace, your boy\u2019s jaw is blown off, and his left eye is ruined, and he\u2019s screaming.\n\nYou fight, you kill, you watch friends die, and you notice a distinct lack of change. You kick in doors and tell terrified women to sit on the floor while you and your friends ransack their home, tearing the place apart, because they might be hiding weapons. There is no reason to believe this house in particular is enemy, same for the next one, and the one after that, or the seven before; they just happened to be there, and maybe they had weapons. Probably not, they almost never did. There were a few times when we had deliberate raids based on solid intel and we\u2019d turn up some stuff, but generally we were just tossing houses because we could.\n\nThen maybe your FISTer forgets to carry the remainder, and drops a mess of mortars on the village your supposed to protect. Maybe the big Iraqi running at you screaming was just mentally ill. Of course, you won\u2019t know this until after you\u2019ve but seven rounds through his ribcage, and his wailing, ancient mother is cradling his body, spitting at you.\n\nMaybe when you get back to the FOB, the Platoon Sergeant tells you you did the right thing; next time, it might be a suicide bomber.

(Photo: Eric Thayer / The New York Times)\n\nThe fact that Trump, Bannon and the rest of their coterie do not think through the implications of their acts is not unusual. One marked peculiarity of politics in capitalist systems is how those systems train politicians. Corporations and the rich provide the funds that enable election victories. They expect specific favors in return: a government order, a tariff, crisis bailouts, or a foreign intervention, for example. Politicians in office must deliver those, or risk removal. Politicians must also veneer those deliveries with verbiage about the national interest, the people's safety, job creation and other vague yet vital-sounding priorities. The act of thinking through their actions' implications -- let alone publicly explaining such complexities -- exceeds the capacity and need of many political leaders. They usually do the favors (or, at least, most of them) while allaying popular concerns with public posturing. If and when that fails, they repress those concerns.\n\nIt is impossible to identify, measure and trace the influences on every political decision. Politicians hope that their positions are strengthened, or at least not too badly damaged, by whatever consequences are attributed to their actions. No matter how confident they are in predicting these consequences, politicians generally focus on preparing either to plausibly dispute any negative consequences or deflect responsibility.\n\nTaking a different tack, we might ask what must happen for Trump and Bannon's actions to yield the outcomes they claim to hope for. Our answers will suggest some sense of where this theatrical new administration will likely push us.\n\nFor example, how might the promised \"middle class\" jobs and incomes become available to the millions who lost or lack them? Trump's plan is to stimulate demand for labor power, supposedly via major infrastructure spending and relocating workplaces back into the United States, while limiting the supply of labor power, via deporting and banning the entrance of millions. If all that happens -- a big if -- it will be necessary to prevent a surge in automation as the employer response to rising wages. It will also be necessary to prevent or offset retaliatory measures by foreign countries. They might, for example, place tariffs on incoming US exports or tax or discriminate against US holdings inside their borders. It will be necessary to prevent or offset a business cycle downturn. Nor does this list exhaust the many other conditions needed to enable Trump to deliver on his promise.\n\nIs it possible for enough of such necessary events to occur to deliver what Trump and Bannon promise? Such wished-for outcomes are always possible, but are they likely? To be sure, other events could happen and provide substitute supports for US capitalism. An economic resurgence could materialize from the crash of 2008 and the subsequent paltry \"recovery\" that has bypassed so many. If that happened, Trump and Bannon no doubt would claim that it was the result of their policies.\n\nIn capitalism, politicians' perpetual anxieties flow, in part, from their general function as scapegoats for the system's bad economic results -- instabilities, inequalities, injustices. They blame each other, and thereby cultivate illusions among the electorate that rotating the major politicians will change the basic economic structures and their effects. More importantly, they reinforce existing taboos against blaming economic ills (such as unemployment, low wages, foreclosed homes and unsustainable debts) on the capitalist economic system that has fired, underpaid and/or evicted so many. To the extent that politicians address economic issues at all, they carefully and methodically avoid systemic critiques. They attack a price, interest rate, tax or fee without exposing or attacking the economic system that reproduces it. Politicians often prefer to find and fasten onto important issues -- less immediately connected to the economic system -- to establish some real differences (e.g., on ecology, abortion, civil liberties, immigration policy, etc.). Mainstream politicians do this because in terms of their orientations toward supporting, protecting and reinforcing capitalism, there is very little difference among them.\n\nFor politicians, acting as scapegoats for capitalism's systemic dysfunction is especially arduous during its recurring crises. At such moments, they are quick to identify others upon whom to offload as much of their scapegoat status as possible. Likely targets include immigrants, foreigners, religious or ethnic minorities, terrorists and so on. Capitalism's politics turn ugly and can become lethal.\n\nWhat if Trump and Bannon's actions are not followed by sufficiently rising jobs and incomes? What if their popular base begins to turn against them and heed their detractors? What will Trump and Bannon do? To accept defeat and abandon their project is less likely than to ratchet up the scapegoating: more deportations, more refugee bans, more deregulation, more foreigner-bashing, more saber-rattling and risks of war. And with that comes more demonization and repression of those who will likewise ratchet up their questioning or disapproval.\n\nThe particular history of US opposition to German, Italian and Japanese fascisms in the 20th century muddies fascism's prospects here in the 21st. Trump and Bannon avoid overt fascism at this stage. Fascism will more likely come later, reluctantly \"necessitated\" by obstacles they denounce as illegitimately raised against their program. Endless reassurances that fascism is not happening would probably accompany a kind of backing into it.\n\n\"Resistance\" has quickly become the watchword of an impressive opposition to the Trump-Bannon government and its fascist potential. However, the lessons of capitalism's dysfunctional politics will have gone unlearned if opposition remains at the level of resisting this particular administration. Exchanging the Trump-Bannon regime for a return to \"normal\" capitalism returns us to precisely the system that produced Trump and Bannon. An adequate politics now requires that political parties endorsing capitalism be supplemented and challenged by those that do not. We need a political debate and contest between those who think capitalism is the best that human society can achieve and those who think we can do better. The continuing, one-sided politics of the Cold War, in which criticism of capitalism has been equated with treason, could then be overcome. We could finally welcome a more balanced contestation among political movements -- one that includes genuinely different views on capitalism as a system. We could open our minds to the system's problems, and start to create alternatives.\n\nThe ascendance of Trump and Bannon shows why we can and must do better than capitalism."}, "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/06/ferrari-and-maserati-garage-cleaners-strike-for-living-wage?CMP=fb_gu": {"title": "Ferrari showroom cleaners strike for living wage: 'They want us out'", "keywords": ["Living wage", "Minimum wage", "UK news", "Society", "London", "Business"], "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/06/ferrari-and-maserati-garage-cleaners-strike-for-living-wage?CMP=fb_gu", "text": "Best friends Freddy Lopez and Angelica Valencia Bolanos have spent six evenings a week for the past five years polishing the white tiled floors of the Ferrari and Maserati showrooms in the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea \u2013 London\u2019s richest district. \n\n\n\nAlthough the work is arduous and has left them struggling with health problems, they enjoyed their jobs and went home each night proud of the sparkling showroom. But when they turned up for work last Thursday they were told to hand over their showroom keys and were suspended without pay.\n\nThe showroom is owned by HR Owen, Britain\u2019s biggest luxury car dealership. HR Owen staff declined to comment when the Guardian visited the showroom, which displayed six Ferraris including a red \u201cprice on application\u201d La Ferrari 2014 with gull-wing doors and a Ferrari 488 GTB on sale for \u00a3219,000.\n\nA spokesman for HR Owen\u2019s head office said Lopez, who has cleaned the showrooms for seven years, and Valencia Bolanos, who joined him five years ago, are not employees and their services are provided by Templewood Cleaning Services.\n\nThe suspension came two days after they voted to walk out on strike after their employer refused requests for an increase to their \u00a37.50-an-hour minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did not have a single complaint in five years,\u201d Valencia Bolanos, 49, said. \u201cNow, when we join a union, and ask for a fair amount of money \u2013 enough to live in this expensive city \u2013 they want us out.\u201d\n\nValencia Bolanos said they were required to meet very high standards which they continued to do after their hours were reduced from six hours a night to four. \u201cEverything has to be immaculate, there can\u2019t be a mark or even a fingerprint anywhere when they are trying to sell \u00a3200,000 cars,\u201d she said in her native Spanish.\n\n\u201cThey are selling luxury cars for hundreds of thousands of pounds. I\u2019m sure they could afford to pay a living wage if they wanted to, but they don\u2019t even want to look at us,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel very disappointed that after five years of working hard for them this is how they treat us when all we are asking for is the living wage.\u201d\n\nThe living wage, pioneered by Citizens UK, is \u00a39.75-an-hour in London and \u00a38.45 elsewhere in the UK. In spite of 3,000 employers, including Ikea, Lidl, Aldi and many public sector bodies, signing up to the living wage there are still 5.6 million people struggling on less. In London about 680,000 people \u2013 one in 13 of the capital\u2019s population \u2013 earn less than \u00a39.75.\n\nLopez and Valencia Bolanos, who are from Ecuador, were struggling to get by before they were suspended and said they were now forced to beg for help from charity shops.\n\n\u201cEven working two jobs, in order to survive I have to share a bedroom with another man. I am 51-years-old,\u201d said Lopez, with a sigh. \u201cIn all of my years, I have never seen anywhere like London where there is so much wealth surrounded by so much poverty.\u201d\n\nValencia Bolanos lives a few streets away from him in Streatham, south London, where she shares a one-bedroom flat with her teenage son Angel Romero Valencia. Since her income has been cut off, he has started cleaning a bakery from 4am-9am, before turning up for accountancy lectures at Middlesex University.\n\n\u201cHe is considering pulling out of university as he is finding work and study too hard to balance,\u201d said Valencia Bolanos.\n\nValencia Bolanos rode on the 319 bus for an hour each way to the Ferrari showroom on Old Brompton Road, a stone\u2019s throw from The Boltons, the third most expensive street in the UK where the average home costs \u00a319.9m. \u201cExcuse the expression, but it makes me sick to see such wealth when there are so many poor people in this city,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter polishing the floors and cleaning the toilets at the Ferrari showroom, Valencia Bolanos and Lopez walked up the street to the Maserati showroom, which is opposite South Kensington underground station and also owned by HR Owen.\n\nThe company made a gross profit of \u00a348m on sales of \u00a3335m in the year to the end of April 2016, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House.\n\nHR Owen is owned by the Philippine investment firm Berjaya Group. Its biggest shareholder is Vincent Tan, a Malaysian millionaire with a $820m (\u00a3628m) fortune, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nA spokesman for Templewood confirmed that both were employees, adding: \u201cThis is an issue between Templewood and these employees \u2013 it has nothing to do with HR Owen. Freddy and Angelica were suspended for one reason \u2013 claiming payment for hours they had not actually worked, an irrefutable fact; we are now following due process regarding this matter. Contracts between Templewood and its employees fully comply with all employment laws.\n\n\n\n\u201cGiven that United Voices of the World union (UVW), which is representing the couple, has issued a statement that it will immediately initiate legal proceedings against Templewood Cleaning, at an employment tribunal and county court, Templewood is unable to make any further comment.\u201d\n\nThe UVW said Templewood had examined the showroom\u2019s CCTV cameras to find one day when Lopez and Valencia Balanos left work \u201cjust a few minutes early after getting the job down to a first-rate standard\u201d.\n\n\n\nPetros Elia, the union\u2019s general secretary said: \u201cThey work on zero-hours contracts to get the job done,. They have never signed in or signed out so there has been no deception. They leave when the job is complete, often they have stayed late unpaid to finish.\u201d\n\nLopez and Valencia Bolanos, who organised a protest outside the Ferrari showroom last weekend, vowed to continue with their planned strike on Monday. \u201cWe intend to continue to fight this fight until victory,\u201d said Valencia Bolanos.\n\nA Queen\u2019s Counsel barrister at Cloisters chambers has offered to represent the pair pro bono.\n\nThe workers\u2019 plight has also been taken up by some of the regulars at the Duke of Clarence pub opposite the Ferrari showroom. Michael Groves, an 86-year-old chartered surveyor who has lived in the neighbourhood for about 40 years, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an outrage to pay anyone less than \u00a310-an-hour for working here with all this wealth. If they [HR Owen] can sell Ferraris for \u00a3200,000, they can afford to pay their cleaners \u00a310.\u201d"}, "http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764096/its-three-times-cheaper-to-give-housing-to-the-homeless-than-to-keep": {"title": "Giving housing to the homeless is three times cheaper than leaving them on the streets", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764096/its-three-times-cheaper-to-give-housing-to-the-homeless-than-to-keep", "text": "The final week of January saw an annual ritual in government statistical gathering that few people know about \u2014 the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Point-in-Time survey of the homeless population, in which HUD recruits volunteers around the country to go out and try to count up all the homeless people living in America. This year, White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough even joined up, volunteering as part of the San Francisco PIT crew.\n\nCounting the homeless is, of course, a critical element to making appropriate homelessness policy. But good policy also requires greater awareness of a discovery that research continuously confirms \u2014 it's cheaper to fix homelessness by giving homeless people homes to live in than to let the homeless live on the streets and try to deal with the subsequent problems.\n\nThe most recent report along these lines was a May Central Florida Commission on Homelessness study indicating that the region spends $31,000 a year per homeless person on \"the salaries of law-enforcement officers to arrest and transport homeless individuals \u2014 largely for nonviolent offenses such as trespassing, public intoxication or sleeping in parks \u2014 as well as the cost of jail stays, emergency-room visits and hospitalization for medical and psychiatric issues.\"\n\nBetween 2005 and 2012 the rate of homelessness in America declined 17 percent\n\nBy contrast, getting each homeless person a house and a caseworker to supervise their needs would cost about $10,000 per person.\n\nThis particular study looked at the situations in Orange, Seminole, and Osceola Counties in Florida and of course conditions vary from place to place. But as Scott Keyes points out, there are similar studies showing large financial savings in Charlotte and Southeastern Colorado from focusing on simply housing the homeless.\n\nThe general line of thinking behind these programs is one of the happier legacies of the George W Bush administration. His homelessness czar Philip Mangano was a major proponent of a \"housing first\" approach to homelessness. And by and large it's worked. Between 2005 and 2012, the rate of homelessness in America declined 17 percent. Figures released this month from the National Alliance to End Homeless showed another 3.7 percent decline. That's a remarkable amount of progress to make during a period when the overall economic situation has been generally dire.\n\nBut the statistical success of anti-homelessness efforts even in the face of a bad economy underscores the point of the Florida study.\n\nWhen it comes to the chronically homeless, you don't need to fix everything to improve their lives. You don't even really need new public money. What you need to do is target those resources at the core of the problem \u2014 a lack of housing \u2014 and deliver the housing, rather than spending twice as much on sporadic legal and medical interventions. And the striking thing is that despite the success of housing first initiatives, there are still lots of jurisdictions that haven't yet switched to this approach. If Central Florida and other lagging regions get on board, we could take a big bite out of the remaining homelessness problem and free up lots of resources for other public services.\n\nWATCH: 'Obama on why income equality has skyrocketed' (Vox Conversations with the President of the United States)"}, "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-protest-of-national-anthem": {"title": "Colin Kaepernick explains why he sat during national anthem", "keywords": ["Blaine Gabbert", " Colin Kaepernick", " San Francisco 49ers"], "url": "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-protest-of-national-anthem", "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States.\n\nHis latest refusal to stand for the anthem -- he has done this in at least one other preseason game -- came before the 49ers' preseason loss to Green Bay at Levi's Stadium on Friday night.\n\n\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. \"To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\"\n\nThe 49ers issued a statement about Kaepernick's decision: \"The national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.\"\n\nNiners coach Chip Kelly told reporters Saturday that Kaepernick's decision not to stand during the national anthem is \"his right as a citizen\" and said \"it's not my right to tell him not to do something.\"\n\nThe NFL also released a statement, obtained by NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport: \"Players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem.\"\n\nBy taking a stand for civil rights, Kaepernick, 28, joins other athletes, like the NBA's Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony and several WNBA players in using their platform and status to raise awareness to issues affecting minorities in the U.S.\n\nHowever, refusal to support the American flag as a means to take a stand has brought incredible backlash before and likely will in this instance. The NBA's Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf of the Denver Nuggets, formerly Chris Jackson before converting to Islam, refused to acknowledge the flag in protest, citing similar reasons as Kaepernick and saying that it conflicted with some of his Islamic beliefs.\n\nAbdul-Rauf drew the ire of fans and was briefly suspended by the NBA before a compromise was worked out between the league and player, who eventually stood with his teammates and coaches at the playing of the national anthem.\n\nKaepernick said that he is aware of what he is doing and that he knows it will not sit well with a lot of people, including the 49ers. He said that he did not inform the club or anyone affiliated with the team of his intentions to protest the national anthem.\n\n\"This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,\" he said. \"I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. ... If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.\"\n\nKaepernick said that he has thought about going public with his feelings for a while but that \"I felt that I needed to understand the situation better.\"\n\nHe said that he has discussed his feelings with his family and, after months of witnessing some of the civil unrest in the U.S., decided to be more active and involved in rights for black people. Kaepernick, who is biracial, was adopted and raised by white parents and siblings.\n\nThe former Super Bowl starting quarterback's decision to go public comes while he is fighting for his football life with the 49ers, who drafted him in the second round in 2011. He lost his starting job last season after being one of the most promising players in the NFL during his run under former coach Jim Harbaugh.\n\nOver the past few months, his relationship with management has turned sour. He requested a trade last spring, which never came. He also has spent most of the offseason rehabilitating from operations to his left (non-throwing) shoulder, his hand and knee. His recovery left him unable to fully compete with Blaine Gabbert for months and has him seemingly in a bind to regain his starting job.\n\nHe made his preseason debut against the Packers and played in the second quarter, completing two of six passes for 14 yards. He looked as rusty as you'd expect from someone who has not played since last November.\n\nFollowing the game, and without any knowledge of Kaepernick's non-football behavior, coach Chip Kelly said that there has never been any discussion about cutting Kaepernick. Rapoport added Saturday that Kelly will make \"football decisions\" on Kaepernick, despite the quarterback's comments."}, "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_new_slave_revolt_20161009": {"title": "The New Slave Revolt", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_new_slave_revolt_20161009", "text": "A nationwide prison work stoppage and hunger strike, begun on Sept. 9, the 45th anniversary of the Attica uprising, have seen over 20,000 prisoners in about 30 prisons do what we on the outside should do\u2014refuse to cooperate. \u201cWe will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves,\u201d prisoners of the Free Alabama Movement, the Free Ohio Movement and the IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee wrote in a communique.\n\nThis round of prison strikes\u2014there will be more\u2014has had little outside support and press coverage. There have been few protests outside prison walls. Prison authorities\u2014unlike during the 1971 Attica uprising when the press was allowed into the yard to interview the rebellious prisoners\u2014have shut out a compliant media. They have identified strike leaders and placed them in isolation. Whole prisons in states such as Texas were put on lockdown on the eve of the strike. It is hard to know how many prisoners are still on strike, just as it is hard to know how many stopped work or started to fast on Sept. 9.\n\nBefore the strike I was able to speak to prisoner leaders including Melvin Ray, James Pleasant and Robert Earl Council, all of whom led work stoppages in Alabama prisons in January 2014 as part of the Free Alabama Movement, as well as Siddique Hasan, one of five leaders of the April 1993 uprising at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility at Lucasville, Ohio. (The Ohio revolt saw prisoners take control of the facility for 11 days after numerous grievances, including complaints about deaths allegedly caused by beatings from guards, went unanswered.) Now, authorities have cut off the access of these and other prisoner leaders to the press and the rest of the outside world. I have not been able to communicate with the four men since the strike began.\n\nThese prison strike leaders put no hope in a \u201cnational conversation\u201d about race and mass incarceration. They know that corporations, the courts and politicians will never halt the lethal police violence against unarmed men and women of color or dismantle the vast gulags for the poor that dot the country. The mechanisms of repression are by design. They are the logical consequence of deindustrialization. The corporate state uses fear, police violence and huge networks of jails and prisons to keep hundreds of millions of underemployed and unemployed poor people from revolting.\n\n\u201cWe have to shut down the prisons,\u201d Council, known as Kinetik, one of the founders of the Free Alabama Movement, told me by phone from the Holman Correctional Facility in Escambia County, Ala. He has been in prison 21 years, serving a sentence of life without parole. \u201cWe will not work for free anymore. All the work in prisons, from cleaning to cutting grass to working in the kitchen, is done by inmate labor. [Almost no prisoner] in Alabama is paid. Without us the prisons, which are slave empires, cannot function. Prisons, at the same time, charge us a variety of fees, such as for our identification cards or wrist bracelets, and [impose] numerous fines, especially for possession of contraband. They charge us high phone and commissary prices. Prisons each year are taking larger and larger sums of money from the inmates and their families. The state gets from us millions of dollars in free labor and then imposes fees and fines. You have brothers that work in kitchens 12 to 15 hours a day and have done this for years and have never been paid.\u201d\n\nThese strike leaders say that, inside and outside the prison walls, rebellion is the only option.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to call for protests outside of statehouses,\u201d Ray said. \u201cLegislators are owned by corporations. To go up there with the achy-breaky heart is not going to do any good. These politicians are in it for the money. If you are fighting mass incarceration, the people who are incarcerated are not in the statehouse. They are not in the parks. They are in the prisons. If you are going to fight for the people in prison, join them at the prison. The kryptonite to fight the prison system, which is a $500 billion enterprise, is the work strike. And we need people to come to the prisons to let guys on the inside know they have outside support to shut the prison down. Once we take our labor back, prisons will again become places for correction and rehabilitation rather than centers of corporate profit.\u201d\n\nThese striking prisoners are far more effective, and far more threatening to the corporate state, than the outside multitudes entranced and manipulated by the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Goon Show. Denied the right to employment, to vote and to public assistance because of felony convictions, denied the right to justice because they are poor, and denied a voice because they have been silenced by state censorship and a bankrupt media, these prisoners were some of the first to understand the totalitarian nature of the corporate state.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe in the political process,\u201d said Ray, who spoke from the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, Ala., and who is serving life without parole. \u201cWe are not looking to politicians to submit reform bills. We aren\u2019t giving more money to lawyers. We don\u2019t believe in the courts. We will rely only on protests inside and outside of prisons and on targeting the corporations that exploit prison labor and finance the school-to-prison pipeline.\u201dThe 2.3 million human beings, most of them poor people of color, who are locked in cages across the country provide billions in salaries and other revenues for depressed rural towns with large prisons. They provide billions more in profits to phone card companies, money transfer companies, food service companies, merchandise vendors, construction companies, laundry services, uniform companies, prison equipment vendors and the manufacturers of pepper spray, body armor and the many other medieval instruments used for the physical restraint of prisoners. They also make billions for corporations\u2014Whole Foods, Verizon, Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, Sprint, Victoria\u2019s Secret, American Airlines, J.C. Penney, Sears, Wal-Mart, Kmart, Eddie Bauer, Wendy\u2019s, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Fruit of the Loom, Motorola, Caterpillar and dozens of others\u2014that collectively exploit 1 million prison laborers.\n\nWhy pay workers outside the walls the minimum wage when you can pay workers behind walls only a couple of dollars a day? Why exploit sweatshop workers in countries like Bangladesh when you can exploit sweatshop workers in U.S. prisons? Why permit prison reform that would impede profits? Why not expand a system that reduces labor costs to slave wages?\n\n\u201cThe beauty of a work stoppage is that the prison administrators have to bring in compensated labor,\u201d Hasan told me last year when I visited him on death row in Ohio. \u201cThis is what happened in the Georgia prison system in 2010 when the prisoners held a work stoppage for six days. It cost the state a lot of money.\u201d\n\nPrisoners are the ideal workers in corporate America. They earn from 8 cents to about 44 cents an hour. In some states, such as Alabama, they earn nothing. They receive no Social Security, pensions or other benefits. They do not get paid overtime. They are prohibited from organizing or carrying out strikes. They always show up on time. They are not paid for sick days or granted vacations. They cannot complain about poor working conditions or safety hazards. If they protest their meager wages or working conditions they instantly lose their jobs and are placed in isolation cells. They live in an environment where they daily face the possibility of torture, beatings, prolonged isolation, sensory deprivation, racial profiling, rancid food, inadequate medical care, little or no heating and ventilation, and rape. I\n\nThe bondage that prisoners endure is, little by little, being imposed on us. The fight inside prison walls is our own. And the harsh repression inside prisons to halt the new strike mirrors the harsh repression that awaits us if we resist.\n\nKevin \u201cRashid\u201d Johnson, the minister of defense of the New Afrikan Black Panther Party (Prison Chapter), sent this message out of his Texas prison a few days ago:\n\nMonday, September 5, 2016: Labor Day. Here at the William P. Clements Unit, a prison in remote Amarillo, Texas, the prisoners awoke to a late breakfast. A single PBJ sandwich, a small bowl of dry cereal, and no beverage. This grossly inadequate meal, which is our common fare during institution-wide lockdowns, signaled that a weeks\u2014or months\u2014long lockdown was in effect. Hunger pangs set in almost immediately. Such lockdowns are routinely imposed twice yearly so guards can conduct a prison-wide search of each prisoner\u2019s living area and property. But this was not a routine lockdown. For one, those lockdowns almost never occur during holidays (however minor). If a holiday is set to fall during the period of a scheduled lockdown, the lockdown is postponed until the day after the holiday. Secondly, those lockdowns happen exactly six months apart, almost to the day. The next one wasn\u2019t due until mid-October, making this lockdown over a month ahead of schedule. Thirdly, for a couple months preceding this lockdown, officials had been rejecting a lot of mail and media on grounds that it contained information on or \u201cadvocating\u201d \u201cprison strikes,\u201d \u201cprison disruption,\u201d or \u201cwork strikes.\u201d During late August and early September I received a number of these rejections, including for letters from the editor of the San Francisco Bay View newspaper, Comrades from the Houston, TX branch of the Industrial Workers of the World, and others. Officials were also illegally opening and reading privileged legal and media mail outside my presence. They were obviously focused on discovering, scrutinizing, and blocking any information coming into the prison about the work stoppage/strike planned for prisons across the U.S. in protest of prison slave labor and perpetual abuses, which were set to begin on September 9, 2016\u2014the 45th anniversary of the uprising at Attica State Prison, that exposed to the world the inhumanity and savage brutality that Amerika imposes on those it imprisons. And here we find the clue to this untimely lockdown which officials here have been falsely portraying to us as just another routine lockdown. The actual aim of this lockdown was/is to pre-empt the prisoners at this Unit from participating in the September 9th protest by confining everyone to their cells in advance of it, and well into the period during which it might last.\n\nJohnson and other prison strike leaders see through the political theater and illusions that the corporate elites employ to mask Americans\u2019 surrender of freedom. They are not fooled by the clever branding\u2014including the presidency of a black man and possibly the presidency of a woman\u2014used to cover over oppression.\u201cTo say that we have a black president does not say anything,\u201d Melvin Ray said. \u201cThe politicians are the ones who orchestrated this system. They are either directly involved as businessmen\u2014many are already millionaires or billionaires, or they are controlled by millionaires and billionaires. We are not blindsided by titles. We are looking at what is going on behind the scenes. We see a coordinated effort by the Koch brothers, ALEC [the American Legislative Exchange Council] and political action committees that see in prisons a business opportunity. Their goal is to increase [corporate] earnings. And once you look at it like this, it does not matter if we have a black or white president. That is why the policies have not changed. The laws, such as mandatory minimum [sentences], were put in place by big business so they would have access to cheap labor. The anti-terrorism laws were enacted to close the doors on the access to justice so people would be in prison longer. Big business finances campaigns. Big business writes the laws and legislation. And Obama takes money from these people. He is as vested in this system as they are.\u201d\n\nItems once provided to prisoners, such as shoes, extra blankets and toilet paper, now often must be bought from the prison commissary, run by corporations such as Keefe Supply Co. These commissaries are, in effect, company stores where prices are exorbitant and the buyers are hostage. Companies such as GTL force prisoners to pay phone rates five or six times higher than those on the outside. JPay, a money transfer service for prisoners, imposes fees as high as 25 percent. The incarcerated are increasingly being charged for electricity and room and board. This bleeds the prisoners and their families of the little income they possess. Those who run out of money are forced to take out prison loans to buy medications, cover legal and medical fees and purchase commissary items such as soap and deodorant. Debt peonage is as common among prisoners as it is among the wider public. And when prisoners are released they often owe the state thousands of dollars in debt they incurred while locked up. When they can\u2019t pay it back they are tossed back into prison. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that 75 percent of released prisoners are rearrested within five years. This keeps the perpetual cycle of neoslavery lubricated.\n\n\u201cFor years we were called niggers to indicate we had no value or worth and that anything could be done to us,\u201d Ray told me. \u201cThen the word \u2018nigger\u2019 became politically incorrect. So they began calling us criminals. When you say a person is a criminal it means that what happens to them does not matter. It means he or she is a nigger. It means they deserve what they get.\u201d"}, "http://www.laweekly.com/music/henry-rollins-white-america-couldnt-handle-what-black-america-deals-with-every-day-7134994": {"title": "Henry Rollins: White America Couldn't Handle What Black America Deals With Every Day", "keywords": ["henry rollins", " dallas shootings", " alton sterling", " Philando Castile", " racism", " washington dc", " two americas", " rudy giuliani"], "url": "http://www.laweekly.com/music/henry-rollins-white-america-couldnt-handle-what-black-america-deals-with-every-day-7134994", "text": "In light of the recent police shootings in Texas and the deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, both killed by members of law enforcement \u2014 just the latest three of the many examples of obscene, needless deaths in America \u2014 one could conclude that all hell has broken loose and things are falling apart. I do not agree.\n\nThings are bad, but I would posit that they have been this way for as far back into American history as you want to go. What has changed is the amount of information available to the average citizen. Thanks to cellphones and people employing social networking to spread news quickly, what goes on minute to minute has crossed the line into overload.\n\nNow that you can watch people die on Facebook, your evaluation of the facts and the sheer amount of information you want to deal with is up to you.

The mainstream media outlets allow this utter crap to slide by unchallenged and, by doing so, legitimize falsehoods that could get people killed. Ratings-based, 24/7, for-profit media is the complete death of true journalism and a catapult for propaganda.\n\nIf white America experienced a fraction of what black America deals with regarding law enforcement, incarceration, the court system, employment and countless other facts of life, they would immediately and collectively lose their minds.\n\nThere are at least two different Americas. They have existed in an environment of almost unbroken mutual exclusivity. That\u2019s over now.\n\nSee also: Henry Rollins: Backroom Bigotry Is Now Out in the Open\n\nIn 1969, when I was about 8 years old, I saw the divide. I went to a school in Washington, D.C., with mostly African-American kids who were bused in from different neighborhoods in the same city. It was a constantly harrowing experience. I got picked on for the color of my skin. Pushed into the urinal, head slammed into the water fountain, shoved down the stairs. It was miserable.\n\nWhen I really started to understand the two Americas was in third grade. On the last day of school, we were all told if we had passed or failed for the year. There were several kids older than me in my class. They had already been held back and were getting older as their education stagnated. When some of these kids were told that they had not passed, the expression on their faces didn\u2019t change.\n\nEarlier that year, in the play area one day, kids had lined up for free bag lunches that were handed out. There were more kids than lunches. One kid put a pencil through the palm of the kid who got the last one. We all stood there and watched as he screamed.\n\nIt was in this year that I understood that my life in America was going to be different, not only because of the color of my skin but because of the advantages that came with it.\n\nI learned another lesson many years later, in 1991. I was on the first Lollapalooza tour. It was one of the best summers of my life. I spent a lot of time hanging out with Ice-T. We talked almost every day. He is one of the most articulate and intelligent people I have ever met. I wish I had a teaspoon of what he\u2019s got. I also spent time with his bandmates and crew.\n\nOn days off, or when our buses would pull into the same place, we would eat together. All his guys wore gold. I have no idea what a necklace is worth, but it all looked expensive to me. When we went into places, white patrons and staff tripped on these guys. This is when I understood one of the reasons for the visible display of wealth. My whiteness assured them that I could pay for my meal. Ice-T and his guys had to demonstrate their ability to pay by literally wearing a show of wealth.\n\nI\u2019m an educated, Caucasian, heterosexual male. Does this ensure I will have success and live the American Dream? Obviously it doesn\u2019t, but it damn sure drops me on second base with a great opportunity to steal third.\n\nI live solidly in one of the Americas but have been aware of other Americas for decades. For the last week, I have heard politicians use a phrase that nauseates me whenever I hear anyone say it. The need to \u201ccome together.\u201d To that I say, \u201cYou first, motherfucker.\u201d\n\nSince an upgrade will not occur on a national level via presidential pen stroke or SCOTUS decision, you have to take it upon yourself to be an infinitely fantastic person every single day. There will be times when it will be a bitch to be so awesome, but you\u2019ll handle it. This century will be about incredible individuals. Bold acts of kindness and a genuine desire to at least try to see things from someone else\u2019s perspective are but two of the mandatory requirements for betterment moving forward.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for your government. It\u2019s a broken machine that can only deliver damaged goods. Prejudice coats the mechanics of the USA\u2019s OS. Attempts to clean the parts are attacked as big-government, special-interest meddling. It\u2019s by no means a Gordian knot, but a total system retool is required. It would be incredibly expensive and time-consuming, and the growing pains would be enormous. Not gonna happen.\n\nEquality, tolerance and decency are not inherently American or human traits. They are values you choose to adopt and use or not. So, be amazing all the time.\n\nLook for your weekly fix from the one and only Henry Rollins right here every Thursday, and come back tomorrow for the playlist for his Sunday KCRW broadcast.\n\nMore from the mind of Henry Rollins:\n\nLet's Invade Canada\n\nBend Over, America \u2014 Here Comes President Trump\n\nI Am Basically a Vinyl Cat Lady\n\n"}, "https://bennorton.com/erica-garner-revolutionary-neoliberal-democrats-whitewash/": {"title": "Erica Garner was a revolutionary.

Evo Morales had already called for the establishment of an international climate court, at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009.\n\nNo international tribunal currently has the competency to judge climate crimes. As a result, climate justice is left to individual countries, and legislation varies considerably from one to another.\n\nThe Bolivian text expands on the idea of climate justice and proposes a system for sharing global greenhouse gas emissions. Using the estimate made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that 650 gigatons of CO2 emissions would lead to a temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C by 2050, Bolivia proposed a carbon budget for each country, limiting its right to pollute.\n\nThis carbon budget would apply to both developed and developing countries, and would be based on a climate justice index defined by a country's level of development, its historic responsibility for climate change, its ecological footprint and its technological capacity.\n\nApplying this index would allow the remaining carbon budget to be shared out fairly among developed countries, which are largely responsible for climate change, and developing countries, which are often its first victims.\n\nAccording to Bolivia's calculations, this system would assign 11% of the remaining carbon budget to developed countries and 89% to developing countries.\n\nDeveloped countries currently account for around 20% of the global population. But these countries (including the United States, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, etc.) emit four times more greenhouse gasses per inhabitant than developing countries."}, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/panama-papers-sir-alan-duncan-mp-speaking-in-defence-of-david-cameron-critcised-for-decrying-low-a6979826.html": {"title": "Tory MP says people who aren't rich are 'low achievers'", "keywords": ["Alan Duncan", " David Cameron", " Panama papers", " Conservatives", " UK Politics", " UK", " News"], "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/panama-papers-sir-alan-duncan-mp-speaking-in-defence-of-david-cameron-critcised-for-decrying-low-a6979826.html", "text": "A former Tory minister has sparked a furious backlash by appearing to say people who aren't rich are \"low achievers\".\n\nSir Alan Duncan, the Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, was defending David Cameron in the House of Commons after the Prime Minister addressed criticisms over whether he had benefitted from an offshore fund set up by his late father.\n\nSir Alan said: \"Shouldn't the Prime Minister's critics really just snap out of the synthetic indignation and admit that their real point is that they hate anyone who has got a hint of wealth in them?\n\n\"May I support the Prime Minister in fending off those who are attacking him, particularly in thinking of this place, because if he doesn't, we risk seeing a House of Commons which is stuffed full of low-achievers who hate enterprise, hate people who look after their own family and know absolutely nothing about the outside world.\"\n\nMr Cameron replied: \"I'm very grateful for your support.

Glenn Greenwald and I are finishing dinner at a deserted bistro in Ipanema. The restaurant, which serves its sweating beer bottles in metal buckets and goes heavy on the protein, is almost aggressively unremarkable (English menus on the table, a bossa-nova version of \u201cHey Jude\u201d on the stereo). Greenwald avoids both meat and alcohol but seems to enjoy dining here. \u201cI really believe that if I still lived in New York, the vast majority of my friends would be New York and Washington media people and I would kind of be implicitly co-opted.\u201d He eats a panko-crusted shrimp. \u201cIt just gives me this huge buffer. You\u2019ve seen how I live, right? When I leave my computer, that world disappears.\u201d\n\nGreenwald, now 50, has seemed to live in his own bubble in Rio for years, since well before he published Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks and broke the domestic-spying story in 2013 \u2014 landing himself a Pulitzer Prize, a book deal, and, in time, the backing of a billionaire (that\u2019s Pierre Omidyar) to start a muckraking, shit-stirring media empire (that\u2019s First Look Media, home to the Intercept, though its ambitions have been downgraded over time). But he seems even more on his own since the election, just as the agitated left has regained the momentum it lost in the Obama years.\n\nThe reason is Russia. For the better part of two years, Greenwald has resisted the nagging bipartisan suspicion that Trumpworld is in one way or another compromised by a meddling foreign power. If there\u2019s a conspiracy, he suspects, it\u2019s one against the president; where others see collusion, he sees \u201cMcCarthyism.\u201d Greenwald is predisposed to righteous posturing and contrarian eye-poking \u2014 and reflexively more skeptical of the U.S. intelligence community than of those it tells us to see as \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\nAnd even if claims about Russian meddling are corroborated by Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Greenwald\u2019s not sure it adds up to much \u2014 some hacked emails changing hands, none all that damaging in their content, maybe some malevolent Twitter bots. In his eyes, the Russia-Trump story is a shiny red herring \u2014 one that distracts from the failures, corruption, and malice of the very Establishment so invested in promoting it. And when in January, as \u201cJournalism Twitter\u201d was chastising the president for one outrage or another, Congress quietly passed a bipartisan bill to reauthorize sweeping NSA surveillance, you had to admit Greenwald might have been onto something.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump becomes the starting point and ending point for how we talk about American politics, [we] don\u2019t end up talking about the fundamental ways the American political and economic and cultural system are completely fucked for huge numbers of Americans who voted for Trump for that reason,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about all the ways the Democratic Party is a complete fucking disaster and a corrupt, sleazy sewer, and not an adequate alternative to this far-right movement that\u2019s taking over American politics.\u201d\n\nGreenwald\u2019s been yelling about this, quite heatedly, since before the election. \u201cIn the Democratic Echo Chamber, Inconvenient Truths Are Recast As Putin Plots,\u201d reads the headline of an Intercept piece published in October 2016. \u201cThe Increasingly Unhinged Russia Rhetoric Comes From a Long-Standing U.S. Playbook,\u201d reads another, from February 2017. As Mueller\u2019s investigation widened, no fallen domino \u2014 not the guilty plea of former Trump national-security adviser Michael Flynn, not the indictment of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2014 chastened Greenwald. When it was recently reported that Steve Bannon had lobbed a \u201ctreason\u201d charge in the direction of Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 precipitating his break with the president \u2014 Greenwald rolled his eyes. Bannon\u2019s \u201cmotives are pure & pristine and he is simply trying to inform the public about the truth,\u201d Greenwald tweeted sarcastically.\n\nThis is a year in which even the most anti-Establishment liberals have found themselves rooting for Mueller, a Republican who ran George W. Bush\u2019s war-on-terror FBI. \u201cIt is not an insubstantial portion of Democratic online loyalists who believe that if you deviate from Democratic Party orthodoxy on the Trump-Russia question, you are a paid Kremlin agent,\u201d Greenwald says. And many of those who don\u2019t believe Greenwald works for Vladimir Putin tend to think he does his bidding for free. \u201cI love him,\u201d says former Gawker editor John Cook, who worked with Greenwald at the Intercept. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, tragically wrong on this.\u201d\n\nThanks to this never-ending hot take, Greenwald has been excommunicated from the liberal salons that celebrated him in the Snowden era; anybody who questions the Russia consensus, he says, \u201cbecomes a blasphemer. Becomes a heretic. I think that\u2019s what they see me as.\u201d Greenwald is no longer invited on MSNBC, and he\u2019s portrayed in the Twitter fever swamp as a leading villain of the self-styled Resistance. \u201cI used to be really good friends with Rachel Maddow,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen her devolution from this really interesting, really smart, independent thinker into this utterly scripted, intellectually dishonest, partisan hack.\u201d His view of the liberal online media is equally charitable. \u201cThink about one interesting, creative, like, intellectually novel thing that [Vox\u2019s] Matt Yglesias or Ezra Klein have said in like ten years,\u201d he says. \u201cIn general, they\u2019re just churning out Democratic Party agitprop every single day of the most superficial type.\u201d (Reached for comment, none of these people would respond to Greenwald.)\n\nAll this has led to one of the less-anticipated developments of the Donald Trump presidency: Glenn Greenwald, Fox News darling. For his sins, Greenwald has been embraced by opportunistic #MAGA partisans seeking to discredit the Trump-Russia story. When alt-right ringleader Mike Cernovich sat for a 60 Minutes interview last year, he praised only one journalist: Greenwald. \u201cMy opinion of Glenn ten or 15 years ago was entirely negative,\u201d says Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson, who now heralds him as one of the \u201cclearest thinkers\u201d in media. (A parallel phenomenon involves the rehabilitation by the Resistance of an armada of neoconservative zombies \u2014 David Frum, Max Boot, Robert Kagan, Bill Kristol \u2014 and the lionization, at least temporarily, of Trump-skeptical Republican politicians like John McCain, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham.)\n\nThis, by the way, is the reason we\u2019re eating dinner so late on a Tuesday: Greenwald has to be at a TV studio in a few minutes to be interviewed by Carlson. We leave the restaurant and head across the street to the garage where he parked his Mitsubishi Outlander. Unexpectedly, the gate to the entrance has been shut and the attendant is missing. Mild panic sets in. Greenwald begins rattling the gate. Even if we catch a cab to the studio, his TV clothes are in the car, and he is currently wearing shorts and an old polo shirt. \u201cHow,\u201d he frets, \u201ccan I go on Fox News dressed like this?\u201d\n\nThe parking attendant eventually shows up. There is no traffic; we book it to a high-rise studio with postcard views of Sugarloaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer. Greenwald changes into a shirt and tie but keeps on his shorts and flip-flops. \u201cI\u2019ve never worn long pants when I\u2019m appearing on TV,\u201d he says with a grin. He is miked up and fitted with an earpiece, then forced to wait 20 minutes as his segment keeps getting bumped. The experience of actually listening to Carlson\u2019s show seems to get to him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on a huge anti-gun-control, anti-disarmament rant,\u201d Greenwald tells me the first time I ask him what Carlson\u2019s talking about. \u201cBullshit,\u201d he says the second time I ask, rolling his eyes. By the time he goes live, it is 11:50 p.m., and Carlson asks just two questions.\n\n\u201cSo I only had like three minutes,\u201d he says, un-miking himself. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. It was worth it. It was cathartic.\u201d\n\nGreenwald\u2019s home is located on a dead-end cobblestone street, under a thick canopy of trees, a few miles inland from Ipanema Beach. The grounds are large enough to comfortably accommodate Greenwald; his husband, David Miranda; their two recently adopted children; household staff; 24 formerly stray dogs; and some dog poop, which, when I visit the day before his appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight, I step in.\n\nGreenwald greets me in his cathedral-like living room dressed in his usual shorts and polo. When I joke that he lives in a gated community \u2014 a guard in a booth controls access to the street \u2014 he seems wounded and explains that he could afford the place only because the recent Brazilian recession had devastated Rio\u2019s housing market. He plays coy when I ask him who owned the house previously. \u201cI think it was some hedge-fund pig,\u201d he says.\n\nIn person, Greenwald is funny and unguarded, which is the opposite of his online persona. Within minutes of my arrival, he launches into a story about a possible joint op-ed written with Katie Couric, before relaying a conversation he had with Ta-Nehisi Coates about how problematic it is to collaborate with people like Katie Couric. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m obnoxiously name-dropping, and I\u2019m not!\u201d he says, catching himself. \u201cBut it was like, \u2018How do you maintain your authenticity and the original kind of passion about the world that led you to be someone worth listening to, when now, suddenly, all these doors that had been previously closed are swinging open for you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nGreenwald grew up near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was closeted in high school and cultivated a rebel iconoclasm to cope. \u201cOne of the strategies you can develop is, I\u2019m never going to be weak,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always gonna be smarter and stronger and more aggressive.\u201d Comparing himself to the titular character in the mockumentary American Vandal, he says he once prompted a schoolwide investigation by spray-painting the walls with \u201cextremely offensive profanities about individual students and teachers.\u201d \u201cHe was always warring with the administration, warring with teachers,\u201d says his friend and former classmate Norman Fleisher. Instead of schoolwork, he devoted himself to the competitive-debate circuit and, in his senior year, to a failed bid for the Lauderdale Lakes City Council. He squeaked into George Washington University, where he majored in philosophy \u2014 Nietzsche \u2014 and again poured all his energy into debate. After that, law school at NYU, then a job at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the most decorated and macho of the city\u2019s white-shoe firms. In 1995, he left Wachtell to start his own litigation practice and carved a niche doing pro bono civil-liberties work, including defending neo-Nazi Matthew Hale.\n\nGreenwald supported the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, but in 2005, when it became clear that the war on terror had produced a massive suspension of civil liberties \u2014 warrantless wiretapping, Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2014 Greenwald abandoned his law practice and devoted himself to calling out the administration on his website, Unclaimed Territory. That year, he broke up with a longtime boyfriend, a psychotherapist. To unwind, he came to Rio alone, where he met the then-19-year-old Miranda. Their relationship did not, at the time, entitle Miranda to a visa \u2014 so Greenwald stayed in Brazil; Miranda is now the first openly gay city councilman in Rio\u2019s history.\n\nEarly on, the mainstream press was docile in its coverage of the war on terror. Greenwald and his allies in the nascent left-wing blogosphere emerged to push back. \u201c \u2018Barbarians at the gate\u2019 was kind of the metaphor,\u201d Greenwald says, and his prosecutorial hatchet jobs on the Bush White House became especially popular, despite (or perhaps because of) his exhausting, didactic prose. When he moved his blog to Salon in 2007, says his former colleague Alex Pareene, \u201ceditors would joke about the incredibly SEO-unfriendly headlines on his blog posts. Like, 3,000 words with the headline \u2018And Another Thought.\u2019 \u201d Twitter, when that was invented, proved irresistible to Greenwald. \u201cI would wake up at like nine in the morning and see somebody saying something stupid on Twitter, and then it would be four in the afternoon, and I haven\u2019t gotten out of bed.\u201d\n\nOnce Obama was elected, the left blogosphere cleaved. \u201cSome people, they revealed they\u2019re mainstream, democratic liberals and defended a mainstream, democratic liberal administration,\u201d says Pareene. \u201cOthers, they stuck to their line of opposition to the use of American power.\u201d Greenwald was clearly in the latter camp, praising Ron Paul\u2019s military isolationism and blasting the various \u201cwar criminals\u201d who still ran D.C. Which meant that, by 2013, Greenwald, now writing for The Guardian, had spent a decade hurling invective at essentially everyone in Washington. To someone like Edward Snowden, those were unimpeachable bona fides. To others with more sympathy for the American Establishment, coordinating the publication of Snowden\u2019s documents was something else. Greenwald hatred was intense not just in the intelligence community but also among would-be allies of transparency in the press; Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times said he\u2019d \u201calmost arrest Glenn Greenwald.\u201d Then\u2013Meet the Press moderator David Gregory asked Greenwald if he should be charged for having \u201caided and abetted\u201d Snowden. Greenwald was not wearing long pants during that interview, either.\n\nGreenwald\u2019s self-conception as an opposition figure, though, was getting more complicated. In 2014, Omidyar, the founder of eBay, poured $250 million into a news organization called First Look Media and handed Greenwald the keys. One of Greenwald\u2019s collaborators on the Snowden story, the documentarian Laura Poitras, made a movie about the experience, Citizenfour, in which Greenwald was something of a second star. In 2015, it won the Oscar for Best Documentary, which Greenwald says he could not enjoy because host Neil Patrick Harris joked that \u201cSnowden couldn\u2019t be here for some treason.\u201d At an after-party that night, a BuzzFeed reporter asked him about it. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m really trying hard not to say anything about it,\u2019 \u201d Greenwald recalls. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018No, but you must have an opinion on it,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Neil Patrick Harris is a fucking moron, and that joke was completely idiotic and offensive.\u2019 \u201d (For the record, Snowden thought it was funny.)\n\nLast September, Greenwald traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to speak at an event held by the Lannan Foundation, an organization that offers prizes and speaking engagements to NPR-friendly types like Roxane Gay and Colson Whitehead. Wearing a light-gray suit and black Hugo Boss boots, Greenwald joked with the crowd for a few minutes before warning them that he wouldn\u2019t be discussing the well-chronicled sins of the Trump administration. \u201cI really don\u2019t think you need me taking up your time talking about that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you do for some reason want that, you can always just go home and turn on MSNBC.\u201d Instead, Greenwald delivered an absorbing reading of the postelection landscape that fell somewhere between a troll job and a comprehensive articulation of his worldview.\n\nThe Trump election \u2014 because it upended countless political norms, because polls failed to predict it \u2014 was a psychologically destabilizing development. \u201cWhen events happen that are so fucking out of the ordinary, people look for unifying events,\u201d Greenwald tells me. \u201cIt becomes like a religion.\u201d But Greenwald didn\u2019t view the election as an aberration that needed to be explained. \u201cEvery time Trump says or does something that is xenophobic, or bigoted, or militaristic, or threatening, people always say, \u2018This is not what America is about,\u2019 \u201d he told the crowd in Sante Fe. \u201cI always react to that by saying, \u2018It\u2019s not?\u2019 \u201d\n\nRather than see Trump as a product of a rotten power structure, as Greenwald does, and the 2016 election as a wild reaction against that power structure, as Greenwald also does, it was easier for most American liberals to frame his victory as an accident. And rather than look within to eradicate the conditions that wrought Trump, it was more comforting to pin his rise on an external foe.\n\nThe Russian scandal proved ideal. \u201cAcross the political aisle, American elites are preoccupied with rejuvenating a Cold War in the name of believing that all of our problems are traceable to the Kremlin,\u201d Greenwald argued. The notion that \u201cPutin is not some fumbling dictator but some kind of an omnipotent mastermind,\u201d he went on, \u201cstems very much from this human desire to believe that when things go wrong, it can\u2019t be our fault.\u201d\n\nPut another way: If you believe the 2016 election was a populist uprising against complacent elites, the Russia preoccupation can seem like an effort to ignore what Trump voters \u2014 and Sanders voters \u2014 were trying to say. Alternatively, if you believe Trump\u2019s victory was a Russia-perpetrated fraud, normalcy is restored simply by removing him from office. Which, conveniently, is what many hope Mueller\u2019s Russia probe will do.\n\nThe week I visit Greenwald in Rio, the news out of the D.C.-Moscow gyre is the indictment of three Trump-campaign aides: Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, and Manafort. Sitting at Greenwald\u2019s dining-room table, as a little dog named Kane molests a bigger dog named Enzo, I make the mistake of suggesting this is a \u201chuge\u201d development. Greenwald is ready for me before I finish my sentence.\n\n\u201cHave they been huge?\u201d he pounces, answering his own question. \u201cI mean, I guess they\u2019ve been huge in the sense that Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager was indicted on multiple felony charges, right? That\u2019s inherently huge, but it\u2019s not particularly huge for the Russia story, because all the charges leveled against Manafort were unrelated to questions of collusion with the Russians.\u201d Fair enough, but Papadopoulos\u2019s arrest was in fact related to the question of collusion. Greenwald waves this away. \u201cThey had all these kind of losers who weren\u2019t even in the Trump campaign,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, these charlatans who were constantly puffing up their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, who come from the shittiest schools and have no significant experience.\u201d He continues: \u201cWhat happened this week, for me, is exactly what I\u2019ve been expecting all along.\u201d\n\nTrue. Last March, Greenwald wrote an Intercept piece that forecast the \u201cindictment of a low-level operative like Carter Page, or the prosecution of someone like Paul Manafort on matters unrelated to hacking.\u201d His point then, as now, is that such developments are far removed from the original impetus of the investigation: whether Trump and Russia worked together to throw the election. \u201cIf you go back to what the Democrats were saying in 2016 and then into 2017, it wasn\u2019t \u2018Paul Manafort is laundering money and hiding taxes and failing to register forms about how he\u2019s a foreign agent,\u2019 \u201d Greenwald says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s true of that entire scumbag lobbyist class in D.C.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to what the investigation was designed to focus on, Greenwald says he\u2019s still waiting for hard evidence that the Trump campaign aided Russian operatives in hacking the Clinton-campaign emails \u2014 or struck some other corrupt bargain. Absent that, he\u2019s not impressed. \u201cSome Russians wanted to help Trump win the election, and certain people connected to the Trump campaign were receptive to receiving that help. Who the fuck cares about that?\u201d\n\nGreenwald\u2019s not wrong to criticize the zealotry of the Russia pile-on. The investigation\u2019s boosters not only seem to ignore America\u2019s own long history of election meddling (\u201cYanks to the Rescue: The Secret Story of How American Advisers Helped Yeltsin Win,\u201d crowed a 1996 Time cover story) but also have elevated a bipartisan class of Russia conspiracists like Louise Mensch and Eric Garland to unfortunate prominence. Which is how, for instance, a deranged 127-tweet rant about \u201cgame theory\u201d became cherished by liberals as a Russiagate decoder ring.\n\nHow did all this happen? In a recent issue of n+1, Cornell Law School professor Aziz Rana called 2016 the \u201clast election of the Cold War.\u201d What he meant was that for half a century, an unassailable Western consensus had prevailed that democracy and global capitalism were better than what the other team was offering. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, the presumptive 2016 favorites, reflected this consensus. Their dismal showings suggested the consensus had been busted, and among the signs that the political spectrum had broadened was the appearance of a new-seeming category of Russia-skeptic firebrands sometimes called the alt-left. Greenwald was one of the loudest voices, but there were others, many so divergent in their views of everything but Russia that it hardly made sense to group them together: the Trump-curious burn-it-all-down types; the \u201cdirtbag left,\u201d led by the irreverent politics podcast Chapo Trap House; anti-Zionist-anti-imperialists like Max Blumenthal; basically all of Russian television network RT\u2019s on-air talent; retired NYU scholar and Nation eminence Stephen F. Cohen.\n\nThese critics note the irony that many who were critical of national-security abuses during the Bush and Obama years have now, in the name of defending the republic, put their faith in opaque intelligence agencies and retired generals. That uncomfortable alliance between liberals and the \u201cdeep state\u201d is the Greenwald-Trumpworld relationship inverted; on Russia, the America Firsters in the White House share more with dovish lefties than with Washington\u2019s centrist power elite. To borrow from the language of Brexit, the ideological split on the Russia question may be more \u201cLeave\u201d versus \u201cRemain\u201d than Republican versus Democrat. In other words, Establishment insiders versus skeptical outsiders.\n\n\u201cFor me, the fundamental question is: How satisfied are you with the prevailing order, with the status quo?\u201d By this, Greenwald does not mean life in the Trump era but the behavior of American elites over the past several generations. \u201cHow benevolent do you regard American power and American institutions?\u201d The answer to that question says a lot about how you rate the Trump threat.\n\nOne afternoon, Greenwald and I drive to a sports club affiliated with Rio\u2019s most popular soccer team, Flamengo. His mischievous and adorable children, Jonathas, 8, and Jo\u00e3o Vitor, 10, are scheduled for a tennis lesson at the club\u2019s clay courts. It occurs to me that a tennis match with Greenwald would make an entertaining narrative stunt. Greenwald declines, telling me that he\u2019s too good. \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel bad because I\u2019m going to destroy you, and you\u2019re going to try and get vengeance on me through the profile.\u201d That I\u2019m cooking up a savage hit piece becomes a running joke throughout my visit \u2014 as does Greenwald\u2019s inevitable reaction to my hit piece. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he imagines tweeting, \u201cNew York apparently has eliminated its entire editorial and fact-checking team as evidenced by this wretched article filled with lies. 1/29.\u201d\n\nIn truth, a hatchet job probably wouldn\u2019t bother Greenwald. He\u2019s long positioned himself as a radical adversary of the courtier press corps; a hostile story would confirm his view. Indeed, the formidable team of investigative journalists that surrounds Greenwald at the Intercept reflects this bent. But the ambitions of the First Look Media empire have also been hobbled by Greenwald\u2019s team-last M.O. In 2014, Greenwald co-wrote a lengthy piece documenting \u2014 and further contributing to \u2014 the company\u2019s managerial dysfunction.\n\nGreenwald\u2019s half-a-million-dollar Intercept salary reflects his role as the founder and figurehead of the organization. But since the Snowden revelations, Greenwald hasn\u2019t done much original reporting, and he has lately repositioned himself as a bomb-throwing media critic. This is in some ways a natural role for him, one that harks back to his early blogging days. \u201cHis general default position is that we shouldn\u2019t believe anything the elite Establishment politicians are saying without fact-checking them,\u201d says Jeremy Scahill, his Intercept co-founder. \u201cWe certainly shouldn\u2019t believe the anonymous proclamations of CIA, NSA, FBI officials.\u201d\n\nGreenwald\u2019s bunker mentality makes his Russia skepticism especially intuitive. \u201cEvery groove in his brain,\u201d one Greenwald critic told me, burnishes his suspicion that the political and media Establishment has a vested interest in promoting the story. His Bush-era awakening created a built-in distrust of national-security apparatuses; his focus on U.S. power abuses tends to outweigh concerns about threats to the homeland; his isolationism makes him wary of belligerent rhetoric; his civil libertarianism demands that unpopular views not be censored.\n\nIn 2012, many liberals who now consider Kremlin-linked Facebook memes an act of war mocked Mitt Romney for calling Russia our \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe.\u201d Greenwald, meanwhile, has been more consistent. \u201cHe\u2019s always minimized whatever the threat vector that people like me were concerned about,\u201d says Lawfare editor Ben Wittes, a longtime Greenwald opponent and unlikely celebrity of the Russiagate media sphere. \u201cHe\u2019s doing the exact same thing now. Just that the threat vector we\u2019re concerned about is the Russian state versus our leadership.\u201d Wittes adds, tongue in cheek: \u201cIn Glenn\u2019s defense, he has never purported to be a patriot.\u201d\n\nTo listen to intelligence veterans, there is also a defensive aspect to Greenwald\u2019s collusion skepticism. \u201cYou really cannot dismiss as part of his motivation the way in which this new story is undermining the very things that he made his reputation on,\u201d says cybersecurity expert Stewart Baker, a former NSA general counsel. \u201cWhich is: embracing WikiLeaks and Snowden and a hostility to the idea that there are national-security threats the U.S. has to respond to.\u201d\n\nJournalistically, the problem with this dynamic is there\u2019s virtually no revelation in the Russia story that could get Greenwald to change his mind. Which means that while Scahill and other Intercept colleagues tend to evaluate each new revelation at face value, Greenwald focuses disproportionately on debunked or overblown Russia stories. Ever the lawyer, he curates evidence that suits his argument. More than a year ago, the Washington Post published an erroneous story alleging that Russia had hacked into a U.S. electrical grid in Vermont. Greenwald continues to bring this up. To him, it\u2019s not just a random piece of bad reporting but a crucial exhibit in a case he\u2019s building.\n\nWhich makes his lack of interest in a report the Intercept itself produced all the more curious. In June, it published an explosive story that Russia had attempted to infiltrate voter-registration systems days before the election by sending phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials. The information came from a leaked NSA report; shortly before the Intercept published its story, a Georgia NSA employee named Reality Winner was arrested on espionage charges. Almost immediately, the Intercept was accused of exposing Winner with its own sloppy methods. But the scoop itself represented one of the first credible claims that, more than trying to influence American voters, Russia may have been directly targeting election technology. Greenwald distanced himself from the bungled leak at the time and now says he doesn\u2019t buy the story outright. \u201cI never liked the story. I thought it was bullshit and knew it was going to be huge in a way that was totally unjustified in what it actually revealed,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it tried to overstate the importance of what that document was.\u201d\n\nGreenwald\u2019s selective outrage has become habitual. In November, The Atlantic published Twitter correspondence from 2016 in which a WikiLeaks representative gave Donald Trump Jr. campaign advice.\n\nGreenwald pooh-poohed the coordination, implying that Julian Assange was just playing his usual 4-D chess. Barrett Brown \u2014 a pro-transparency autodidact who served more than four years in federal prison for spreading hacked data and won a National Magazine Award for Intercept essays he wrote while incarcerated \u2014 was livid. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be engaging on the actual revelations that keep coming out on Russia and Trump\u2019s people,\u201d Brown says. \u201cMy best guess is he\u2019s just ignoring these things in favor of the less difficult argument that some people who are backing the Trump-Russia narrative are full of shit.\u201d\n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t matter to Greenwald in the end how many new details emerge about Russia. The big truth \u2014 that American society is in dire need of reform and Russia is not to blame for that \u2014 can never be dislodged by the little truths. Still, in the weeks following my visit to Rio, Greenwald seemed to grow self-conscious of his alienated stance. On December 8, he emailed me that he\u2019d been asked to appear on the Sean Hannity Show to talk about his criticism of a CNN story about emails between Trump\u2019s team and WikiLeaks that he considered \u201cthe biggest fuck-up yet in the Trump/Russia story \u2014 totally humiliating.\u201d A few hours later, he reconsidered. \u201cActually I\u2019ve decided to take the opportunity to go on and just spend the whole time bashing the shit out of Fox and Hannity rather than doing what they want me to do: attacking CNN.\u201d Later, he sent this: \u201cReading up now on all the Fox Fake News scandals of the year \u2014 what a fucking list.\u201d\n\nUltimately, after being asked to appear on all three of Fox News\u2019 prime-time programs, he went on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show, where he fulfilled his promise to bash Fox News. The next morning, Greenwald tweeted a clip of the confrontation to his 940,000 followers, then immediately got into an argument with somebody called @hoboken1111.\n\n*This article appears in the January 22, 2018, issue of New York Magazine."}, "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/23710-building-a-movement-for-happiness": {"title": "Building a Movement for Happiness", "keywords": ["Truthout", " truth-out", " truth out", " independent news", " nonprofit news", " ad free news", " progressive news", " investigative reporting", " critical analysis", " BuzzFlash", " headlines", " commentary", " fracking", " Guantanamo", " mass incarceration", " prisons", " new economy", " police militarization", " climate change"], "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/23710-building-a-movement-for-happiness", "text": "Peter Shumlin, Governer of Vermont, US Department of Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, and Vermont Technical College students sample apples at the VTC orchard. Shumlin established Pursuit of Happiness Day three years ago. (Photo: Adam Caira / Department of Labor)\n\nVermont and Bhutan have embraced happiness rather than GDP as a measure of social success. The world's happiest countries share surprising characteristics - a small gap between rich and poor; work-life balance; urban design favoring community over cars; high degrees of interpersonal trust; a strong social safety net, and the highest tax rates in the world.\n\nYou probably missed it, but April 13, 2014, marked the third annual Pursuit of Happiness Day. April 13 just happens to be the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote those famous words \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" into our Declaration of Independence.\n\nJefferson and other American revolutionary leaders including Washington, Adams and Franklin all believed that the main purpose of government was increasing the happiness of its citizens. They said so on many occasions. But the idea of government promoting happiness or its corollary, \"wellbeing,\" is more often derided in contemporary politics - \"social engineering,\" some call it.\n\nOne significant exception is the state of Vermont. In addition to electing the most progressive and independent of US senators, Bernie Sanders, Vermont has become a laboratory for promoting new ways of understanding and promoting happiness and wellbeing. Its governor, Peter Shumlin, has proclaimed Pursuit of Happiness Day in Vermont for the past three years. Its legislature, with support from Democrats, Republicans and Progressive Party members, has established a state GPI or Genuine Progress Indicator, that uses some two dozen measures of health, wealth, education, leisure and sustainability to measure progress (Maryland has the same index and other states may follow soon).\n\nSo it's probably not surprising that Vermont has been the site of three of four national Happiness conferences in the US (Seattle hosted the other) and will be sponsoring the 5th Gross National Happiness Conference - Happiness and Wellbeing: Building a National Movement - in Burlington at the end of this month. Organizers hope the conference will help create a strategy for building public policies and personal change based on the goal of Sustainable and Equitable Wellbeing and Happiness.\n\nThe conference was inspired by a United Nations meeting, Wellbeing and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm, held in April 2012. At that meeting, then-Prime Minister of Bhutan, Jigmi Thinley, declared that\n\nThe tiny Himalayan nation of Bhutan, population 750,000 (about the same as Vermont), has been trying to measure and promote happiness as the goal of its government since its then-16-year old King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, proclaimed that \"Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product\" four decades ago. Its challenge to Gross National Product (now Gross Domestic Product), the standard by which other nations measure success, followed an earlier observation by US Senator Bobby Kennedy that GNP \"measures, in short, everything except that which makes life worthwhile.\"\n\nAs is now well-understood, GNP (or GDP) is a poor indicator of wellbeing - it measures the churn of money in a society. It creates an upside-down world in which many bad things - oil spills, traffic accidents, cancer, etc. - are measured positively because money must be spent to alleviate them, while many things essential to wellbeing - housework, volunteering, natural beauty, good health, etc. - are not counted at all (prompting Kennedy's comments). The Genuine Progress Indicators used in Vermont and Maryland are attempts to correct these clear design flaws in GDP.\n\nBhutan has brought leading experts in many disciplines from around the world to guide its progress toward its goal of Gross National Happiness. The country currently conducts bi-annual surveys to measure the wellbeing and happiness of its people, measuring progress in nine areas or \"domains\" of life considered especially important for happiness, including: physical health; mental health; education; quality of governance; social support and community vitality; environmental quality; time balance; access to arts, culture and recreation, and material wellbeing. In this model, material wellbeing - the primary goal of GDP - matters, but as only one of several important factors.\n\nBhutan has also created a \"happiness policy tool\" that allow lawmakers to understand the longer-term implications of proposed legislation on each domain of happiness. Its 24-member Gross National Happiness Commission evaluates major policy proposals using this tool and advises Bhutan's parliament regarding their likely impact. For example, using the tool, Bhutan turned down an offer to join the World Trade Organization. The proposal scored only 42 of 92 possible points in the GNH Commission analysis; 69 points are required for a positive recommendation.\n\nThe New Science of Happiness\n\nIn the days of Jefferson, it wasn't really possible to measure and assess national happiness and its causes. But in the past couple of decades, a new science of happiness, driven by advances in positive psychology and extensive studies of the brain, has allowed researchers to more thoroughly understand happiness and its roots in both public policy and human behavior. Gallup polls 1,000 Americans daily regarding their life satisfaction using a popular tool called the Cantril ladder: Perhaps not surprisingly, Americans are 20 percent happier on weekends than on workdays.\n\nGallup also uses the ladder and other measures to assess the happiness of 150 countries in the world each year. Consistently, northern European nations rank on top, with Denmark in the number one spot (at 7.7 out of 10) year after year. The United States, which ranked 11th in 2007, has dropped to 17th place (7.0 out of 10) since the great economic meltdown. Several factors in particular characterize the world's happiest countries - a relatively small gap between rich and poor; excellent work-life balance; urban design favoring community over cars; high degrees of interpersonal trust; a strong social safety net, and, contrary to popularly-held US ideas, the highest tax rates in the world.\n\nOrganizers of the Vermont conference hope to launch a movement that puts happiness and wellbeing at the forefront of policy ideas and educational goals. The event features more than 50 prominent speakers, including Vermont state Senator Anthony Pollina, author of the Vermont GPI legislation, Linda Wheatley and Tom Barefoot, lead organizers of GNHUSA, the Vermont organization that has been the primary conference organizer, Laura Musikanski of the Happiness Alliance based in Seattle, John Havens of Hacking H(app)iness and a writer for the British newspaper The Guardian. (Full disclosure: This author is also a speaker.)\n\n\"Bhutan may have first suggested that happiness and wellbeing be the primary focus of policymaking,\" says Linda Wheatley, conference organizer and co-founder of Vermont-based GNHUSA, \"but now, as we face indicators of economic, social and environmental distress, the whole world is seeing the value of that shift in orientation. It's time for an informed and inspired grassroots movement. We're thrilled to be part of that effort and invite everyone else to join us.\"\n\nParticipants will gather to share the tools, skills and resources for building happiness initiatives in other towns and cities across the country. The formal conference, on Thursday and Friday, will explore four content areas: Policy and Community Engagement; the Power of Data; Developing Happiness Skills, and Movement Building. Each segment will include a keynote and plenary presentations by well-known academics and activists in a variety of related fields, followed by workshops for further skill development. The very practical efforts currently underway in Vermont will be an important focus of the conversation.\n\nThe formal conference, on Thursday, May 29 and Friday, May 30, will be followed on the weekend by a series of add-on trainings including a focus on spiritual traditions and on conducting happiness surveys and using happiness policy tools in local communities.\n\nUntil now, what has been happening in Bhutan, and more recently, in the state of Vermont, has been under the radar of most Americans. Conference organizers hope this gathering will help change that.\n\n\"We'll be looking at best practices to improve wellbeing and happiness from throughout the world,\" says Tom Barefoot of GNHUSA. \"At a time when so much of our news is a litany of inequality and environmental destruction, making happiness our goal instead of more money, stuff and consumerism is common sense. The scientific evidence shows that social connection, participation, good health and access to nature matter far more for wellbeing than an ever-growing GDP. It's time for that evidence to get out there more widely.\""}, "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42451100": {"title": "Catalan ex-leader demands Spain talks", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42451100", "text": "Catalonia's ousted leader, Carles Puigdemont, has called for new talks with Spain after separatist parties won a slim majority in a regional election.\n\nHe said he wanted the negotiations in Brussels, where he is living in self-imposed exile, or another EU country.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy later appeared to reject the idea.\n\nHe said he would hold talks with the head of the new Catalan government but that leader would have to take up their post in Catalonia itself.\n\nHe avoided naming Mr Puigdemont, adding that the winner of Thursday's election was In\u00e9s Arrimadas, the leader of the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain.\n\nThe Citizens party is now the region's biggest party. although pro-independence parties are best placed to form a government.\n\n\"Catalonia wants to be an independent state,\" said Mr Puigdemont, speaking in Belgium on Friday. \"This is the wish of the Catalan people. I think the plan of [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy is not working, so we have to find new ways to tackle this crisis.\"\n\nMr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) recorded its worst ever result in Thursday's vote.\n\nHe had hoped that the poll would restore stability and said the Spanish government was \"willing to talk in a realistic way and inside the law\" with a future Catalan government.\n\n\"I offer Catalonia this because we care about the people\" he said.\n\nThe Spanish government imposed direct rule on Catalonia and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal.\n\nMr Puigdemont has also called on the prime minister to repatriate all the police sent to Catalonia before the referendum.\n\nWith nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Together for Catalonia (JxCat), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were on course to win a total of 70 seats in total, giving them a majority in the new parliament.\n\nCitizens (Cs) had 25.3% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber.\n\nIts leader told the BBC her party had been \"victorious\". Ms In\u00e9s Arrimadas said forming a coalition would be \"difficult - but we will try\".\n\nThe PP, meanwhile, won only three seats, down from 11 in the previous assembly.\n\nTurnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election.\n\nLeading Spanish newspapers say that the result has strengthened the government's position.\n\n\"Nationalism can no longer claim that it exclusively represents Catalonia,\" says Madrid-based La Raz\u00f3n. ABC newspaper thinks Madrid should now settle the Catalan crisis. \"If Spain wants to win this fight in the long term and prevent Catalonia from leaving one day, it should draft a serious plan for strengthening the state.\"\n\nThe result seems to have split Catalan papers between those who want the independence project to continue, and those who accept the realpolitik of the election result.\n\n\"The independence movement has humiliated the Spanish prime minister,\" El Nacional says. \"The decisions that affect Catalonia are not made in Madrid.\"\n\nBut Barcelona's El Peri\u00f3dico says the result means a \"divided Catalonia\". \"The election that Mariano Rajoy called has shown that Catalonia is firmly divided in two blocs and there is hardly any space for intermediaries.\"\n\nLa Vanguardia writes: \"Major forces supporting independence should look back, confess to mistakes and avoid making them again,\"\n\nSeparatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October after a referendum that was declared illegal by Spain.\n\nIn an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots.\n\nThe move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured.\n\nAccording to referendum organisers, 90% of voters were in favour of independence, but fewer than half the region's electorate took part.\n\nHowever, Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain.\n\nMr Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election.\n\nProsecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium.\n\nAmong the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail.\n\nThe European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result.\n\nThe executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain.\n\n\"Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels.

As things stand, he faces arrest, should he enter Spain.\n\nCatalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years.\n\nBefore the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under General Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75.\n\nWhen Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again under the 1978 constitution, and the region prospered along with the rest of the new, democratic Spain.\n\nA 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a \"nation\", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010.\n\nRecession and cuts in public spending fuelled local resentment, which coalesced in a powerful secessionist movement.\n\nFollowing a trial referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election and went on to win a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also banned and boycotted by unionists."}, "https://antifascistnews.net/2017/04/09/richard-spencer-just-got-his-ass-kicked-and-glitter-bombed-videos/": {"title": "Richard Spencer Just Got His Ass Kicked and Glitter Bombed [VIDEOS]", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://antifascistnews.net/2017/04/09/richard-spencer-just-got-his-ass-kicked-and-glitter-bombed-videos/", "text": "News is just coming in that Alt Right leader Richard Spencer was just pulled out of a cab in Washington D.C., beat up, and had glitter thrown all over him.

Spencer is an anti-interventionist from a nationalist perspective, one that is shared by the far-right wing of the anti-imperialist movement. He has now called for an anti-war movement from the Alt Right, and thought he would join an action in Washington D.C. to speak out against the disaster of sending missiles overseas.\n\n He came out arguing that Assad was a reasonable and \u201csecular\u201d person in the region, and that there should be \u201cpeaceful and mutually beneficial relationship\u201d with the U.S. and Assad\u2019s regime.

Anti-fascists surrounded and shouted them down as they broadcast on Periscope and got cheers from their small echo chamber of white nationalists.\n\nWhen the anti-fascists overwhelmed the Alt Right \u201cprotest,\u201d Spencer took off running to get into a cab as he was confronted directly by the opposition.\n\nWhen he was getting into the cab he was allegedly pulled out by counter-protesters, punched, and glitter bombed. In a video posted on Periscope shortly there after, Spencer said what happened was that Antifa disallowed him to get in his \u201cgetaway\u201d car and the police instructed him to get in a cab. Once he was in one the cab driver (who Spencer mocked for being of Indian origin) got out of the cab, frightened of the ensuing protesters, and Spencer had to take off running. The Alt Right seems unwilling to understand that just because they oppose Syrian intervention for nationalist reasons, they are not going to find allies on the anti-war left. Militant anti-fascist resistance has been firmed up in the country, and no one is going to give them an inch. These kinds of poorly organized Alt Right activist engagements are likely to continue, especially on college campuses, though they lack any kind of long-term strategy."}, "https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/31/frances-socialists-are-losing-to-a-communist/": {"title": "France's Socialists Are Losing to a Communist", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/31/frances-socialists-are-losing-to-a-communist/", "text": "PARIS \u2014 Earlier this month, I joined the estimated 130,000 Frenchmen who answered the call of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the very-far-left presidential candidate, to stage a \u201cMarch for the Sixth Republic\u201d from the Bastille to the Place de la R\u00e9publique in Paris. Among other radical positions, M\u00e9lenchon argues that the Fifth Republic, which was declared by Charles De Gaulle in 1958 and enshrined a monarchical presidency, has reached the end of its useful life and that it\u2019s time for a new, more democratic, more egalitarian France. M\u00e9lenchon is a left-wing populist who compares himself to Bernie Sanders. Like Sanders, M\u00e9lenchon speaks to the widespread desire of voters on the left to rewrite the orthodox rules of politics. These voters are the other side \u2014 the side we have tended to overlook \u2014 of the polarization of politics across the West.\n\nM\u00e9lenchon, 65, spent his career as a Socialist Party backbencher until 2008, when he bolted to form his own Left Party. In 2012, he ran for president and captured a respectable 11 percent of the vote. In that election, the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande defeated right-wing incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. But M\u00e9lenchon viewed Hollande as the Tweedledum to Sarkozy\u2019s Tweedledee \u2014 an apostle of globalism, neoliberalism, and financial austerity, and a puppet of the \u201cEurocrats\u201d who \u201cdream\u201d of locking \u201cthe people in an open-air prison,\u201d as he recently put it in his very pungent (and long-winded) weekly blog post. In February 2016, long before any other candidate had declared him or herself, M\u00e9lenchon announced that he would run once again, now as the standard-bearer of another self-created party, La France Insoumise (France Standing Tall, more or less).\n\nM\u00e9lenchon has no real chance of becoming president and is unlikely to finish higher than fourth in the first round of the upcoming presidential elections. He may well, however, come out ahead of Beno\u00eet Hamon, the Socialist candidate. That would constitute an immense moral victory for M\u00e9lenchon and his votaries, and an absolute calamity for the Socialists, who, like traditional center-left parties all over Europe, suddenly find themselves in free fall. Earlier this week, Hamon implored M\u00e9lenchon \u2014 and not for the first time \u2014 to withdraw his candidacy in order to create a united left front. M\u00e9lenchon responded by telling a crowd of 5,000 supporters that \u201cIt is to you that I bound myself. I will negotiate nothing with anyone.\u201d\n\nI asked everyone I met at the march what was wrong with Hamon, who, after all, represents the left wing of France\u2019s institutional left party. The first person I asked, Daniel Monnet, who, as it turned out, was running for parliament on M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s list in the Haute-Marne district in the northeast, said that the problem wasn\u2019t Hamon\u2019s program, but his party. \u201cThe Socialist Party has betrayed us,\u201d he said, \u201cand betrayed working people. Despite all his promises, Hollande accomplished only one progressive thing during his tenure \u2014 \u201cmarriage for all,\u201d or gay marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely true that Hollande has governed as a centrist, pleasing neither left nor right. He instituted budget cuts to reduce France\u2019s deficit, offering little resistance to the German-led austerity caucus in the European Union. Worse still, if that\u2019s possible, he continued Sarkozy\u2019s campaign to liberalize French labor rules, passing \u2014 in the face of mass protests \u2014 an employment law that allows individual companies to bypass such key rules as the 35-hour workweek. M\u00e9lenchon, by contrast, has called for massive new government spending to stimulate the economy and a \u201crelocalization of production\u201d enabled by a new regime of protectionism. He\u2019s vowed to renegotiate France\u2019s relationship with the EU \u2014 or leave. He would establish workers\u2019 committees at the heart of big companies with the power to veto the boss\u2019s decisions to close factories, lay off workers, or move capital abroad.\n\nAs a young man, M\u00e9lenchon was a Trotskyist, but he joined the Socialists rather than enlist in a Communist Party that would become increasingly marginal after the 1970s. He rose through the ranks of the party in Essonne, a department southwest of Paris, ultimately serving as a junior minister under Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin from 2000 to 2002. But having grown up in Morocco, attended a regional university, and worked as a teacher, M\u00e9lenchon was never fully comfortable in the party\u2019s intensely elitist culture, any more than he was with its mainstream social democratic principles.\n\nM\u00e9lenchon now enjoys the support, albeit grudging, of the Communist Party, which views him as a reckless individualist rather than a disciplined cadre. The party\u2019s red flag waved all along the route of the march. People also carried signs that read (in French) \u201cShare the Wealth\u201d and \u201cDemocracy in the Workplace,\u201d though also \u201cDeath With Dignity\u201d and \u201cNo More Stop and Frisk.\u201d\n\nOne of the compelling features of M\u00e9lenchonism is that it fuses the most intensely nostalgic elements of the French left with the most avant-garde. For the young people in the crowd \u2014 and there were a great many \u2014 M\u00e9lenchon was the ardent \u201cecologist\u201d who would replace nuclear facilities with wind farms and solar batteries. For the oldsters, he\u2019s the sworn enemy of capitalists and the moneyed power. M\u00e9lenchon also defends the rights of immigrants and refugees, a brave position given the profound anger at both that has driven French politics to the right. However, he has played to nativist sentiment by complaining that the \u201cposted workers\u201d sent to France from low-wage EU countries \u201ctook the bread out of French workers\u2019 mouths.\u201d No one I talked to at the march raised M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s defense of immigrants as a reason for supporting him. In his speech the candidate steered clear of this supremely neuralgic question.\n\nFor the French left, the backward look is far more enthralling than the forward gaze; the past is where hope lies. The speakers who appeared on the stage before M\u00e9lenchon read a poem Victor Hugo had written to celebrate the doomed Paris Commune of 1871, two works of the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, a passage from Albert Camus on the imperative to resist fascism, and a fragment of Jean-Paul Sartre: \u201cThere is no human nature; man is what he does.\u201d Gerard Miller, a psychoanalyst who had made a documentary on M\u00e9lenchon, urged the crowd not to \u201cfall into the trap of \u2018How much does it cost?\u2019\u201d Rather, \u201cat the outset you must demand what is desirable.\u201d The crowd roared, \u201cResistance! Resistance!\u201d\n\nAnd then M\u00e9lenchon, a stocky man with a red tie \u2014 always red \u2014 showing through his rather chic open-necked black sweater, took the stage. M\u00e9lenchon is, as the French say, a \u201ctribune\u201d \u2014 an orator who knows how to stir the masses. The melodramatic vocabulary of the Revolution, the Commune, and the anti-fascist struggle of the 20th century issues from him as fluently as Elizabethan English from a gifted Shakespearean actor. \u201cListen to the sound that rises from our ranks,\u201d he cried to the great throng. \u201cThis sound has no name, like the sound of the wind in the leaves, like that of the rain on the pavement. The sound has no name, but it is a sign \u2014 that of the people when it arises in its history.\u201d It might sound like malarkey to a nonbeliever; to this crowd it was nectar.\n\nM\u00e9lenchon raged against \u201ca presidential monarchy\u201d \u2014 the semi-regal, unaccountable French head of state \u2014 \u201cand its close collusion with the kingpins of finance who subjugate and dominate.\u201d He insisted that the Socialist Hollande, like his right-wing predecessor Sarkozy, had surrendered French sovereignty to a European Union where \u201call power is given to a wholly independent central bank whose sole mission is the protection of rent\u201d \u2014 a term straight out of Das Kapital. M\u00e9lenchon also said that workers must exercise greater control over \u201cthe means of production.\u201d For all of M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s facility with social media and his conversion to the cause of environmentalism, he seemed to be summoning his followers to join him in a glorious crusade to the 19th century.\n\nThe center-left parties of Europe, which for decades dominated both its politics and political culture, have lost their way. In the Dutch elections last month, the Labour Party finished seventh, plummeting from 38 seats in Parliament to nine. The British Labour Party has been rendered almost nonfunctional by splits within its ranks provoked by hard-left party leader Jeremy Corbyn. France\u2019s Socialist Party still enjoys a near-majority in the National Assembly and holds many of the country\u2019s most important mayoralties, but Hollande has suffered from record unpopularity almost throughout his tenure. Hamon may win little more than 10 percent of French votes. (Social Democratic parties do, however, continue to enjoy support in Germany and elsewhere in northern Europe, though at a lower level than they had been accustomed to in recent years.)\n\nEuropean postwar center-left parties were built on a base of unionized workers who enjoyed rising incomes as well as growing benefits from the welfare state, but also appealed to urban professionals and intellectuals. That coalition began to delaminate as white-collar jobs eclipsed blue-collar ones; the process has accelerated since the economic crisis of 2008 put an end to rising incomes. Marc Lazar, a historian at Sciences Po in Paris, argues that it is far too early to count the Socialists out for good. Nevertheless, he observes, Europe\u2019s center-left parties have been losing supporters in three directions. Successful professionals have been leaving for \u201cthird-way\u201d parties like Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche!, or the parties have repositioned themselves to the right, as is the case with Italy\u2019s Democratic Party, the heir to older left-wing and social democratic groupings. The blue-collar base has defected to the far right, whether France\u2019s National Front or the UK Independence Party. Still others, including teachers and other civil servants, have found their way to left-of-the-left groupings, like La France Insoumise. Many leaders of France\u2019s Socialist Party have announced that they will support Macron rather than Hamon. The latest was Manuel Valls, prime minister for most of Francois Hollande\u2019s tenure. The Socialists seem to be crumbling away by the hour.\n\nThe Communist boilerplate that I heard at the march has deep and deeply romantic sources in France. Lazar is the author of Communism: The French Passion, and he reminded me that the Communists had been France\u2019s leading party from the end of World War II to De Gaulle\u2019s victory in 1958. The Communists were the party of both workers and intellectuals. M\u00e9lenchon draws from a historical legacy and a sense of romance that has outlasted the party itself. As Lazar puts it, \u201cAnti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, the idea that there is just one way to change, and that is towards Communism \u2014 this culture remains part of the politics of France.\u201d The appeal of this noble atavism has only grown as the dynamic of globalization has increasingly compelled the parties of both the center-left and -right to bow before the laws of the marketplace \u2014 embracing fiscal austerity, free trade, the free movement of capital and labor. The dream of escape from these apparently iron laws is especially potent in France, where a poll recently found that only one of four respondents viewed free trade as an opportunity rather than a threat. In England, Brexit notwithstanding, the figure was twice as high.\n\nThe first of three presidential debates took place last Monday. Only the five leading candidates were invited \u2014 Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon of the center-right Republicans, Emmanuel Macron of En Marche!, Beno\u00eet Hamon of the Socialists, and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. The debate lasted a stupefying three hours. And it was three hours of policy. Incredibly, neither of the two moderators asked Fillon about the scandals that have engulfed his campaigns, a lengthy list that begins with apparently giving his wife and children no-show jobs in his legislative office and ends \u2014 for now \u2014 with an allegation that a Lebanese billionaire paid Fillon $50,000 to set up meetings for him with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the head of the French oil giant Total. Le Pen, who has been accused of billing the European Union for the salaries of party workers, emerged similarly unscathed. The rival candidates raised the alleged improprieties only by way of delicate allusion. All present seemed to regard fiscal crimes with the tact which the French famously bring to extramarital sex.\n\nThe debate featured some exceptionally clarifying moments, however, above all on the question of immigration and French identity, the obsession of the National Front. Le Pen claimed that every year France absorbs 200,000 legal immigrants (the net figure is about half) and probably as many illegal ones (the state reported around 50,000 illegal immigrants per year every year between 2013 and 2015), and that terrorists were exploiting the flow to gain a foothold in France. She called for limiting the annual figure to 10,000, and for waging a campaign against \u201cthe pressure of these incessant claims in matters of food and clothing\u201d \u2014 i.e., efforts by Muslim immigrants to keep pork out of schools and grant women the right to wear the veil. Fillon, though more cautiously seeking the xenophobic vote, declared that French Muslims must act against the rise of \u201cint\u00e9grisme\u201d \u2014 resistance to assimilation \u2014 and that France must tightly regulate the hiring of imams and the foreign funding of mosques.\n\nMacron, who seemed largely intent on not offending either left or right, seized the moment by saying, \u201cThe trap in which you are in the process of falling, Mademoiselle Le Pen, by your provocations, is to divide society,\u201d which is to make 4 million French Muslims \u201cenemies of the republic.\u201d M\u00e9lenchon, who risks losing working-class voters by refusing, even sotto voce, to sympathize with their rising anger against newcomers, ridiculed Le Pen\u2019s proposal for strict limits. \u201cBut do you want to throw them in the sea?\u201d he said, and asked voters to sympathize with the desperation that brought refugees to Europe. \u201cIf we were in their condition, we would also leave.\u201d M\u00e9lenchon is often accused of being a populist, but a strong thread of moral universalism runs through all his views.\n\nNevertheless, in the course of the evening it became clear that in other respects M\u00e9lenchon and Le Pen have much in common. Sounding very much like Le Pen, M\u00e9lenchon said that France needed to \u201cturn the page from chemical agriculture\u201d \u2014agribusiness \u2014 to small-scale \u201cpeasant agriculture.\u201d Sounding very much like M\u00e9lenchon, Le Pen complained that \u201cultra-liberalism\u201d and free trade had \u201cruined\u201d French agriculture and industry. The state, she said, must openly favor French businesses and protect them from foreign competition. Both stoutly defended France\u2019s sacrosanct 35-hour workweek; M\u00e9lenchon has said he would like to go to 32.\n\nOne way of looking at the debate, and at French politics today, is as a referendum on the conditions and prospects of the West. Macron, the English-speaking youthful ex-banker and Blairite liberal, wants France to embrace globalization and free markets, at least insofar as one can divine views that he prefers to keep blurry. Fillon is a cultural conservative who appeals to Frenchmen and women, especially Catholics, who fear the loss of a traditional order, but he\u2019s also a Thatcherite who champions deregulation. Hamon is a classic social democrat who repudiates austerity in favor of Keynesian investment, but does not fundamentally dispute the merits of the private market.\n\nAnd that leaves Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and Marine Le Pen, the practitioners, respectively, of a politics of economic and cultural nostalgia. Both promise to lead their followers to green pastures purged of ugly toadstools, whether financiers or Moroccan immigrants. Both regard incrementalism, the steady shaping of the world as it is, as a trap set by the enemies of the people. Both regard the state as the sole bulwark against the impersonal forces that dominate the world. It\u2019s no surprise that large numbers of industrial workers in France\u2019s northern Rust Belt, once the bulwark of the left, seem to be defecting to the National Front.\n\nNevertheless, there is a world of difference between the xenophobia and provincialism of the far right and the cosmopolitan and fraternal spirit of the Marxist left. Most people I spoke to at the march seemed angrier about the harm the EU had done to Greece than about the alleged damage to France. Because we live in an era in which cultural fears are even more potent than economic ones, M\u00e9lenchon cannot compete with Le Pen for the votes of those who fear that French identity is under attack. It is almost a mathematical certainty that Le Pen will advance from the first round of voting to the second, and that M\u00e9lenchon will not. Yet M\u00e9lenchon was widely viewed as the shining light of the debate, witty and eloquent and fully at ease. Hamon, by contrast, was generally subdued, despite getting in a few good shots at Macron. M\u00e9lenchon has said that this will be his last election. If so, he may close his career by out-polling the Socialist candidate. Given his oft-expressed contempt for the party, this would count as sweet vengeance.\n\nBeyond this, it would be foolish to predict what French voters will do. Macron may come to appear callow next to the gravelly, bushy-browed Fillon, whose florid misdeeds may be forgiven. Or Macron could face Le Pen in the second round but lose, current polls notwithstanding, because too much of the moderate right embraces the far right and too much of the left stays home. (Virtually everyone at M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s march told me that they would refuse to vote, or submit a blank ballot, in a contest between Le Pen and Macron.) In the Dutch election earlier this month, the center held. In France, where the sound of the people rising is like the wind in the leaves, it may not.\n\nHaving witnessed Trump and Brexit, the French are knocking on wood and whistling past graveyards. So much is at stake in this election. For once, the French conviction that their nation stands at the very heart of world affairs is all too true."}, "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/41532-the-largest-fascist-rally-in-recent-memory-is-expected-this-week-can-the-left-unite-against-it": {"title": "The Largest Fascist Rally in Recent Memory Is Expected This Week -- Can the Left Unite Against It?", "keywords": ["Politics and Elections; Human Rights; far-right; neo-Nazis; white nationalists; Ku Klux Klan; Charlottesville; anti-fa; counter-protest; alt-right", " far right", " Human Rights", " NeoNazis", " Politics and Elections"], "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/41532-the-largest-fascist-rally-in-recent-memory-is-expected-this-week-can-the-left-unite-against-it", "text": "The Ku Klux Klan protests on July 8, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Photo: Chet Strange / Getty Images)\n\nThe August 12 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, looks like it will be the largest organized racist demonstration in recent memory. But that's not the only reason it is important. First, while there have been dozens of far-right rallies since Trump's election, this will be the first major, national rally run by the alt-right's openly white nationalist wing. Second, after months of arguments, this is also an opportunity for a large swath of progressives to come together in opposition to the far right.\n\nCharlottesville has seen multiple white nationalist rallies this year. The first, a May 2017 daytime event, was followed by a nighttime torchlight photo-op. Led by alt-right poster boy Richard Spencer, attendees chanted Nazi slogans like \"blood and soil.\" The second, in July, was a KKK rally. This time, counter-protesters were out in force; one outlet put the numbers at 30 KKK supporters versus 1,000 protesters. But the police arrested 23 counter-protesters, and some counter-protesters were charged with a felony for merely wearing a mask.\n\nThe white nationalist rallies are ostensibly being held to oppose the removal of a statue of former Confederate Army General Robert E. Lee. The city council agreed to the removal in April, but it is being fought in the courts. Now white nationalists are making a show of force at rallies based on this increasingly strained pretext.\n\nSince Trump took power in February, there have been numerous far right marches, which have congealed into a street protest movement. I have dubbed it \"Independent Trumpism\" because, while it fanatically supports Trump and his anti-immigrant and Islamophobic politics, the organizing happens outside of the Republican Party apparatus itself.\n\nThese started as supposed \"free speech\" rallies -- in reality, ultra-nationalist gatherings to show they could hold the streets after antifascists forced the cancellation of a Milo Yiannopoulos talk at the University of California, Berkeley, in February 2017.\n\nThe marches then branched out to both oppose the removal of Confederate statutes, and support Islamophobic rallies like June's \"March Against Sharia.\" Mostly they have been organized by \"alt-lite\" activists, who stop just short of embracing a homogenous white country, with everyone from Trumpist Republicans to militias to open fascists in attendance. And while Richard Spencer did not go to any of them, fascist groups like Identity Evropa and Vanguard America did -- although they were not key organizers and tended to have a low-key presence.\n\nThis week's \"Unite the Right\" event will be different. While attempting to pull from the same broad pool of Trumpists, this time the rally will be led by a star-studded cast of fascist and other white nationalist leaders and groups. Those supporting it claim over a thousand people will come.\n\nRichard Spencer will headline the event; he attended college in Charlottesville and given the repeated rallies, it looks like he hopes to turn the town into an organizing base. Another famous alt-right figure, Mike Enoch of The Right Stuff, will also speak.\n\nThe organizer of \"Unite the Right,\" Jason Kessler, is a white nationalist who wrote for the Daily Caller. Embracing the racist creed that white people are an oppressed group, he's said that \"the number one thing\" he wants from the rally is \"to destigmatize Pro-White advocacy.\"\n\nKessler originally sought the attendance of a wider swath of Trumpist activists, going so far as to denounce the earlier KKK rally. But as the event approaches, it has become more clearly an open white nationalist -- and even neo-Nazi -- event. Four groups in the Nationalist Front, a national umbrella organization of racist groups, are attending. Matthew Heimbach of the fascist Traditionalist Worker Party and Michael Hill of the neo-Confederate League of the South will both speak. The National Socialist Movement, the largest US neo-Nazi party, recently announced it will attend. (Their presence is the welcome sign for hardened, open neo-Nazis -- who've generally shied away from being visible at past alt-right events -- to come in force.) And last, the fascist alt-right group Vanguard America, which recently joined the Nationalist Front, will be there.\n\nThey will be joined by alt-right figures who stop just short of claiming the mantle of racial purity for themselves, but will happily collaborate with those who do. These include Augustus Invictus, a Florida lawyer who has defended the neo-Nazi skinhead gang American Front and ran as a Libertarian Party candidate for Senate, and Baked Alaska, a former Buzzfeed editor who now promotes white nationalism. Members of the alt-right fight gang the Proud Boys are also expected.\n\nWhile this is a mess of fascists and their friends, some are still attempting to portray the \"Unite the Right\" as a neutral event. The fascist Traditionalist Worker Party says \"the event's not about race\" and that they welcome \"non-White allies.\"\n\nThe left is organizing in response to the rally, although not nearly on the same national scale. This will be a mistake, however, if a thousand Nazis take the streets and proceed to make Charlottesville a new base. If there is one thing that I learned from witnessing the Nazi and Klan boom in the 1980s and '90s, it was that Nazis hate opposition. If you give a Nazi organizer an inch, they will be thrilled by the lack of resistance and proceed to take a mile. Floyd Cochran, an Aryan Nations organizer during this period, revealed that if his group encountered resistance in towns they targeted for recruitment, they moved on.\n\nRegional groups have been organizing against \"Unite the Right.\" These include chapters of Showing Up for Racial Justice, Black Lives Matter and Redneck Revolt, as well as socialist, anarchist and antifascist groups. A coalition of religious progressives, Congregate Charlottesville, has called for \"1,000 clergy and faith leaders to join\" the counter-protest, and Cornel West has said he will attend.\n\nFollowing the demonstrations in Berkeley at the beginning of the year, a number of progressives issued vocal criticisms of the use of confrontational strategies against the far right. These attacks by moderates on antifascist radicals helped lower attendance at counter-demonstrations. Simultaneously, the far right was able to create an unusual Trumpist Republican-Nazi-militia street coalition. This has helped propel far right organizing to new heights.\n\nWhile arguments on the Left over how to deal with the Far Right go back many decades, the strategy of sitting by and doing no more than documenting its rise because opposing it \"will give them attention\" has never been a successful approach. Neither has counting on law enforcement to arrest those who break the law.\n\nIn practice, since February, few groups outside of antifascist circles have done national-level, longer-term, nuts-and-bolts organizing on the ground against the organized far-right groups. For example, there has been no new wave of regional anti-far-right groups like those which existed in the 1980s and '90s. These groups did not engage in militant direct action but did build grassroots opposition to Nazi and Klan groups. But, outside of Redneck Revolt, there is not even a sustained effort to create online counter-propaganda. (Although one of the few initiatives by moderate groups has been to limit the far right's use of social media and online fundraising platforms.) There have been localized demonstrations -- in Portland in June after the murder of two men by an Islamophobic racist, and later in the month against a national day of Islamophobic rallies -- but these haven't gelled into any coherent organization or strategy.\n\nThe Charlottesville rally has the potential to unite differing radical and progressive activists who oppose white nationalist organizing, and this opportunity should not be squandered. A broad-based, progressive coalition of groups with different analyses and approaches is needed to counter this new, reinvigorated far right. If these groups can't cooperate, they should at least be able to leave each other alone to pursue their own strategies. But that should not mean staying home and ignoring public far right activism. When far right organizers try to take over our cities, the one thing that progressives can't do is to respond with silence. In the face of an aggressive racist movement, silence is consent."}, "https://www.salon.com/2017/11/08/american-hyper-capitalism-breeds-the-lonely-alienated-men-who-become-mass-killers_partner/": {"title": "American hyper-capitalism breeds the lonely, alienated men who become mass killers", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.salon.com/2017/11/08/american-hyper-capitalism-breeds-the-lonely-alienated-men-who-become-mass-killers_partner/", "text": "Even when he managed an activity that brought him money, it tended to be in areas not associated with hard work in connection with others.

The Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation disappeared, and democracy and free-markets spread across the now defeated Soviet empire. Of course, 25 years later, events didn\u2019t exactly unfold as initially predicted. The forces of globalization have mutated former Soviet countries in unseen ways, emboldening autocrats and entrenching corruption across the region. Meanwhile, the geopolitical animosities of the Cold War are resurgent, with relations between Moscow and Washington at their lowest point since the Soviet-era arms race. The creation of new countries, meanwhile, has given rise to nationalism and autocracies that are shaping foreign-policy decisions and altering societies in unforeseen ways.\n\nYet, the significance of this quarter-century of change is still not fully understood. Why did the Soviet Union really collapse and what lessons have policymakers missed? How is history repeating itself across the lands of the former superpower? In search of answers, Foreign Policy asked six experts with intimate knowledge of the region from their time in finance, academia, journalism, and policymaking. Here are the unlearned lessons from the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviet Union is still collapsing. \u2013 Serhii Plokhy\n\nMoscow is still sacrificing innovation for state security. \u2013 Andrei Soldatov\n\nThe Soviet Union is still collapsing.\n\nSerhii Plokhy is the professor of history and director of the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University. He is the author of The Last Empire: The Final Days of the Soviet Union, The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine, and his latest book is The Man with the Poison Gun: A Cold War Spy Story.\n\nThe 20th century witnessed the end of the world built and ruled by empires: from Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, which fell in the final days of World War I, to the British and French empires, which disintegrated in the aftermath of World War II. This decades-long process concluded with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the mighty successor to the Russian Empire, which was stitched back together by the Bolsheviks in the early 1920s, only to fall apart 70 years later during the final stage of the Cold War.\n\nAlthough many factors contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union, from the bankruptcy of communist ideology to the failure of the Soviet economy, the wider context for its dissolution is often overlooked. The collapse of the Soviet Union, like the disintegration of past empires, is a process rather than an event. And the collapse of the last empire is still unfolding today. This process did not end with Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s resignation on Christmas Day 1991, and its victims are not limited to the three people who died defending the Moscow White House in August 1991 or the thousands of casualties from the Chechen wars.\n\nThe rise of nation-states on the ruins of the Soviet Union, like the rise of successor states on the remains of every other empire, mobilized ethnicity, nationalism, and conflicting territorial claims. This process at least partly explains the Russian annexation of Crimea, the war in Ukraine, and the burst of popular support for those acts of aggression in the Russian Federation. As the victim of a much more powerful neighbor\u2019s attack, Ukraine found itself in a situation similar to that of the new states of Eastern Europe formed after World War I on the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires. Those states struggled with the enormous tasks of nation building while trying to accommodate national minorities and defend themselves against revanchist powers claiming the loyalty of those same minorities.\n\nAlthough the historical context of the collapse of empires helps us understand the developments of the last 25 years in the former Soviet space, it also serves as a warning for the future. The redrawing of post-imperial borders to reflect the importance of nationality, language, and culture has generally come about as a result of conflicts and wars, some of which went on for decades, if not centuries. The Ottoman Empire began its slow-motion collapse in 1783, a process that reached its conclusion at the end of World War I. The ongoing war in eastern Ukraine is not the only reminder that the process of Soviet disintegration is still incomplete. Other such reminders are the frozen or semi-frozen conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the semi-independent state of Chechnya.\n\nA lesson that today\u2019s policymakers can learn from the history of imperial collapse is that the role of the international community is paramount in sorting out relations between former rulers and subjects. Few stable states have emerged from the ruins of bygone empires without strong international support, whether it is the French role in securing American independence, Russian and British involvement in the struggle for Greek statehood, or the U.S. role in supporting the aspirations of former Warsaw Pact countries in Eastern Europe. The role of outsiders has been and will remain the key to any post-imperial settlement. Looking at the current situation, it\u2019s difficult to overstate the role the United States and its NATO allies can play in solving the conflict in Ukraine and other parts of the volatile post-Soviet space. The fall of the Soviet Union, which carried the legacy of the last European empire, is still far from over. RETURN TO LIST.\n\nBill Browder is the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and the head of the Global Campaign for Justice for Sergei Magnitsky.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed 25 years ago, the world breathed a collective sigh of relief as the threat of nuclear annihilation was all but eliminated. Russia transitioned into a democracy, and the West could refocus its efforts on peace and prosperity. In the process, however, the pendulum swung from intense anxiety toward Moscow to inattention and neglect.\n\nUnfortunately, while the West was ignoring Russia, it was quietly mutating into something far more dangerous than the Soviet Union.\n\nWith no real laws or institutions, 22 Russian oligarchs stole 40 percent of the country\u2019s wealth from the state. The other 150 million Russians were left in destitution and poverty, and the average life expectancy for men dropped from 65 to 57 years. Professors had to earn a living as taxi drivers; nurses became prostitutes. The entire fabric of Russian society broke down.\n\nMeanwhile, the West wasn\u2019t just ignoring the looting of Russia; it was actively facilitating it. Western banks accepted pilfered funds from Russian clients, and Western real estate agencies welcomed oligarchs to buy their most coveted properties in St-Tropez, Miami, and London.\n\nThe injustice of it all was infuriating for average Russians, and they longed for a strongman to restore order. In 1999, they found one: Vladimir Putin. Rather than restoring order, however, Putin replaced the 22 oligarchs with himself alone at the top. From my own research, I estimate that in his 18 years in power he has stolen $200 billion from the Russian people.\n\nPutin did allow a fraction of Russia\u2019s oil wealth to seep into the population \u2014 just enough to prevent an uprising, but nowhere near enough to reverse the horrible injustice of the situation. But that didn\u2019t last long either. As the oil boom waned, the suffering of ordinary Russians resumed, and people took to the streets in 2011 and 2012 to protest his rule. Putin\u2019s method of dealing with an angry population comes from the standard dictator playbook: If your people are mad at you, start wars. This was the real reason behind his invasion of Ukraine, and it worked amazingly well: Putin\u2019s approval rating skyrocketed from 65 percent to 89 percent in a few months.\n\nIn response to the annexation of Crimea, the war in Ukraine, and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which killed 298 innocent people, the West had no choice but to respond with a range of sanctions against Russia. These sanctions, combined with the collapse of oil prices, led to more economic hardship, which made the Russian people even angrier. So Putin started another war, this time in Syria.\n\nThe problem the world now faces is that Putin has effectively backed himself into a corner. Unlike any normal world leader, he cannot gracefully retire \u2014 he would lose his money, face imprisonment, or even be killed by his enemies. Therefore, what started out as a profit-maximizing endeavor for Putin has transformed into an exercise in world domination to ensure his survival.\n\nTwenty-five years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the West still faces a menacing threat from the Kremlin. It is now driven by kleptocracy rather than communist ideology. But it is still the same menace, with the same nuclear weapons, and an extremely dangerous attitude.\n\nThe real tragedy is that if Western governments hadn\u2019t tolerated Russian kleptocracy over the last quarter century, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today. But as long as Putin and his cronies continue to keep their money safe in Western banks, there is still leverage: Assets can be frozen, and accounts can be refused. If one lesson is to be taken from the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is that we in the West cannot continue to keep our heads in the sand and ignore kleptocracy in Russia, because the consequences are disastrous. RETURN TO LIST.\n\nDmitri Trenin is the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center and served in the Soviet and Russian armed forces from 1972 to 1993. His latest book is Should We Fear Russia?.\n\nThe Soviet Union saw itself as an ideological power. Moscow believed that communism offered, as the old communist slogan went, a \u201cbright future for all humanity.\u201d Leaders in Moscow were convinced that communism was the right recipe for any country, regardless of history, development, or culture \u2014 and 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet empire, that misplaced logic is still shaping events around the globe.\n\nThe Soviet Union\u2019s first major success in communism promotion came in Mongolia, where Moscow prided itself in shifting the country from feudalism to socialism by the late 1930s. After World War II, in addition to Eastern Europe and East Asia, Soviet-sponsored regimes spread across the globe, from Latin America to East Africa, with nominal success.\n\nBut then came Afghanistan in 1979. Moscow went in first to ensure that leaders in Kabul remained loyal to the Soviet Union, but once it was in, the mission changed to helping the Afghans build a state and society based on the Soviet model, like it did in Mongolia. It was in Afghanistan that the Soviet Union discovered the power of militant Islam and eventually understood that it was so much easier to invade a deeply religious country than to reshape its society. By the time Moscow sent military forces into the country, the Soviet Union had revealed its cardinal weakness: imperial overreach. Moscow was already beginning to struggle to keep in line its allies in Eastern Europe \u2014 and to support dozens of client states across the globe.\n\nDiscontent at home was grossly enhanced by the war in Afghanistan, which was both costly and unnecessary. At the same time, the Soviet economy had run out of steam by the 1980s, with infrastructure crumbling and popular rancor growing. The cost of supporting a long list of satellites and surrogates was sapping the finances of the Soviet Union. Moscow, which had always been wary of borrowing abroad, began to take more and more loans. In the final years of the Soviet Union, its foreign policy was heavily influenced by the constant need to seek more funding from abroad: The pace of domestic liberalization was increased, steps toward the German reunification were taken, and Moscow did not intervene when Eastern Europe pursued its own political course in the 1980s.\n\nThe lessons from this historical episode apply first of all to the Russian Federation, the successor to the Soviet Union. It immediately rejected any state ideology, abandoning not only the global empire but also the lands traditionally seen as Russia\u2019s historical heartland, such as Ukraine. Twenty-five years later, as it seeks to rebuild itself as a global great power, Russia is realizing that founding an empire under a different name is not in the cards. Having entered the war in Syria, Russia has also made it clear from the start that it will not send in its ground forces, lest Syria becomes another Afghanistan.\n\nBut the lessons shouldn\u2019t be limited to the former Soviet space. History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. U.S. interventions in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 developed into massive nation-building projects under the guise of democracy \u2014 at great human and financial cost. Any ideology, not just communist, is a poor guide for foreign policy. Foreign military misadventures result in disappointment at home and loss of prestige abroad. And a growing national debt is a ticking bomb that threatens the very stability of the state.\n\nIn the end, the Soviet Union paid the ultimate price for its imperial hubris. RETURN TO LIST.\n\nNargis Kassenova is an associate professor and director of the Central Asian Studies Center at the Kazakhstan Institute of Management, Economics and Strategic Research in Almaty.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, the five new countries of Central Asia \u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan \u2014 were initially left on the outside looking in. The Belavezha Accords \u2014 the document signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich of Belarus on Dec. 8, 1991, that marked the dissolution of the Soviet Union and created a much looser Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place \u2014 were signed with no input from the Central Asian republics. This process revealed an important truth about relations between the opposite sides of the Soviet empire: The Slavic leaders called the shots, while the Central Asians accepted the consequences.\n\nFor the westward-looking Russia of the early 1990s, Central Asia was a burdensome backwater that it did not mind shedding off. After painful efforts to a keep a single economic space and share a currency, Yeltsin\u2019s government pushed other CIS states out of the ruble zone in 1993. This move was particularly painful for Central Asian states, which were highly dependent on Russian banks for financial transfers to stabilize their battered economies.\n\nAs Russia became less democratic and more nostalgic about Soviet glory in the late 1990s, Moscow began to show interest again in Central Asia. As the Kremlin revived talk of its \u201cprivileged interests\u201d and \u201cspheres of influence,\u201d it sought new ways to establish itself as the center of economic and political activity in Eurasia. Moscow poured new resources into the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a military alliance that contains three of the five Central Asian countries. In 2015, the Eurasian Economic Union, an economic bloc of Armenia, Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan \u2014 widely heralded by Vladimir Putin \u2014 came into effect to more closely bind the former Soviet countries.\n\nThrough its alliances, Moscow continues to behave as a sovereign and not as the first among equals in a union. When the West sanctioned Russia over its interference in Ukraine in 2014, Moscow responded with its own set of retaliatory sanctions against European products. This was done without consulting Belarus or Kazakhstan, the other members of the Eurasian Customs Union, the precursor to the Eurasian Economic Union. Russia also carried out missile attacks from the Caspian Sea to targets in Syria in fall 2015 without taking into account the concerns of its military ally and closest partner Kazakhstan, which was forced to reroute flights on short notice out of the region.\n\nAt the societal level in Russia, there is not much interest or love for Central Asians. Millions of labor migrants from Central Asia work in Russia, sending back money to support the families they left behind. This has grown anti-immigrant and racist sentiments in the country, and some key opposition politicians have even sought to channel it. Mikhail Prokhorov, a billionaire and presidential candidate during Russia\u2019s 2012 elections, condescendingly promised that he would close the border with \u201cMiddle Asia\u201d (the Soviet term referring to Central Asia minus Kazakhstan) and introduce a visa regime with these countries. Alexei Navalny, the charismatic activist planning to run in the 2018 presidential elections, has campaigned in the past on introducing a visa system with Central Asia and the Caucasus. With nationalism on the rise, Central Asians have increasingly become the \u201cother\u201d for Russians.\n\nThis trend should urge Central Asians to keep in mind the lesson of the early 1990s. Without shared identity or a shared dream for the future, it\u2019s impossible to build a political community or have any kind of meaningful economic integration. Central Asian states and societies need to reflect on their past and present dependencies and develop identities that are separate from their Soviet history and attachment to Russia. After 25 years, it\u2019s time for Central Asians to abandon the type of self-victimization typical of colonized people and truly embrace their countries\u2019 independence. RETURN TO LIST.\n\nAlexander Cooley is Director of Columbia University\u2019s Harriman Institute and the Claire Tow of Professor of Political Science at Barnard College in New York. His forthcoming book, co-authored with John Heathershaw, is Dictators without Borders: Power and Money in Central Asia.\n\nThe five new countries of Central Asia \u2014 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan \u2014 emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a forgotten region seemingly cut off from the forces of globalization. Scholars and policymakers came to view Central Asia as isolated, disconnected, and insufficiently integrated into the global economy. The region\u2019s governments became increasingly authoritarian, and economies were left stagnant and unreformed from their Soviet days.\n\nThe Central Asian states, however, were not exactly shielded from globalization. Rather than facilitate the transition from a communist command economy, Central Asia\u2019s relationship with the liberal world system after the collapse of the Soviet Union suggests that globalization actually encouraged capital flight, enshrined corruption, and allowed some of the world\u2019s most brutal dictators to cement their rule.\n\nThis legacy of offshore finance has played out across Central Asia, shortchanging the region\u2019s economies and empowering its autocrats. The region\u2019s elites may not have transitioned their countries to liberal political and economic systems, but they did use state institutions to personally enrich themselves \u2014 relying on anonymous shell companies and offshore bank accounts to camouflage their shady transactions. Although the West chastised these countries for pervasive corruption, it rarely paid attention to the international accountants, lawyers, and external advisors who helped to structure these illicit arrangements.\n\nIn Tajikistan, a small mountainous country north of Afghanistan, political battles have been waged over the Tajik Aluminum Company (Talco), the country\u2019s largest exporter, whose management structure is registered in the British Virgin Islands. Accusations of millions of dollars siphoned off and embezzled overseas, allegedly by President Emomali Rahmon and his relatives, have played out in London, Swiss, and New York courtrooms. Similarly, in Turkmenistan, an investigation by the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness estimated that $2 billion to $3 billion in the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves \u2014 accumulated from the trade of natural gas under Turkmenistan\u2019s first president, Saparmurat Niyazov \u2014 was held by Deutsche Bank in an account that was \u201csolely controlled\u201d by the Turkmen president.\n\nIn oil-rich Kazakhstan, a massive bribery scandal implicated a half-dozen major Western energy companies, including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, over lucrative energy concessions in the 1990s. The accusations alleged the companies funneled some $80 million in bribes to senior Kazakh elites via offshore bank accounts. In 2010, James Giffen, an American middleman and senior advisor to President Nursultan Nazarbayev, pled guilty to one minor violation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after mounting a \u201cpublic authority\u201d defense under which he argued that he acted on behalf of various U.S. government entities, including the CIA, to promote American interests through these opaque deals.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kyrgyzstan, two presidential regimes, both of which were ousted in separate popular uprisings in 2005 and 2010, used the U.S. air base at Manas to enrich themselves and their associates. Although the base was critical to the U.S. military\u2019s campaign in Afghanistan, billions of dollars from lucrative fuel contracts were channeled through mysterious offshore companies registered in Gibraltar. Neighboring Uzbekistan\u2019s economy is generally considered closed, but it, too, was engulfed in an international bribery scandal. Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of the country\u2019s late president, reportedly used a variety of offshore vehicles to structure more than $1 billion in payments and kickbacks from Western telecommunications companies.\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, outside observers have frequently characterized Central Asia as a reclusive part of the world. However, by overlooking how regimes strategically used offshore vehicles, bank accounts, and financial intermediaries, the West has ignored its own complicity in fostering the global networks that supported autocracies in Central Asia and around the former Soviet world. RETURN TO LIST.\n\nMoscow is still sacrificing innovation for state security.\n\nAndrei Soldatov is an investigative journalist and cofounder of Agentura.ru, a Russian information hub on intelligence agencies. He is the co-author of The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia\u2019s Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries.\n\nOn Dec. 6, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law the country\u2019s information security doctrine. The 17-page document outlines the Kremlin\u2019s perception of the threats posed by terrorism, foreign propaganda, and cyber-espionage, before calling for a major change \u2014 the creation of a \u201cnational system of managing the Russian segment of the internet.\u201d The doctrine goes on to suggest that telecommunications and information technology (IT) companies should consult with the security services ahead of introducing new services and products and that the country needs to liquidate the \u201cdependence of domestic industries on foreign information technologies.\u201d\n\nAlthough this might seem like a bold new direction for Russia, it\u2019s actually a remnant of the past \u2014 and a sign that the Kremlin has learned nothing from its Soviet history when it comes to embracing technological change. Like the Soviet Union before it, the Russian government and its security services are aiming to restrict innovation for fear of the social and political upheavals it could bring.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how things were organized in the Soviet Union, where authorities traded technological development for the specter of state security. In our book The Red Web, journalist Irina Borogan and I describe how in June 1975, Yuri Andropov, then-chairman of the KGB, reported to the Central Committee about Jewish \u201crefuseniks\u201d making international phone calls. Andropov\u2019s recommendation was \u201cto suppress the use of international communication channels for transmission abroad of biased and slanderous information.\u201d The measure was adopted and worked to limit the spread of dissent, but as a result, the Soviet Union fell far behind the West.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, accounting for this technological deficit needed a new approach, and Vladimir Bulgak, the minister of communications under former President Boris Yeltsin, was willing to break with the past. Russia desperately needed modern communications, but local industry couldn\u2019t provide the technology. Due to Soviet-era restrictions, the Russian telecommunications industry now lagged behind the West by 20 to 25 years. \u201cWe came to think that our industry would never catch up, and that meant we had to go and buy,\u201d Bulgak told me during an interview.\n\nAnd Moscow did just that. In the span of three years, more than 70 percent of all Russian intercity phone stations were replaced by modern digital ones, made in the West, and Bulgak increased the number of international lines in the country from 2,000 analog ones to 66,000, all of them digital.\n\nBulgak bought equipment from abroad, bypassing old Soviet factories at enormous cost \u2014 many of them were forced to close, leaving thousands of people high and dry. But by 1995, Russia had established a modern, national communications industry. Thriving and profitable internet businesses sprang up in the early 2000s, something that would have been impossible without the lines and stations purchased by Bulgak.\n\nThe infrastructure of the Russian internet was built on Western technology, primarily Cisco, an American conglomerate, because the new national telecoms companies believed that reliability was more important than the origin of the supplier. Putin has not learned this lesson. When Western sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea, Putin called for import substitution to replace foreign products with domestic ones. The new security doctrine cements this idea, saying that \u201cthe level of dependence of the domestic industry from foreign IT\u201d is too high and that this makes Russia dependent on \u201cforeign geopolitical interests.\u201d\n\nBut the country\u2019s industry simply can\u2019t produce all the equipment that is needed, and desperate officials have since turned to China to replace Western technology. And although it\u2019s an open question whether this new doctrine will actually make Russia any safer \u2014 it will surely limit the country\u2019s economic potential.

The leak comes just days before Nebraska officials announce a decision on whether the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, a sister project, can move forward.\n\nIn April 2016, there was a 400-barrel release -- or 16,800 gallons -- with the majority of the oil cleanup completed in two months, Walsh said. About 5,000 barrels of oil spilled Thursday.\n\n\"It is a below-ground pipeline, but some oil has surfaced above ground to the grass,\" Walsh said. \"It will be a few days until they can excavate and get in borings to see if there is groundwater contamination.\"\n\nThere were no initial reports of the oil spill affecting waterways, water systems or wildlife, he said.\n\nThe pipeline was shut down \"within minutes\" of the company discovering an irregularity, TransCanada said Friday. The spill has been controlled, the company said, with no further environmental impacts observed and no threat to public safety.\n\nTransCanada said it was working with state and federal agencies.\n\n\"The safety of the public and environment are our top priorities and we will continue to provide updates as they become available,\" the company said.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring the situation and will provide resources and assistance if needed, a spokesman said.\n\n\"EPA is aware of the spill and is receiving periodic updates from the state of South Dakota, which is overseeing response activity at the spill site,\" he said.\n\nThe Keystone Pipeline system stretches more than 2,600 miles, from Hardisty, Alberta, east into Manitoba and then south to Texas, according to TransCanada. The pipeline transports crude oil from Canada.\n\nThe proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, which would stretch from Hardisty to Steele City, Nebraska, would complete the proposed system by cutting through Montana and South Dakota.\n\nThe sections of pipeline affected stretch from Hardisty to Cushing, Oklahoma, and to Wood River, Illinois, the company said.\n\nThe spill occurred in the same county as part of the Lake Traverse Reservation. The leak location is not on Sioux property, but it is adjacent to it and has historical value, said Dave Flute, tribal chairman for Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe.\n\n\"We want to know how long is it going to take to dig this plume of contaminated soil and how can we be reassured, without a doubt, that it has not and will not seep into the aquifer,\" he said.\n\nFlute, along with the tribal emergency management director and the manager of the tribal office of environmental protection, arrived Friday morning at the staging area of the leak site to meet with representatives from TransCanada. Flute said he was out there to offer assistance and to understand the cause of the leak and the environmental impacts it might pose.\n\n\"We want to find out, was there a crack in the pipe? We don't know. We want to get that information,\" Flute said. \"More importantly, and to stay positive, they did clean up the site, they did contain it.\"\n\nEnvironmental activist group Greenpeace said the spill shows the new pipeline in Nebraska should not be approved.\n\n\"The Nebraska Public Service Commission needs to take a close look at this spill,\" said Rachel Rye Butler of Greenpeace. \"A permit approval allowing Canadian oil company TransCanada to build Keystone XL is a thumbs-up to likely spills in the future.\"\n\nThe approval followed years of intense debate over the pipeline amid hefty opposition from environmental groups, who argued the pipeline supports the extraction of crude oil from oil sands, which pumps about 17% more greenhouse gases than standard crude oil extraction. Environmentalists also opposed the pipeline because it would cut across the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the world's largest underground deposits of fresh water.\n\nTar sands oil is much thicker and stickier than traditional oil, significantly complicating cleanup efforts. The fact it's thicker also means it needs to be combined with other hazardous materials to allow it to be transported in pipelines.\n\nNative American groups have argued the pipeline would cut across their sovereign lands.\n\nTransCanada said Thursday that the section of the Keystone Pipeline that was leaking was isolated within 15 minutes after a drop in pressure was detected.\n\nThat pipeline, which runs through both Dakotas and two other states, drew fierce resistance from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota, the tribe's allies and environmentalists."}, "https://www.goskagit.com/news/man-pleads-not-guilty-in-father-s-stabbing-death/article_479b3b6f-88d4-502d-ae77-ff5f098fb511.html": {"title": "Man pleads not guilty in father's stabbing death", "keywords": ["lane davis", " murder", " skagit county superior court"], "url": "https://www.goskagit.com/news/man-pleads-not-guilty-in-father-s-stabbing-death/article_479b3b6f-88d4-502d-ae77-ff5f098fb511.html", "text": "Your notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\nWhenever Brandon Stone posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items."}, "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/27/boring-company-flamethrower/?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle": {"title": "Elon Musk's Boring Company is selling a flamethrower", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/27/boring-company-flamethrower/?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle", "text": "There are 20,000 on sale.

They should have set up a pop-up bedding and hot chocolate store to tap into extensive market opportunities.\n\nIf the Conservatives had seen the community in Manchester after the bomb, giving lifts home to strangers and looking for relatives, putting people up and looking after them, they\u2019d have said, \u201coh my God, the place is overrun with communism, it\u2019s like North Korea\u201d.\n\nSo we should hand the rights to Costa Coffee to be first at a major incident, that way they can make money out of selling drinks rather than give in to the socialist menace of giving them away.\n\nHere\u2019s a captive clientele, who probably won\u2019t know how much they\u2019re spending as they\u2019re in a state of deep trauma, and we\u2019re restricting business opportunities by handing the operation to volunteers who have no idea how to generate wealth.\n\nSomeone should go on Dragon\u2019s Den to set up a company to help people out after catastrophes, charging \u00a370 to contact panicking relatives and provide a choice of light snacks to calm you down after an explosion, in a van with \u201cWe get there faster when there\u2019s a disaster\u201d on the side.\n\nConfusingly, 40 per cent of Conservative voters are in favour of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal to requisition empty properties, which means we\u2019ve reached an alarming state, in which almost half of Conservatives are Marxists.\n\nConservative garden parties in Surrey will soon raise funds by getting Iain Duncan-Smith to auction a signed photo of Fidel Castro, then they\u2019ll have a vote on whether to hand over the lawn to the peasants.\n\nThe comments about Marxism may have another cause, which is that the Conservatives have no idea what\u2019s just happened. For 35 years the consensus has been that nothing can work unless it\u2019s run by the rules of big business, and no one will vote for anyone who tries to restrict the laws of the free market.\n\nThat law is broken now, so they scream all the old insults against Corbyn and it no longer has an effect. Now the Tories suddenly look helpless, unable to sort out an arrangement with 10 people in the DUP, who they agree with on most things. Luckily Brexit will be with twenty-seven countries, half of which hate us, governing minor issues like what everything costs and where everyone lives, so that should be much easier for them.\n\nTheresa May now looks so bewildered, this weekend the Queen will probably announce, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I\u2019m asking him with the beard to take over.

The Guardian interviewed residents at the modern block in Kensington Row, where some survivors will be housed. One of the property owners, Nick, said: \u201cI\u2019m very sad that people have lost their homes, but there are a lot of people here who have bought flats and will now see the values drop. It will degrade things. And it opens up a can of worms in the housing market.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the spirit, Nick. There\u2019s a proper Conservative, not like these fairweather Tories who abandon their free market principles just because people were scorched in an entirely predictable and avoidable inferno.\n\nWhat a shame that Nick wasn\u2019t around when the firefighters arrived.\n\nInstead of getting in the way with Marxist compassion, Nick could have restored order by yelling: \u201cHow much water are you wasting? I pay for that with my council tax you know, you should charge anyone who you rescue with that ladder, this isn\u2019t the Soviet Union.\u201d\n\nThe only thing to take issue with, is Nick shouldn\u2019t be sad, because if people aren\u2019t clever enough to live in gated communities where the builders are paid to cover the dwellings in materials that don\u2019t flare up at a moment\u2019s notice, they\u2019ve only got themselves to blame.\n\nAnd Nick probably thinks, \u201cSurely these people have a second inflammable tower block in the country, where they could go and stay for a while until the work gets done.\u201d\n\nBecause at least he\u2019s not a Marxist."}, "http://baltimore-art.com/2017/02/11/the-aesthetics-of-the-alt-right/": {"title": "The Aesthetics of the Alt-Right \u2013 Post-Office Arts Journal", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://baltimore-art.com/2017/02/11/the-aesthetics-of-the-alt-right/", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article includes an in-depth inquiry into the online activities of political groups for which misogyny, racism, and anti-semitism become defining features; as such, images and mentions of those topics are found in the text.\n\nFor the greater part of the past year, I\u2019ve been surveying the aesthetic sensibilities of nationalist internet hubs such as Breitbart, /pol, r/the_donald, and similarly affiliated Facebook pages. These communities constitute what journalists and theorists have come to refer to as the alt-right\u2014online neo-fascist groups whose growth mirrors and informs the growing nationalist, nativist sentiment as it is represented in the recent electoral success of the UK Independence Party, the Trump campaign, Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, the French National Front, and Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland Party.\n\nBriefly, before I begin thematizing the aesthetics of the alt-right, it is necessary to outline the definition of fascism that I am using in this essay. Fascism is an amorphous term with a multitude of definitions; the task of defining fascism has been attempted by numerous theorists including Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, Arthur Rosenburg, Wilhelm Reich, and more. One useful definition I have encountered comes from semiotician Umberto Eco, who himself was a child during Mussolini\u2019s fascist regime. In his essay Ur-Fascism, Eco identifies themes and rhetorical habits that underpin fascism (although his interrogation is limited to describing what fascism looks and sounds like, as opposed to the mechanism by which it emerges). Some of the characteristics that I will refer to in my aesthetic survey include:\n\nThe online neo-fascist movement, the alt-right consists of a number of different groups, although certain tenets (all of which align with Eco\u2019s criteria for ur-Fascism) are quite consistent throughout these communities in some form or fashion\u2014a preference for authoritarianism over democracy, scientific racism and misogyny under the palatable term \u201chuman biodiversity,\u201d and suspicion towards what they perceive to be the cultural hegemony of the left as evidenced in the liberal leanings of the mainstream media, the entertainment industry, and academia. Their economic views are difficult to discern, with protectionism, accelerated free market global capitalism, and anarcho-capitalism all being advocated in different communities.\n\nIndexing these movements across a two axis chart (fig. a) is productive for the intents and purposes of this paper; however, what is most interesting to observe is instances in which these communities convene in internet \u201cpublic spaces\u201d (which are not public at all), most notably reddit and 4chan. Their creative propagandic images are disseminated throughout social media and oftentimes matriculate all the way up to the Twitter accounts of political leaders, activists, entertainers, and of course, into our national consciousness. As I will refer to this chart throughout this essay, I would like to clarify its organizational logic. Groups, terms, and individuals are plotted according to their variations on the central tenets of the alt-right\u2019s ideological disposition, namely in regards to Nationalism and Faith.\n\nNationalism in general is a defining characteristic of the alt-right; however, within the nationalist ideology there are degrees of variation, particularly in regard to the status of Jewish people and Israel. Representatives from groups that more closely embody economic nationalism can still be considered mainstream figures since their rhetoric skirts around social issues such as race and religion. On the opposite side, the groups share a nationalist ideology, but the rhetoric takes on a distinctly racialized, often anti-Semitic, tone\u2014a stark contrast to the staunchly pro-Israel economic nationalist groups epitomized in the Trump Administration itself.\n\nTowards the bottom of the chart, the religio-philosophical underpinnings of the alt-right contrast. On the left side of the chart are the individuals and movements that place their faith in inegalitarian readings of traditionally recognized religion. Perhaps echoing Julius Evola\u2019s spiritual racism, various communities re-read Christian mysticism, Zen Buddhism, and Hindu polytheism, ultimately and bewilderingly drawing White Supremacist conclusions. On the bottom-right, we see a more technocratic, hypercapitalist neo-fascism that places its faith in markets, accelerated capitalism, and \u201cempirical\u201d science to reveal the truly inegalitarian hierarchy key of racial classification. In a sense, there is a loose historical allegory to be found here: the spiritual quadrant of the alt-right finds coherence in Julius Evola\u2019s spiritual justification for fascism (a concept that was quite appealing to Mussolini), while the techno-determinist quadrant draws influence from Nazist racism, which uses a biological justification. Thus, opposite axes should not be understood as antithetical; the axes are constitutive and relational, accounting for variations in nationalism and faith.\n\nThe faction of the alt-right that I\u2019ve labeled as \u201ceconomic nationalist\u201d (fig. b) is the most recognizable aspect of the alt-right; it can be argued that they now occupy the executive branch of the United States government. At the very least, they (via the appointment of Breitbart News executive chair Steve Bannon as Trump\u2019s new strategist) occupy the position of the President-Elect\u2019s right-hand man. Beyond Bannon and Trump, self-identified major contributors of the public alt-right include Breitbart, its tech editor Milo Yiannopolous, and international populist movements such as the National Front. These movements, figures, and publications have found a receptive audience in a number of online communities that are defined by gamer culture and what has been in the past referred to as the Manosphere. Almost exactly as it sounds, the Manosphere refers to a loose affiliation of anti-feminist men\u2019s rights groups across the internet, including the subreddits r/theredpill, r/mgtow and forums such as bodybuilding.com and a variety of smaller blogs. The Manosphere also focuses on pickup artistry (PUA) or seduction training, which attempts to pathologize female personality types and empirically develop strategies to seduce them. One popular figure in the Manosphere is social media personality Mike Cernovich, who was recently profiled in a New Yorker article entitled Trolls for Trump. Cernovich is the author of The Gorilla Mentality, which epitomizes the interests of \u201cthe mansophere,\u201d including gender essentialism, pickup artistry, \u201calpha-male\u201d culture, rape apologetics, anti-feminism, and being redpilled.\n\nThis image (fig. c) is pulled from the Facebook meme page Edgy Memes and Fashy Dreams. In it, we see a number of racist and fascist tropes\u2014the depiction of the animalistic black male figure pursuing a white woman epitomizes the basic dynamic of world depiction in many fascist movements. The other is presented as both a subhuman degenerate and an existential threat; in Eco\u2019s words, he is \u201cat the same time too strong and too weak.\u201d Alluding to the overlap between the manosphere and the gaming community, signifiers of virtuality\u2014the game-packaging design, the logo, and the title Europe Simulator 2016\u2014place faith in the computer simulation in accurately modeling a current state of affairs. Note that there is nobody to identify with in this depiction; we are certainly not the foreigner and, since we are entering from a fundamentally male space, we are not the victim. It is only possible for us to identify as the simulation itself. This is a motif that, as I will describe throughout this essay, is highly desirable for the alt-right. Ultimately, this religious faith in technology to make sense of and organize the world reflects the alt-right\u2019s faith that science will undermine the propagandic, false ideology of racial egalitarianism, revealing that people of color truly are, empirically, beasts to be subjugated, rejected, or annihilated.\n\nThe overtly sexual-political fantasy here cannot be ignored of course; after all, a key rhetorical strategy against immigration has been to pigeonhole the immigrant as a rapist, drawing from admittedly real and troubling events such as the New Years 2016 Cologne sexual assaults. Trump\u2019s comments that labeled Mexicans as rapists during his campaign serve a similar role to these fear-mongering tactics. However, we find a contradiction in the perceived threat of rape, since the Manosphere tends to engage in rape-apologetics and victim-blaming. Thus, we can postulate that in this image, the alt-right and its Manosphere constituency does not take issue with rape itself (which is not to say, of course, that rape and its depictions are not of great importance and concern), but that the rapist is black. This fear and revulsion at the prospect of a black man having sex with a white woman has been analyzed by a number of prominent figures that precede my discussion, most notoriously by Frantz Fanon and in a more autobiographical manner by Malcolm X. Furthermore, it is not difficult to associate this image with the full-page ad taken out by Donald Trump calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of black and latino youths that were accused of sexually assaulting a white female runner. Years later, DNA evidence revealed that the youths were not in fact guilty; however, Trump adamantly refused to change his stance.\n\nThe alt-right\u2019s perception of the black-male as a sexual threat is further reinforced by the alt-right\u2019s insult of choice, cuck, used in a manner similar to the word faggot\u2014a weak, \u201cbeta,\u201d or emasculated man (fig. d). This word has matriculated into mainstream political discourse, with the term cuckservative referring to a conservative who is willing to work across the aisle or moderate his position on a hardline issue, nominally immigration. Returning to the racial question, it is imperative to note that the term cuck has a distinctly racial dimension\u2014the word refers to cuckoldry, a genre of porn in which white men with white wives invite black men over to have sex with their wives while they watch (fig. e).\n\nThe reactionary vision of futurity that the Europe Simulator image (fig. c) describes is depicted as what will happen if immigration policy is dictated by the liberal left\u2014as exemplified by the German Christian Democrats iconography and the EU flag presented at the bottom of the packaging. Although the visual language of this image is defined by European geopolitics, as I have described, anti-immigrant rhetoric tends to evoke the same visual tropes. Thus, it is unsurprising when the God-Emperor himself, Donald Trump (fig. f), is presented as the protector of the sanctity of idealized white women against the primal hordes of ethnic Others. Depictions of Trump evoke a sun-swept Manichaean battlefield; the gilded Greco-Roman architecture in the distance evokes Mussolini\u2019s promise of a New Roman Empire or the taste of Hitler\u2019s \u201cGreat German Art Exhibition.\u201d It is not difficult to make the leap to these classical fascist aesthetics from Trump\u2019s own personal taste, which is similarly gilded and gaudy. The cult of masculinity in the images is self-evident (even in the images in which Marine Le-Pen is the protagonist, she is deliberately rendered androgynous). The aesthetics of war and technology have been updated for the youthful tastes of the alt-right\u2014we see references to the role-playing game Warhammer, the Pepe the Frog meme, transhuman aesthetics via films such as The Matrix and Blade Runner, Dragonball Z, and videogames such as Counter Strike, all of which reflect newer notions of futuristic warfare. Again, the overtly racial narratives are hard to miss with certain memes reappropriating images of the first Crusade. \u201cDeus Vult\u201d\u2014the rallying cry of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre\u2014is copied-and-pasted into the comments incessantly (fig. g).\n\nThe futuristic gilded war-machine will presumably defend against the black rapist, the Syrian terrorist, the Chinese bureaucrat, and the Jewish cultural Marxist; however, just as investments into technological development during the cold war resulted in innovation outside the realm of defense, to the alt-right, the same mechanism that produces this gilded war-machine will also take us to the moon and beyond. The image of astronauts wearing red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d Trump hats with Newt Gingrich (also wearing a Trump hat) in the distance is a direct reference to Gingrich\u2019s 2012 campaign promise to colonize the moon (seriously) (fig. h). Here, we see the expansionist rhetoric of neo-fascism; just as science will liberate us from political correctness, it will also take us beyond our earthly confines. This notion of space colonialism is reflected in the music of one alt-right tastemaker, Galactic Lebensraum or CYBERNAZI, who fuses vaporwave and fascist aesthetics, providing a soundtrack for the future digital space reich. There is an emphasis on the infinite in these images as well, perhaps national expansionism with a corporate logic of unlimited growth. This reflects Trump\u2019s own business history of course; in The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt describes how expansionism, as a political doctrine, borrows directly from the private sector. Thus, Trump\u2019s experience as a business magnate (or at least, a symbol of a business magnate) allows the neo-fascist imagination to run wild with expansionist fantasies.\n\nThe extent of mechanization goes even further than the colonization of outer space. Ultimately, the aesthetics of the alt-right betray an expectation that the subject himself will transcend his human form thereby liberating himself from sexual agony and ambiguity. The images certainly have suicidal implications\u2014one image (fig. i) in which the viewer looks upon Trump and can comprehend emotions only as numbers embodies a sort of violence of self that occurs as the subject attempts to transcend his humanly state. The reasons for this mechanized suicide are manifold\u2014one could point to a normalization of high suicide rates of white males in middle America or a latent self-awareness of the consequences of a Trump presidency on the environment. These propagandic images embody multiple manifestations of representation-as-violence\u2014sexual, epistemic, racial, physical, and self-inflicted. When Susan Sontag writes on Leni Riefenstahl, she describes fascism as unmistakably creating a cult of death; the aesthetics of neo-fascism reaffirm that claim.\n\nThere is, of course an explicitly fascistic portion of the alt-right (fig. j): the literal neo-Nazis, white supremacists, who will readily admit to identifying as such. Most of the images that I will survey come from the digital publication The Daily Stormer, which is a contemporaneous reboot of the Nazi publication The Stormer. Pictured below is the front page of one issue of The Stormer (fig. k) with the headline \u201cdie juden sind unser ungl\u00fcck\u201d\u2014the Jews are our misfortune. Additional content comes from the alt-right subreddit and the web publication The Right Stuff, which hosts two podcasts, one entitled Fash the Nation and another called The Daily Shoah (shoah refers to the Hebrew word for the Holocaust).\n\nAlso considered within this category (although there is less of a visual culture to these organizations) are two institutions that have received significant media attention recently: the National Policy Institute, headed by Richard Spencer whose recent DC rally was documented by the Atlantic, and American Renaissance, a magazine founded and edited by Jared Taylor, a former Harvard University Japanese professor turned white nationalist.\n\nMost of the imagery circulated within these communities consists of direct allusions to Nazi propaganda (and is thus less creative and less interesting); however, since German fascism did include a sort of technocratic idealism, these newer images have been updated. One thread on the Daily Stormer is particularly illustrative of the aesthetic taste of these neo-Nazi communities (fig. l); 80s comics and sci-fi content offer normative gender roles, hyper-masculine futurist heroes, hypersexualized women, and a variety of visions of humans transcending their bodily limits via technological innovation.\n\nIn an animated gif (fig. m), the viewer is situated in the audience of the Nazi Red Skull from the second Captain America film. The Nazi soldiers (which the viewer initially assumes the perspective of and therefore identifies with) themselves resemble mechanical automatons\u2014another instance of the viewer being articulated as a cyborg, further betraying a self-awareness that the members of the alt-right themselves might be harmed under the political conditions they seek to realize. This image is notable for its use of the \u201cecho brackets\u201d\u2014triple parentheses which are used by many sections of the alt-right in order to designate someone of Jewish descent in larger paragraphs of text\u2014that act as a digital gold star (fig. n). One member actually created a browser extension for the web-browser Google Chrome that inserts echo brackets around any individual of Jewish descent. The goal of echo brackets is to bring attention to the omnipotence of Jewish people within different media organizations, affirming the conspiracy theory of the cultural hegemony of Jewish people. In addition to being derived from the fascist hostility towards critical paradigms, echo brackets also evoke the Paleoconservative Pat Buchanan\u2019s (also an idolized figure by the alt-right as the \u201cprevious cultural candidate for president\u201d) conspiracy theory of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d which can be understood to be dog-whistle anti-semitism directed towards criticism descended from the Frankfurt School (and other ideologies which might take the form of linguistic redefinition, political correctness, and identity politics).\n\nThis image (fig. o) references popular circulated images of the electoral map which circulated after the Trump victory, highlighting how the Electoral College was split along race and gender lines. This image takes that logic of identity politics (it can be argued that the alt-right in general represents the strategies of progressive identity politics appropriated by white conservatives) and uses it to reinscribe the notion that multiculturalism and tolerance are holding the human race back from achieving its scientific potential. The idea that fulfilling its scientific potential is the responsibility of the human race is virtually axiomatic to the intellectual faction of the alt-right, but can also be identified as the opinion of more mainstream cultural figures including Francis Fukuyama, Elon Musk, and Peter Thiel; this image describes how quickly that logic can lead to white supremacy.\n\nThese memes (fig. p) are from a Facebook page called \u201cCounter-Signal Memes for Fashy Goys,\u201d with \u201cgoys\u201d being short for goyem, the term for a man who is not of Jewish descent, and fashy being internet slang for both fascism and fashionable, perhaps unintentionally evoking Mussolini\u2019s 1919 Naples speech in which he remarked on how \u201cfascism brings back \u2018style\u2019 in people\u2019s lives.\u201d Here we see caricatures of Leftists; their \u201chashtag activism\u201d is ridiculed and their identity politics are exposed as both hollow and convoluted. Given the connotation of identity politics with \u201ccultural marxism\u201d among the alt-right, it is unsurprising that aesthetic strategies used by fascists to caricature Jews (most notably exaggeratedly crooked teeth and large noses) are projected and conflated with stereotypes of the Left in general\u2014the figures have dyed hair, piercings, buzzed haircuts, don\u2019t wear bras, etc. This smug liberal trope is an exaggerated version of a stereotype invoked by conservatives quite often\u2014it was certainly levied against Kerry, Gore, and Clinton. In a sense, the vast Jewish conspiracy and its somewhat more palatable cousin of \u201cthe cathedral\u201d (as articulated by alt-right intellectual Curtis Yarvin) is not dissimilar from mainstream Trumpian rhetoric that brands the \u201cWashington Establishment\u201d as \u201cthe swamp.\u201d Here we see a direct opposition to critical thought itself, to any gestures that create questions instead of answering them, that complicate instead of reduce. This can be understood as the alt-right follower turning away from what Freud might call the dark continent (both the racial and gendered uses of the term are prescient here); the fact that he can never know or comprehend the experience of the Other renders her an ontological void whose unknowability is too agonizing, thus he finds refuge in representation and, as this image describes, parody.\n\nIn a sense, an aesthetic analysis of the alt-right becomes more challenging when we attempt to approach its intellectual underpinnings, represented in the bottom two quadrants in fig. q. Although they obviously use visuals to supplement their blog posts, manifestos, e-books, etc., these intellectual factions do not use memes as their chief propagandic tool; rather, they write texts that aim to direct, discern, and laud the chaotic accumulation of the images that I have been referring to. However, this does not mean that the texts cannot be interrogated or thematized in a similar manner, but rather that more context and specificity is necessary, since there is a less rich visual language. Because both the accelerationist and the spiritual factions of the alt-right have their own sprawling associative canons, I would like to first contrast these two intellectual factions using a framework outlined by the Italian proto-Fascist philosopher Julius Evola. After that, I would like to focus on a mutual fascination for East and South Asia among these intellectual factions ultimately characterizing how they articulate different inegalitarian visions of futurity using Asia as both a historical inspiration and an empty container onto which this vision can be projected.\n\nJulius Evola can be considered an ideological predecessor to the spiritual faction of the alt-right. Just as he was read and admired by Mussolini and printed in Nazi publications, alt-right blogs write about Evola admiringly. Additionally, Steve Bannon has presented at least a tertiary knowledge of Evola\u2019s thought. An actual interrogation of Evola\u2019s thought would be too significant a vagary from the general task of this paper; I am simply interested in invoking Evola\u2019s distinction between two different kinds of racial inegalitarian philosophy in order to provide a helpful allegory for the difference between the spiritual and the accelerationist factions of the alt-right. In his text, The Social and Political Thought of Julius Evola, Cardiff historian Paul Furlong describes how to Evola, \u201crace is an expression of [a supernatural] hierarchy. It is therefore seen as a vector of the divine impulse, a form of human commonality that combines both biological and spiritual characteristics \u2026 Evola seemed not to deny biological racism but to seek to relegate it to a minor explanatory role.\u201d Furlong emphasizes that Evola does not base his racism in a belief in an empirical biological hierarchy in order to contrast Evola\u2019s racism with that of Nazism, which relied immensely on scientific justifications. Ultimately, these two different justifications for racism between Evola and the Nazis serve as a potent allegory for the difference between the spiritual and the accelerationist factions of the alt-right intelligentsia; the former relies on religious, emotive, mythical tropes (both sourced from the past or created organically) while the latter relies on machines, logic, and science. I will begin by examining the aesthetics of the spiritual faction; in a sense, I regard the spiritual faction as having more rhetorical coherence with the Trump campaign since Trump is more of a neo-Luddite who grounds his racism in cultural arguments, as opposed to scientific ones.\n\nThis image (fig. r) is from an article entitled Esoteric Kekism, or Kek as a Bodhisattva of Racial Enlightenment on the alt-right blog Atlantic Centurion. Atlantic Centurion is the blog of Lawrence Murray. In jargon-filled posts with eclectic titles including Proverbs of a Xenoskeptic Ethno-Nationalist, Murray blends political philosophy, a didactic narrative of the present, new media theory, and religious mythology into a bizarre brand of cultural criticism. In this article, Murray takes the alt-right\u2019s favorite activity of rapidly accumulating political memes and drafts an understanding of that activity as a sort of religious ritual that can be concretized in images and text. Referring to the already notorious Pepe the Frog meme, Murray asserts that the alt-right has a central deity god, Kek, whose name is derived from a bastardized type-input error of the term \u201clol\u201d; the letters l and o are next to k and i on the keyboard; the mistyped kik becomes kek through an assimilation of the phonetic form of the typo. Kek is a chaos god whose magical abilities, referred to as meme magic, can be invoked through distributing memes. Through Kek, whatever desire is expressed in the meme\u2014for Trump to be elected, for the UK to vote leave, for WikiLeaks to release more emails, etc.\u2014becomes reality. The alt-right meme warrior praises his/her god with the ubiquitous phrase \u201cPraise Kek\u201d. A number of theorists have written about Kek, with the most effective piece being Tara Isabella Burton\u2019s essay Apocalypse Whatever, in which Burton remarks \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether Kek is \u2018really\u2019 a chaos god. He might as well be. Likewise, meme magic, to the extent that that it serves as a record of cultural engagement, is real too.\u201d Thus, debating whether or not esoteric kekism should be regarded as a legitimate religion is beside the point; in my aesthetic analysis, I am more interested in why Murray invokes Buddhism as the model for his creative endeavor.\n\nIn fig. r, we see the repeated motif of Pepe the Frog operating as monks in a Nazi/Buddhist temple. An undead or cyborg-esque SS general is seen in the seated lotus position, in front of three different Buddhist figures, who are in turn all situated in front of a giant shrine to Hitler. The image is notably devoid of color in order to aid the assimilation of the Eastern imagery with its white supremacist implications; color constitutes difference, the desaturation operates as a visual reflection of Murray\u2019s opening assertion that the Buddha was, in fact, white. This kind of historical re-reading is not a new invention; Murray\u2019s whitewashing of Buddhism has historical parallels in the Nazi occultist Maximine Portaz (pseudonymously known as Savitri Devi) who sought to synthesize Nazism with Hinduism (Murray also begins his essay with a reference to Portaz) and in Evola\u2019s fascism which drew heavily from Hindu scripture. Ultimately, the whitewashing and appropriation of Buddhist imagery allows the alt-right to reconcile cultural accomplishments by racial Others with its own ethno-nationalist conviction. It also gives the alt-right a transgressive, exhilarating quality\u2014something that, as Milo Yiannopoulos wrote in his Establishment Conservative\u2019s Guide to the Alt-Right, the alt-right prides itself on.\n\nOf course, on a more rudimentary level, East Asian aesthetics appeal to the tastes of the demography of the alt-right\u2014internet culture and its large constituency of young white male millennials have been fascinated with anime and cyberpunk long before the alt-right existed in its contemporaneous form. In the previous image also pulled from Atlantic Centurion, we see an image of a younger Trump flanked by light-skinned anime girls wearing Make America Great Again caps. Here (fig. s), just as rereading the Buddha as an Aryan religious icon became a rhetorical strategy to contextualise reblogging and reposting memes as a religious activity, a sign that lay audiences might associate with Asian (in this case, Japanese) culture actually functions as an endorsement of white supremacy. One attribute of the girls in this image that might not strike the viewer as unorthodox is the figures\u2019 large eyes, which are obviously cartoonishly exaggerated and frankly made to look more European. This is not how anime eyes always looked, as explained in media theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun\u2019s text Control and Freedom. Chun cites Mary Grigsby, who recounts how \u201cbefore the Japanese came into contact with Westerners they drew themselves with Asian features. After contact with the West, particularly after World War II and the subsequent reconstruction of Japan under the domination of the United States, they began to depict characteristics that are supposed to be Japanese with Western idealized physical characteristics: round eyes, blonde, red or brown hair, long legs and thin bodies.\u201d Thus, we see something that should be contradictory\u2014the representation of a non-European art form should be regarded as degenerate by the alt-right, but it actually becomes a Eurocentric statement; the Westernization of the anime girl is appealing to the alt-right viewer because it represents the perceived successes of Imperial domination, to the extent that a foreign adversary ends up taking care of the whitewashing itself.\n\nThe spiritual faction of the alt-right engages in practices of religious reappropriation and the construction of a new kind of spirituality based in the language and activity of the digital. On the other hand, the technological-determinist faction of the alt-right intelligentsia embodied in what can be understood as an ideological predecessor to the right, the Neoreactionaries instead place their faith in accelerated capitalism, technological innovation, and transhumanism. Pseudonymous cultural critic Josephine Armistead has outlined key tenets of Neoreactionism in her essay The Silicon Ideology; many of these tenets cohere with images I\u2019ve already shown, including a faith in transhumanism, a preference for authoritarianism under a tech CEO or a super-intelligent AI, and essentialist inegalitarian attitudes towards race and gender under the more palatable term \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d. Today, Neoreactionism has a contentious relationship with the rapidly radicalizing alt-right; however, while its well-known voices have distanced themselves, the ideas that Neoreactionism espouses are pervasive across the alt-right and in popular political discourse in certain parts of the country, most notably in Silicon Valley.\n\nA key intellectual forefather of Neoreactionism is Curtis Yarvin who between 2007 and 2014, under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug, laid the groundwork for Neoreactionism on his blog, Unqualified Reservations. Yarvin takes aim at democracy and egalitarianism, but his most enduring contribution has been defining and repeatedly levying verbal indictments at what he refers to as the Cathedral\u2014the combination of the University system, mainstream media outlets, and state legislatures which Yarvin regards as oppressive, stultifying, and indoctrinating.\n\nA more recognizable name in Neoreactionism is Nick Land, a media theorist, philosopher, and aesthetician previously affiliated with the University of Warwick. Nick Land is typically recognized for his advocacy for accelerationism\u2014the notion that we should accelerate the development of capitalism. Accelerationism has advocates across the political spectrum; for the Left, accelerationism is appealing so that we can reveal the flaws of capitalism and bring about its end; for the Right, accelerationism is appealing to the extent that we can further reap the financial and lifestyle benefits of capitalism\u2019s innovative capacities. Landian accelerationism is defined by an awareness that capitalism atomizes bodies, subjugates certain populations, and ultimately dissolves the domain of the social. For Nick Land, however, this is not a negative; he regards the creative capacity of capitalism entirely redeeming of its consequences on the body. Land believes that we should accelerate capitalism as we know it in order to unleash \u201cthanatropic machinism\u201d (here we again encounter the cult of death) which he defines as a collective productive engine that will emerge once man liberates himself from correlationalist (or anthropocentric) egalitarian models of society and subjectivity. To Land, we will, ultimately submit to the authority of Number which is not simply a quantitative unit or arithmetic concept but rather a dynamic scalable architecture that is alluded to by object-oriented programming languages, artificial intelligence, electronic music, and video games.\n\nWhile the spiritual faction of the alt-right reappropriates East Asian texts (either religio-historical in the Buddha-as-white-nationalist-Avatar or pop cultural as with the Anime Trump meme) for the accelerationist Neoreactionaries, East Asia has a radically different function. Instead of serving as a site for historical excavation and reconsideration, Neoreactionism regards East Asia as a site of futurity\u2014either an actual model to be emulated, or a sort of field onto which hypercapitalist totalitarian fantasies can be imposed.\n\nThis image (fig. u) is not a juxtaposition of picture and text like the previous highlighted images\u2014it\u2019s a photograph of the Singaporean authoritarian leader Lee Kuan Yew. This image comes from an obituary post on Nick Land\u2019s blog Outside In after Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015. The post is titled \u201cGreatness\u201d, and it praises Lee Kuan Yew for being a Neoreactionary before anybody knew what that term actually was. Land chooses to highlight how Kuan Yew refashioned the Singaporean state based on a model of widespread privatization. Land\u2019s assertion that Kuan Yew is the most influential leader of the 20th century echoes a sentiment expressed by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek in his text First as Tragedy, Then as Farce. \u017di\u017eek quotes philosopher Peter Sloterdijk who also makes the assertion that Kuan Yew will be remembered as the most influential figure of the 20th century. \u017di\u017eek continues to elaborate on Kuan Yew\u2019s influence, attributing to him a living, compelling example that capitalism and liberal democracy do not necessarily require each other but might actually be antagonistic toward each other, and that capitalism might function better under authoritarianism.\n\nI choose to link \u017di\u017eek\u2019s pairing of Capitalism to \u201cAsian Values\u201d with Land\u2019s admiration for Lee Kuan Yew because they both embody a kind of techno-Orientalist idealization of the Far East as a testing ground or prototypical society where we can observe what transpires when the embodiment of capital itself becomes the organizing mechanism of state power. Furthermore, if we take the transhuman aesthetics that underscore much of Land\u2019s thought (particularly through his analysis of William Gibson and EDM), the Neoreactionist vision of society includes a relegation of the social and the physical body to capital. Thus, I return to an image (fig. v) that was not pulled directly from a Neoreactionary blog (it was found in a recent Vice article about an alt-right EDM movement called fashwave), but that I believe represents the endurance of Landian accelerationist techno-Orientalist fantasies of authoritarian capitalism. Here, we see a futuristic skyline in which every single building seems to be part of the Trump corporate ecosystem. It\u2019s not that far in the future\u2014perhaps drawing inspiration from the Japanese economic miracle; the image projects a vision of growth that is exponential as opposed to incremental. The skyline operates as a Western caricature of East Asian futurity\u2014it resembles either Shanghai or Tokyo\u2014but, the repeated pyramid is familiar sign of a hierarchical, totalitarian order. Furthermore, the fact that the new galactic emperor appears to be Trump\u2019s son, Barron, implies that this future state does not hold democratic elections but, instead, relies on a dynastic monarchic transition of power.\n\nFew other buildings are labeled at all; however, it is possible to make out two other building signs. One is a cocktail bar, presumably an expansion of Trump\u2019s Las Vegas and Atlantic City casino properties. The other is an arcade which, at a glance, is a nod to the gamer demography of the alt-right. However, just as images like this seem to betray a fundamental understanding of the ecological crisis (to the extent that this image is also immensely hazy) it also betrays a totalizing melancholy that the alt-right constituent either tacitly enjoys or isn\u2019t willing to overtly disclose. After all, if this utopian vision is so grand, why is the escapism of a giant institutional arcade necessary? Surely, in this fantasy the enjoyment found in video games could be found in everyday life. The fact that in a projected techno-utopian ethnostate there is an increased need for escape reveals that this vision is not one of emancipation but one of a glitzy self-indulgent annihilation. As the urban development continues to accelerate, the imperative to evaporate into an invented world becomes stronger. Thus, we see the tragedy of the alt-right\u2014it has no legible end; even when it tries to articulate a vision for the future, it relies on recycled 80s tropes and ultimately looks more or less like a barbaric version of status quo: corporate rule coupled with an alienated, atomized public.\n\nIn attempting to theorize German fascism, Walter Benjamin wrote that at the heart of fascism is a revolutionary impulse; however, this impulse, when devoid of class consciousness, becomes animalistic and libidinal, an urge that lashes out without fundamentally targeting or changing the economic status quo. Within the new fascism we are currently witnessing, the revolt is not against capitalism itself but against capitalism\u2019s brand\u2014namely globalism, multiculturalism, and cosmopolitanism. Unable to liberate themselves from the fundamental religion of capitalism, neo-fascists actually double down on its perceived graces, namely that of technological innovation. The ultimate repudiation of what Zizek calls ethical capitalism (think of a Hillary Clinton campaign ad\u2014capitalism with a multicultural face or environmentally conscious, recyclable, brown exterior) takes the form of a new penchant for imperialism, colonialism, and environmental destruction. Ultimately, this newfound (currently largely performative) indulgence coheres quite efficiently with the classic fascist fetishization of war and finds itself temporally prescient in responding to the current migrant crisis that has brought Europe to its knees.\n\nWe also have something quite powerful in terms of critical paradigms insofar as these images betray their own delusion, insecurity, or ideological context. To decode them is the first step in fighting back, presumably; it is a far more effective option than simply generalizing or digging one\u2019s head further into the sand. Furthermore, thematizing neo-fascism empowers the individual to identify what Deleuze and Guattari might call microfascisms\u2014fascistic tendencies on a small scale which are pernicious throughout everyday life or, in the case of Adorno, personality types that are predisposed towards authoritarianism. Boris Buden, in his recent op-ed for e-flux titled \u201cContemporary Fascism and the Limits of Historical Analogy\u201d, concludes by asserting that \u201cdrawing analogies between contemporary fascism and historical fascism is far from our worst analytic tool for confronting the dangers of today\u2019s crisis-ridden global capitalism. So we might as well make productive use of it, but only insofar as we have another tool at hand\u2014a knife.\u201d Buden is not wrong that criticism, analogy, and metaphor are insufficient tools for combating neo-fascism; however the aesthetic nature of contemporary fascism is, in a sense, an undeniable affirmation of the power of propagandic images in today\u2019s visual culture. The right has outpaced the left in terms of how deftly they have used these images and have thus built a coalition of large swaths of voters in the US and Europe. Thus, the knife is probably not the best tool either; the most optimal tool for combatting neo-fascism is the image, the algorithmic sorting mechanism, and the narrative, all of which can be employed as a means of redirecting society from performances towards politics."}, "https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/744/text": {"title": "Text - H.R.744 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Truth in Employment Act of 2017", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/744/text", "text": "Placed on calendar as privileged nomination Placed on calendar with footnote"}, "http://m.mysanantonio.com/news/us-world/article/Senior-Associate-Justice-Antonin-Scalia-found-6828930.php": {"title": "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia found dead at West Texas ranch", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://m.mysanantonio.com/news/us-world/article/Senior-Associate-Justice-Antonin-Scalia-found-6828930.php", "text": ""}, "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/the-democrats-deadly-error": {"title": "The Democrats' Deadly Error", "keywords": ["Presidential Election of 2016", "Clinton", " Hillary Rodham", "Trump", " Donald J"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/the-democrats-deadly-error", "text": "In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country,\u201d vowing that they \u201cwill be forgotten no longer.\u201d This essential political idea \u2014 that a vast segment of the nation\u2019s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon \u2014 has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal.\n\nIn 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the \u201cforgotten man\u201d as a reason to rebuild the economy from the \u201cbottom up.\u201d More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the \u201cForgotten American\u201d \u2014 the white \u201clower middle class\u201d voter \u2014 as the key to the nation\u2019s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. \u201cIn the guise of the working class \u2014 or the American yeoman or John Smith \u2014 he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called \u2018the bone and sinew of the country,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Schrag wrote. \u201cNow he is \u2018the forgotten man,\u2019 perhaps the most alienated person in America.\u201d\n\nThat this \u201cforgotten\u201d American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people \u2014 most notably, to African-Americans \u2014 at the expense of the white working class. It is no coincidence that the \u201cforgotten men and women of our country\u201d began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country.\n\nThe Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term \u201cforgotten man.\u201d Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner\u2019s most famous political essay, \u201cWhat the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,\u201d rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner\u2019s view. And his \u201cforgotten man\u201d owed the least of all.\n\nIn his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. \u201cThese unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,\u201d he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans \u201cthat build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.\u201d\n\nTo Roosevelt, the \u201cforgotten man\u201d encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer \u2014 ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation.\n\nBut the New Deal also \u201cforgot\u201d \u2014 or excluded \u2014 many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to \u201cremember\u201d its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the \u201cforgotten American\u201d began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. \u201cThere is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,\u201d Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, \u201cThe Forgotten American.\u201d \u201cJust names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for \u201claw and order,\u201d a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the \u201csilent majority\u201d \u2014 and the \u201cforgotten American.\u201d And though he included \u201cmen and women\u201d in his victory speech, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the \u201cforgotten\u201d white working-class man.\n\nRace, too, remains an indelible part of today\u2019s conversation about who has been \u201cforgotten\u201d and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cforgotten man\u201d for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor.\n\nWith Mr. Trump\u2019s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.\n\nBeverly Gage is a professor of history at Yale."}, "http://mtstandard.com/news/local/insulin-price-spike-leaves-diabetes-patients-in-crisis/article_74cd6b23-7d9d-5f36-9df0-9c72c5de9f1a.html": {"title": "Insulin price spike leaves diabetes patients in crisis", "keywords": ["", " diabetes", " insulin", " st. vincent healthcare", " university of washington", " endocrinology", " american diabetes association", " providence medical group", " charles r. drew university of medicine and science", " chestnut hill hospital", " price gouging", " eli lilly", " express scripts", " langone medical center", " novo nordisk", " sanofi", " butte news", " butte montana", " commerce", " medicine", " pharmacology", " anatomy", " patient", " genetics", " hospital", " economics", " drug", " manager", " company", " irl hirsch", " price"], "url": "http://mtstandard.com/news/local/insulin-price-spike-leaves-diabetes-patients-in-crisis/article_74cd6b23-7d9d-5f36-9df0-9c72c5de9f1a.html", "text": "Ida Reighard of Butte, a registered nurse, has worked 17 years with diabetes patients and in diabetes education.

But for the past few weeks, work consisted of putting on a lot of makeup and meeting men for coffee dates.\n\nMy pseudonym was April Lim. I posed as a young woman looking for a place to stay in Vancouver\u2019s hot housing market. The men I met up with were offering just that \u2013 but at a price.\n\nIn simple terms, it\u2019s prostitution. These men are asking women to have sex with them in exchange for rent.\n\nAds have been popping up on Craigslist, some with careful wording suggesting that a discreet deal could be made if you\u2019re the right candidate. Others were more blatant, asking for \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d or a \u201csexy slut.\u201d It seems the men behind these ads have found a new way to get Vancouver\u2019s expensive housing market to work for them.\n\nThe first man we met with was from Croatia. He\u2019s waiting for his permanent residency in Canada, and lives in a basement suite in Burnaby. He explained that he hadn\u2019t been successful in relationships and that he was looking to try something new.\n\nHe treated the rendez-vous almost like a first date, asking about my background, my family and what my hobbies were. He seemed nervous, and said his mother was waiting for him in the Metrotown mall. I almost felt sorry for the guy \u2013 until I realized I shouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe reality of the situation remains: this man was setting himself up in a power position to prey on women. When the exchange of goods stops, he\u2019ll want money \u2013 or kick the woman out onto the street. I met with Janine Benedet, a law professor at the University of British Columbia, who explained it very clearly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all men who are overtly violent or discriminatory,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean even the confused ones, even the ones who want to set themselves as unlucky in love aren\u2019t engaging in behaviour that\u2019s exploitative and predatory.\u201d\n\nThat man quickly became explicit and very specific about his sexual needs the next time I was in contact with him over the phone, and suggested that I wear clothing that would be easy to take off on certain scheduled nights. He then asked for rough sex on the couch. I felt even less sorry for him then.\n\nThe second man we met up with owns a place on Burrard Street in downtown Vancouver. He\u2019s from Turkey and works in a restaurant. His ad described the situation as a \u201croom share,\u201d but in the e-mail response he revealed it was actually a \u201cbed-share.\u201d He claimed more than a thousand women emailed him in hopes of staying at his condo. When I asked why he decided to meet up with me, he said it was because I stated in my email that I was \u201copen-minded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask if you\u2019re open minded, none of them says I am open minded,\u201d he said, describing the other candidates. \u201cAnd then [I say] is it possible to share a bed? They say: if I put a small blanket down [on the floor] I can sleep there. So they\u2019re not open minded.\u201d\n\nHe explained that he didn\u2019t want women paying rent because then they would ask for privacy \u2013 and then told me about a previous tenant, whom he had kicked out for that exact reason. She was paying $350 monthly and he decided to ask her to leave in the middle of the month. He wasn\u2019t clear about the entire situation, but told me that she had asked him to be quiet in the mornings. When she threatened to call police for kicking her out, he dared her to do so. She didn\u2019t.\n\nLouisa Russel from Vancouver Rape Relief says women face these kinds of situations too often in Vancouver\u2019s expensive housing market, where vacancy rates are at a record low and competition is fierce. It\u2019s left them desperate, and with not many options.\n\n\u201cWe receive calls from women phoning us complaining about predatory landlords,\u201d she said.\n\nRussel says the sex that\u2019s being exchanged for rent can\u2019t be seen as consensual. She explained that single women in poverty receive $375 per month for shelter from the government \u2013 an amount that wouldn\u2019t get them anything in Metro Vancouver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s under these coerced conditions, these unliveable economic conditions that women are responding to these ads because they\u2019re desperate and they don\u2019t want to be homeless,\u201d Russel said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re responding.\u201d\n\nSo why do these women need to stay in Metro Vancouver? Iglika Ivanova from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives says it\u2019s because most of the jobs that have been created in the past year in B.C. are located there. She also says women earn less than men in this province and more of them live in poverty.\n\n\u201cIt makes them susceptible to abuse,\u201d Ivanova said. \u201cEspecially in Vancouver, the gap is very high.\u201d\n\nThe women I spoke to are all looking for systemic change; whether it\u2019s the local police force to start cracking down on the men behind these ads, or our governments to take steps to ease the housing market.\n\nIn any case a solution has to be found to help women who are turning to these coercive situations because although I get to forget about these men and go home to my family at the end of the day \u2013 many women in B.C. don\u2019t.\n\nWatch CTV News at Six Tuesday for the full investigation from Jon Woodward..."}, "https://newrepublic.com/minutes/138327/stop-ignoring-clintons-left-wing-female-critics": {"title": "Stop ignoring Clinton\u2019s left-wing female critics.", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://newrepublic.com/minutes/138327/stop-ignoring-clintons-left-wing-female-critics", "text": "By March 23, Congress will have to pass a bill to fund the government. In doing so, Republicans and Democrats can reverse the maddening policy that has essentially shut down research on gun violence for the last 22 years.\n\nThis is the easiest, least controversial step Congress can take in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead. Gun control legislation certainly isn\u2019t going anywhere\u2014House Speaker Paul Ryan suggested as much on Thursday morning, when he said Congress needs more information on what would be an effective policy: \u201cI think, as public policymakers, we don\u2019t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.\u201d\n\nBut as things stand now, Congress will never have the facts or the data Ryan claims to need because, as the Washington Post reported in October, \u201cGun-control research in the United States essentially came to a standstill in 1996.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, the Republican-majority Congress threatened to strip funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unless it stopped funding research into firearm injuries and deaths. The National Rifle Association accused the CDC of promoting gun control. As a result, the CDC stopped funding gun-control research \u2014 which had a chilling effect far beyond the agency, drying up money for almost all public health studies of the issue nationwide. \n\n\n\n\u201cIn the area of what works to prevent shootings, we know almost nothing,\u201d Mark Rosenberg, who led the CDC\u2019s gun-violence research in the 1990s, told the Post.\n\nThis policy\u2014known as the Dickey Amendment\u2014should not exist. Even its former champion acknowledged as much. In 2015, two years before his death, Republican Congressman Jay Dickey told HuffPost that he wished he had never put forward the policy. \u201cI wish we had started the proper research and kept it going all this time,\u201d he said. \u201cI have regrets.\u201d\n\nIf Americans had this research, Congress would have a clearer picture of what effective policy steps would be to prevent these sickeningly familiar mass shootings. As the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 Yogin Kothari pointed out on Thursday, \u201cSince 2013, there have been 290 school shootings, an average of nearly one per week. In 2018, there have been 18 school shootings in 45 days.\u201d Then again, it\u2019s already widely accepted that reducing gun ownership would reduce gun violence. The New York Times\u2019 Max Fischer and Josh Keller last November addressed the question, \u201cWhat Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps, some speculate, it is because American society is unusually violent. Or its racial divisions have frayed the bonds of society. Or its citizens lack proper mental care under a health care system that draws frequent derision abroad. These explanations share one thing in common: Though seemingly sensible, all have been debunked by research on shootings elsewhere in the world. Instead, an ever-growing body of research consistently reaches the same conclusion. The only variable that can explain the high rate of mass shootings in America is its astronomical number of guns. \n\n\n\nThis, perhaps, is why Republicans are opposed to federal funding of gun violence research: They know what the conclusion will be. And as long as the research is being conducted independently of the federal government, Republicans can discredit it just like they do to environmental research: by accusing it of bias, or lack of rigor, or insufficient data. If Congress does not reverse this prohibition in March, and the Republicans are to blame, it will be up to voters to punish them for it this fall."}, "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/justice-minister-israel-s-jewish-majority-trumps-than-human-rights-1.5811106": {"title": "Justice minister: Israel must keep Jewish majority even at the expense of human rights", "keywords": ["Asylum seekers", "  Jewish nation-state", "  Israel High Court", "Israel news", " News from Israel", " Israeli business", " Israeli politics"], "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/justice-minister-israel-s-jewish-majority-trumps-than-human-rights-1.5811106", "text": "Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said Monday that if not for the fence erected some years ago on the Egyptian border, \u201cWe would be seeing here a kind of creeping conquest from Africa.\u201d The fence effectively stopped asylum-seekers from Sudan and Eritrea from entering the country.\n\nIn a speech to the Congress on Judaism and Democracy, Shaked also said, \u201cI think that \u2018Judaizing the Galilee\u2019 is not an offensive term. We used to talk like that. In recent years we\u2019ve stopped talking like that. I think it\u2019s legitimate without violating the full rights of the Arab residents of Israel.\u201d\n\nThe justice minister made the remarks in a wide-ranging speech on the controversy over the Jewish nation-state bill.\n\nShe further said, \u201cThere is place to maintain a Jewish majority even at the price of violation of rights.\u201d She added, however, that maintaining a Jewish majority in Israel and acting democratically \u201cmust be parallel and one must not outweigh the other.\u201d\n\nRegarding the nation-state bill, Shaked said, \u201cI was disturbed at both the position of the state and the reasoning of the justices. The state did not defend the law for national demographic reasons, it claimed only security reasons.\u201d Shaked told the conference that \u201cthe state should say that there is place to maintain the Jewish majority even if it violates rights.\u201d\n\nShaked said she believed Judaism and democracy are values that can coexist. \u201cFrom a constitutional point of view there is an advantage to democracy and it must be balanced and the Supreme Court should be given another constitutional tool that will also give power to Judaism.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the nation-state bill, she said, was to prevent rulings interpreting the Entry to Israel Law, or a ruling like the one in the Ka\u2019adan case in 2000 that banned discrimination against an Arab family who wanted to move to a small Jewish community that sought to bar them.\n\n\u201cIn our laws there are universal values, rights, already enshrined in a very serious way. But the national and the Jewish values are not enshrined. Over the past 20 years, there has been more of a focus on rulings over universal values and less over the Jewish character of the state. This tool [the nation state bill] is a tool that we want to give the court for the future,\u201d said the justice minister.\n\nIn response to a question from the interviewer, TV journalist Dana Weiss, on whether the court could not consider the Jewish character of the state without a nation-state law, she said: \u201cIt can, but it\u2019s as if you\u2019d say that without the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty the court won\u2019t care about dignity and human rights. It\u2019s different when you have a constitutional tool.\u201d\n\nShaked: Court could take 'equality' very far\n\nOn the coalition\u2019s intent to keep the word \u201cequality\u201d out of the nation-state bill, Shaked said: \u201cIsrael is a Jewish state. It isn\u2019t a state of all its nations. That is, equal rights to all citizens but not equal national rights.\u201d Shaked said the word \u201cequality\u201d was very general and the court could take it \u201cvery far,\u201d adding, \u201cThere are places where the character of the State of Israel as a Jewish state must be maintained and this sometimes comes at the expense of equality.\u201d\n\nShaked said the nation-state bill did not deal with the issue of who is a Jew. \u201cEveryone has his own Judaism. In the nation-state bill, when it talks about a Jew, it means the nationality.\u201d Shaked then referred to the Ka\u2019adan ruling and said that if such a case were to come up again or \u201cthe argument over whether it\u2019s all right for a Jewish community to, by definition, be only Jewish, I want the answer to be \u2018yes, it\u2019s all right.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe question of the legality of the Family Unification Law, which prevents the unification of families where one of the couple is Palestinian and one is Arab Israeli, was twice decided at the time by the Supreme Court by one vote, with six justices supporting it and five dissenting.

His answers weren\u2019t well received in Florida, but Kaepernick continued to mention what he viewed as positives of Castro\u2019s regime after the 31-24 loss to Miami.\n\n\u201cWhat I said was I agree with the investment in education,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cI also agree with the investment in free universal health care, as well as him helping end apartheid in South Africa.

He played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and Pan-Africanist, he led the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) party from 1958 until his death.\n\nShortly after Congolese independence in 1960, a mutiny broke out in the army, marking the beginning of the Congo Crisis. Lumumba appealed to the United States and the United Nations for help to suppress the Belgian-supported Katangan secessionists. Both refused, so Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for support. This led to growing differences with President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and chief-of-staff Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu, as well as with the United States and Belgium.\n\nLumumba was subsequently imprisoned by state authorities under Mobutu and executed by a firing squad under the command of Katangan authorities. Following his death, he was widely seen as a martyr for the wider Pan-African movement.\n\nPatrice Lumumba was born on 2 July 1925 to a farmer, Fran\u00e7ois Tolenga Otetshima, and his wife Julienne Wamato Lomendja, in Onalua in the Katakokombe region of the Kasai province of the Belgian Congo.[5] He was a member of the Tetela ethnic group and was born with the name \u00c9lias Okit'Asombo. His original surname means \"heir of the cursed\" and is derived from the Tetela words okit\u00e1/okit\u0254\u0301 ('heir, successor')[6] and asomb\u00f3 ('cursed or bewitched people who will die quickly').[7] He had three brothers (Ian Clark, \u00c9mile Kalema, and Louis Onema Pene Lumumba) and one half-brother (Tolenga Jean).[5] Raised in a Catholic family, he was educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic missionary school, and finally the government post office training school, where he passed the one-year course with distinction. Lumumba spoke Tetela, French, Lingala, Swahili, and Tshiluba.[5]\n\nOutside of his regular studies, Lumumba took an interest in the Enlightenment ideals of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. He was also fond of Moli\u00e8re and Victor Hugo. He wrote poetry, and many of his works had an anti-imperialist theme.[8]\n\nHe worked in L\u00e9opoldville and Stanleyville as a postal clerk and as a travelling beer salesman. In 1951, he married Pauline Opangu. In 1955, Lumumba became regional head of the Cercles of Stanleyville and joined the Liberal Party of Belgium, where he edited and distributed party literature. After a study tour in Belgium in 1956, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement from the post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine.[9]\n\nAfter his release, he helped found the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) party on 5 October 1958, and quickly become the organization's leader.[8]\n\nThe MNC, unlike other Congolese parties, did not draw on a particular ethnic base.[10] It promoted a platform that included independence, gradual Africanization of the government, state-led economic development, and neutrality in foreign affairs. Lumumba himself had a large popular following, due to his personal charisma, excellent oratorical skills, and ideological sophistication.[10] This allowed him more political autonomy than his Belgian-dependent contemporaries.[11]\n\nLumumba was one of the delegates that represented the MNC at the All-African Peoples' Conference in Accra, Ghana, in December 1958. At this international conference, hosted by Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah, Lumumba further solidified his Pan-Africanist beliefs. Nkrumah was personally impressed by Lumumba's intelligence and ability.[12]\n\nIn late October 1959, Lumumba, as leader of the organization, was arrested for inciting an anti-colonial riot in Stanleyville; 30 people were killed. He was sentenced to 69 months in prison. The trial's start date of 18 January 1960 was the first day of the Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels to finalize the future of the Congo.\n\nDespite Lumumba's imprisonment at the time, the MNC won a convincing majority in the December local elections in the Congo. As a result of strong pressure from delegates upset with Lumumba's trial, he was released and allowed to attend the Brussels conference.\n\nThe conference culminated on 27 January with a declaration of Congolese independence, and set 30 June 1960 as the independence date with national elections to be held from 11\u201325 May 1960. Lumumba and the MNC won this election and formed a government, announced on 23 June 1960, with the 34-year-old Lumumba as prime minister and Joseph Kasa-Vubu as president. In accordance with the constitution, on 24 June the new government, a unitary system, passed a vote of confidence and was ratified by the Congolese Chamber and Senate.[clarification needed]\n\nIndependence Day was celebrated on 30 June in a ceremony attended by many dignitaries, including King Baudouin of Belgium and the foreign press.[13] Baudouin's speech praised developments under colonialism, his reference to the \"genius\" of his great-granduncle Leopold II of Belgium, glossing over atrocities committed during the existence of the Congo Free State.[14] Belgian prime minister Gaston Eyskens, who checked the text, considered that this passage went too far. He wanted completely to get rid of this reference to L\u00e9opold II. The King had limited political power in Belgium, but he was free to write his own speeches (after revision by the government).[15] The King continued, \"Don't compromise the future with hasty reforms, and don't replace the structures that Belgium hands over to you until you are sure you can do better. Don't be afraid to come to us. We will remain by your side, give you advice.\"[16] President Kasa-Vubu thanked the King.\n\nLumumba, who had not been scheduled to speak, delivered an impromptu speech that reminded the audience that the independence of the Congo had not been granted magnanimously by Belgium:[13]\n\nMost European journalists were shocked by the stridency of Lumumba's speech.[18] The Western media lashed out at Lumumba. Time spoke of a \u2018venomous attack\u2019. In the West, many saw this speech as a call to arms opening up Belgian-Congolese hostilities, plunging the former Belgian colony into chaos.[19]\n\nA few days after independence, Lumumba raised the pay of all government employees, except for Force Publique military personnel, causing discontent among their ranks. Many members of the post-independence Force Publique had strong objections to having Belgian-only officers; General \u00c9mile Janssens, the army head, told them nothing would change after independence. Soldiers also believed that Lumumba's promises of officer training for Congolese members would take too long to come to fruition.[20] They mutinied in protest in Leopoldville and Thysville on 5 July 1960, beginning the Congo Crisis.\n\nThe next day Lumumba dismissed Janssens and promoted all Congolese soldiers one grade, but mutinies spread out into the Lower Congo.[21] Although the trouble was highly localized, the country seemed to be overrun by gangs of soldiers and looters.[clarification needed] This caused a media sensation, which highlighted the Europeans fleeing the country.[22] In response, Lumumba announced over the radio, \"Thoroughgoing reforms are planned in all sectors. My government will make every possible effort to see that our country has a different face in a few months, a few weeks.\" In spite of government efforts, the mutinies continued.[23] Mutineers in Leopoldville and Thysville surrendered only upon the personal intervention of Lumumba and President Kasa-Vubu.[24] On 8 July, Lumumba renamed the Force Publique the \"Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise\" (ANC). He Africanized the force by appointing Sergeant Major Victor Lundula as general and commander-in-chief and chose junior minister and former soldier Joseph Mobutu as colonel and Army chief of staff. These promotions were made in spite of Lundula's inexperience and rumours about Mobutu's ties to Belgian and American intelligence services.[20] All European officers were replaced, with a few retained as advisers. By the next day the mutinies had spread throughout the entire country.[21] Five Europeans, including the Italian vice-consul, were ambushed and killed by machine gun fire in \u00c9lisabethville and nearly the entire European population of Luluabourg barricaded itself in an office building for safety.[25] An estimated two dozen Europeans were murdered in the mutiny.[26] Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu embarked on a tour across the country to promote peace and appoint new ANC commanders.[25]\n\nBelgium intervened on 10 July, dispatching 6,000 troops to the Congo, ostensibly to protect its citizens from the violence. Most Europeans went to Katanga Province, which possessed much of the Congo's natural resources.[4] Though personally angered, Lumumba condoned the action on 11 July, provided that the Belgian forces acted only to protect their citizens, followed the direction of the Congolese army, and ceased their activities once order was restored.[23][24][26] The same day the Belgian Navy bombarded Matadi after it had evacuated its citizens, killing 19 Congolese. This greatly inflamed tensions, leading to renewed Congolese attacks on Europeans. Shortly thereafter Belgian forces moved to occupy cities throughout the country, including the capital, where they clashed with Congolese soldiers.[24] On the whole, the Belgian intervention made the situation worse for the ANC.[26]\n\nThe State of Katanga declared independence under regional premier Mo\u00efse Tshombe on 11 July, with support from the Belgian government and mining companies such as Union Mini\u00e8re.[27] Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu were denied use of \u00c9lisabethville's airstrip the following day and returned to the capital, only to be accosted by fleeing Belgians.[28] They sent a protest of the Belgian deployment to the United Nations, requesting that they withdraw and be replaced by an international peacekeeping force.\n\nThe UN Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 143, calling for immediate removal of Belgian forces and establishment of the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). Despite the arrival of UN troops, unrest continued. Lumumba requested UN troops to suppress the rebellion in Katanga, but the UN forces were not authorized to do so under their mandate. On 14 July Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu broke off relations with Belgium, and sent a telegram to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, requesting that he closely monitor the situation in the Congo.[29]\n\nLumumba had originally desired technical assistance from Belgium and the West, but wanted to avoid taking sides with either the United States or the Soviet Union in the Cold War. By maintaining a policy of \"positive neutralism\", he hoped to create a unique and independent country.[12] Since the United Nations refused to help subdue Katanga, Lumumba sought Soviet aid in the form of arms, food, medical supplies, trucks, and planes to help move troops to Katanga. His decision to turn to the Soviet Union alarmed the West, particularly the United States.\n\nOn 24 July, Lumumba traveled to New York City, where he met with UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. African delegates, who had extended the original invitation, suggested arranging a meeting with the American State Department in Washington, D.C. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was on vacation at the time and unable to meet Lumumba. He had a lengthy interview with Secretary of State Christian Herter, much to the chagrin of the Belgian government. Lumumba expressed his dissatisfaction with the Belgian troops in the Congo and requested American aid. Herter reiterated that the U.S. would assist the Congo only as part of a greater UN effort.[30] According to David Van Reybrouck, while staying at the Blair House, Lumumba requested that his CIA liaison send him a blonde prostitute. The request went over poorly.[31]\n\nOn 9 August Lumumba had a meeting with the Belgian ambassador, Jean van den Bosch. Shortly thereafter Bosch left the Congo under UN escort, and the Belgian flag was removed from the embassy in Leopoldville. The government declared a state of emergency and Lumumba called the army to service, threatening to invade Katanga.[23] In a press conference he stated, \"Belgium is destroying us, Belgium is sabotaging us, Belgium is stealing our money, but we will get help elsewhere.\" That same day South Kasai announced its secession from the Congo.[32]\n\nLumumba immediately ordered Congolese troops under Mobutu to put down the rebellion in South Kasai, which was home to strategic rail links that would be necessary for a campaign in Katanga. The operation was successful, but the conflict soon devolved into ethnic violence. The army became involved in massacres of Luba civilians. The people and politicians of South Kasai held Lumumba personally responsible for the actions of the army.[32] Kasa-Vubu publicly announced that only a federalist government could bring peace and stability to the Congo, breaking the tenuous political alliance Lumumba had with him and tilting the political favour in the country away from Lumumba's unitary state.[33] Ethnic tensions rose against him (especially around Leopoldville) and the Catholic Church openly criticized his government.[34]\n\nEven with South Kasai subdued, the Congo lacked the necessary strength to retake Katanga.[32] Lumumba had summoned an African conference in Leopoldville from 25\u201331 August, but no foreign heads of state appeared and no country pledged military support.[35] Lumumba demanded once again that UN peacekeeping soldiers assist in suppressing the revolt, threatening to bring in Soviet troops if they refused. The UN subsequently denied Lumumba the use of its forces, and the possibility of a direct Soviet intervention became increasingly likely.[32]\n\nPresident Kasa-Vubu began fearing a Lumumbist coup d'\u00e9tat would take place.[Note 2] On the evening of 5 September, Kasa-Vubu announced over radio that he had dismissed Lumumba and six of his ministers from the government for the massacres in South Kasai and for involving the Soviets in the Congo.[37] Upon hearing the broadcast, Lumumba made his way to the national radio station, which was under UN guard. Though they had been ordered to bar Lumumba's entry, the UN troops allowed the prime minister in, as they had no specific instructions to use force against him. Lumumba denounced his dismissal over the radio as illegitimate, and in turn labeled Kasa-Vubu a traitor and declared him deposed.[38]\n\nHe proceeded to Parliament and launched into a debate in which he, in the words of American Ambassador Clare Timberlake, \"devastated the points raised by the opposition\" and \"made Kasa-Vubu look ridiculous.\"[39] The newly appointed prime minister, Senate leader Joseph Il\u00e9o, failed to secure a vote of confidence,[32] which Lumumba won in the Senate on 8 September, 41 to 2 (with 6 abstentions).[40] Still, Parliament did not back Lumumba's dismissal of Kasa-Vubu, creating a constitutional crisis. Numerous African diplomats and newly appointed ONUC head Rajeshwar Dayal attempted to get the president and prime minister to reconcile their differences, but failed.[37] On 13 September, the Parliament held a joint session between the Senate and the Assembly. Though several members short of a quorum, they voted to grant Lumumba emergency powers.[36]\n\nOn 14 September, a coup d'\u00e9tat organised by Colonel Mobutu politically incapacitated both Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu.[22] Lumumba was placed under house arrest on the next day at the Prime Minister's residence. UN troops were positioned around the house to prevent his arrest at the hands of Mobutu's troops, who formed an outer circle around the residence to prevent his escape.[41] On 24 November, the UN voted to recognize Mobutu's new delegates to the General Assembly, disregarding Lumumba's original appointees. Lumumba resolved to join Deputy Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga in Stanleyville and lead a campaign to regain power. Three days later he fled L\u00e9opoldville.[42]\n\nWith logistical support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu's troops managed to capture Lumumba in Lodi on 1 December. He was moved to Port Francqui the next day and flown back to L\u00e9opoldville. UN forces did not interfere.[42] Mobutu claimed Lumumba would be tried for inciting the army to rebellion and other crimes.\n\nSecretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld made an appeal to Kasa-Vubu asking that Lumumba be treated according to due process. The Soviet Union denounced Hammarskj\u00f6ld and the First World as responsible for Lumumba's arrest and demanded his release.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was called into session on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba's immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo. The Soviets also requested the immediate resignation of Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the arrests of Mobutu and Tshombe, and the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces.[43] Hammarskj\u00f6ld, answering Soviet criticism of his Congo operations, said that if the UN forces were withdrawn from the Congo \"I fear everything will crumble.\"\n\nThe threat to the UN cause was intensified by the announcement of the withdrawal of their contingents by Yugoslavia, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Indonesia, Morocco, and Guinea. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8\u20132. On the same day, a Western resolution that would have given Hammarskj\u00f6ld increased powers to deal with the Congo situation was vetoed by the Soviet Union.\n\nLumumba was sent first on 3 December 1960 to Thysville military barracks Camp Hardy, 150 km (about 100 miles) from L\u00e9opoldville. He was accompanied by Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito, two political associates who had planned to assist him in setting up a new government. They were malnourished by the prison guards as per Mobutu's orders. In Lumumba's last documented letter, he wrote to Rajeshwar Dayal: \"in a word, we are living amid absolutely impossible conditions; moreover, they are against the law\".[23] In the morning of 13 January 1961, discipline at Camp Hardy faltered. Soldiers refused to work unless they were paid. Some supported Lumumba's release, while others thought he was dangerous. Kasu-Vabu, Mobutu, Foreign Minister Justin Marie Bomboko, and Head of Security Services Victor Nendaka personally arrived at the camp and negotiated with the troops. Conflict was avoided, but it became apparent that holding a controversial prisoner in the camp was too great a risk.[44] Harold d'Aspremont Lynden, the former Belgian Minister of the Colonies, ordered that Lumumba, Mpolo, and Okito be taken to the State of Katanga.[45]\n\nLumumba was forcibly restrained on the flight to Elizabethville on 17 January 1961.[46] On arrival, he and his associates were conducted under arrest to the Brouwez House where they were brutally beaten and tortured by Katangan and Belgian officers,[47] while President Tshombe and his cabinet decided what to do with him.[48][49][50]\n\nLater that night, Lumumba was driven to an isolated spot where three firing squads had been assembled. A Belgian commission of inquiry found that the execution was carried out by Katanga's authorities. It reported that President Tshombe and two other ministers were present, with four Belgian officers under the command of Katangan authorities. Lumumba, Mpolo and Okito were lined up against a tree and shot one at a time. The execution is thought to have taken place on 17 January 1961, between 21:40 and 21:43 (according to the Belgian report). The Belgians and their counterparts later wished to get rid of the bodies, and did so by digging up and dismembering the corpses, then dissolving them in sulfuric acid while the bones were ground and scattered.[51]\n\nNo statement was released until three weeks later, despite rumours that Lumumba was dead. His death was formally announced over Katangan radio on 13 February, when it was alleged that he was killed by enraged villagers three days after escaping from Kolatey prison farm.[43]\n\nAfter the announcement of Lumumba's death, street protests were organized in several European countries; in Belgrade, capital of Yugoslavia, protesters sacked the Belgian embassy and confronted the police, and in London, a crowd marched from Trafalgar Square to the Belgian embassy, where a letter of protest was delivered and where protesters clashed with police.[52] In New York City, a demonstration at the United Nations Security Council turned violent and spilled over into the streets.[53][54]\n\nBoth Belgium and the US were clearly influenced by the Cold War in their positions toward Lumumba. He seemed to gravitate toward the Soviet Union, although according to Sean Kelly, who covered the events as a correspondent for the Voice of America, this was not because he was a communist, but because the USSR was the only place he could find support for his country's effort to rid itself of colonial rule.[55] The US was the first country from which Lumumba requested help.[56] Lumumba, for his part, not only denied being a communist, but said he found colonialism and communism to be equally deplorable. He professed his personal preference for neutrality between the East and West.[57]\n\nOn 18 January, panicked by reports that the burial of the three bodies had been observed, members of the execution team went to dig up the bodies and move them for reburial to a place near the border with Northern Rhodesia. Belgian Police Commissioner Gerard Soete later admitted in several accounts that he and his brother led the original exhumation. Police Commissioner Frans Verscheure also took part. On the afternoon and evening of 21 January, Commissioner Soete and his brother dug up Lumumba's corpse for a second time, cut it up with a hacksaw, and dissolved it in concentrated sulfuric acid.[58][59] In a 1999 interview on Belgian television in a program on the assassination of Lumumba, Soete displayed a bullet and two teeth that he claimed he had saved from Lumumba's body.[59]\n\nAccording to the 2001 Belgian Commission investigating Lumumba's assassination, (1) Belgium wanted Lumumba arrested, (2) Belgium was not particularly concerned with Lumumba's physical well being, and (3) although informed of the danger to Lumumba's life, Belgium did not take any action to avert his death. The report said that Belgium had not ordered Lumumba's assassination.[60]\n\nLumumba's execution was carried out by a firing squad led by Belgian Captain Julien Gat;[61][62] another Belgian, Police Commissioner Verscheure, had overall command of the execution site.[61]\n\nLudo De Witte found written orders from the Belgian government requesting Lumumba's execution and documents on various arrangements, such as death squads.[63]\n\nIn February 2002, the Belgian government apologized to the Congolese people, and admitted to a \"moral responsibility\" and \"an irrefutable portion of responsibility in the events that led to the death of Lumumba\".[64]\n\nThe report of 2001 by the Belgian Commission mentions that there had been previous U.S. and Belgian plots to kill Lumumba. Among them was a Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored attempt to poison him, which came on orders from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[65] CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, a key person in this plan, devised a poison resembling toothpaste. In September 1960, Gottlieb brought a vial of the poison to the Congo with plans to place it on Lumumba's toothbrush.[66][67][68] However, the plot was later abandoned; allegedly because the CIA Station Chief for the Congo, Larry Devlin, refused permission.[67][69]\n\nAs Kalb points out in her book, Congo Cables, the record shows that many communications by Devlin at the time urged elimination of Lumumba.[70] Also, the CIA station chief helped to direct the search to capture Lumumba for his transfer to his enemies in Katanga; Devlin was involved in arranging Lumumba's transfer to Katanga;[71] and the CIA base chief in Elizabethville was in direct touch with the killers the night Lumumba was killed. John Stockwell wrote in 1978 that a CIA agent had the body in the trunk of his car in order to try to get rid of it.[72][need quotation to verify] Stockwell, who knew Devlin well, felt Devlin knew more than anyone else about the murder.[73]\n\nThe inauguration of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in January 1961 caused fear among Mobutu's faction and within the CIA that the incoming administration would shift its favor to the imprisoned Lumumba.[74] While awaiting his presidential inauguration, Kennedy had come to believe that Lumumba should be released from custody, though not be allowed to return to power.[32] Lumumba was killed three days before Kennedy's inauguration on 20 January, though Kennedy would not learn of the killing until 13 February.[75]\n\nIn 1975 the Church Committee went on record with the finding that CIA chief Allen Dulles had ordered Lumumba's assassination as \"an urgent and prime objective\".[76] Furthermore, declassified CIA cables quoted or mentioned in the Church report and in Kalb (1972) mention two specific CIA plots to murder Lumumba: the poison plot and a shooting plot. Although some sources claim that CIA plots ended when Lumumba was captured, that is not stated or shown in the CIA records.\n\nThe Committee later found that while the CIA had conspired to kill Lumumba, it was not directly involved in the actual murder.[77]\n\nDeclassified documents reveal that the CIA had plotted to assassinate Lumumba. These documents indicate that the Congolese leaders who killed Lumumba, including Mobutu Sese Seko and Joseph Kasa-Vubu, received money and weapons directly from the CIA.[67][78] This same disclosure showed that at that time the U.S. government believed that Lumumba was a communist and feared him because of the Cold War.[79]\n\nIn 2000 a newly declassified interview with Robert Johnson, who was the minutekeeper of the U.S. National Security Council at the time in question, revealed that U.S. President Eisenhower had said \"something [to CIA chief Allen Dulles] to the effect that Lumumba should be eliminated.\"[77] The interview from the Senate Intelligence Committee's inquiry on covert action was released in August 2000.[80]\n\nIn December 2013, the U.S. State Department admitted that President Eisenhower authorized the murder of Lumumba.[81] However, documents released in 2017 revealed that an American role in Lumumba's murder was only under consideration by the CIA.[82][83] CIA Chief Allan Dulles had allocated $100,000 to accomplish the act, but the plan was not carried out.[84]\n\nIn April 2013, in a letter to the London Review of Books, British parliamentarian David Lea reported having discussed Lumumba's death with MI6 officer Daphne Park shortly before she died in March 2010. Park had been posted to Leopoldville at the time of Lumumba's death, and was later a semi-official spokesperson for MI6 in the House of Lords.[85]\n\nAccording to Lea, when he mentioned \"the uproar\" surrounding Lumumba's abduction and murder, and recalled the theory that MI6 might have had \"something to do with it\", she replied, \"We did. I organised it.\"[86] BBC reported that, subsequently, \"Whitehall sources\" described the claims of MI6 involvement as \"speculative\".[87]\n\nPatrice Lumumba was Prime Minister of The Congo for 80 days, from 24 June to 14 September 1960. To his supporters, Lumumba was an altruistic man of strong character. He favoured a unitary Congo and opposed division of the country along ethnic or regional lines.[89][90] Like many other African leaders, he supported pan-Africanism and liberation for colonial territories.[91] He proclaimed his regime one of \"positive neutralism,\"[92] defined as a return to African values and rejection of any imported ideology, including that of the Soviet Union: \"We are not Communists or Catholics. We are African nationalists.\"[93]\n\nThe image of Patrice Lumumba continues to serve as an inspiration in contemporary Congolese politics. In the 2006 elections, several parties claimed to be motivated by his ideas, including the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD), the political party initiated by the incumbent President Joseph Kabila.[94] Antoine Gizenga, who served as Lumumba's Deputy Prime Minister in the post-independence period, was a 2006 Presidential candidate under the Unified Lumumbist Party (Parti Lumumbiste Unifi\u00e9 (PALU))[95] and was named prime minister at the end of the year. His campaign platform was based on Lumumba's ideas. Other political parties that directly utilise his name include the Mouvement National Congolais-Lumumba (MNC-L) and the Mouvement Lumumbiste (MLP).\n\nPatrice Lumumba's family is actively involved in contemporary Congolese politics. Patrice Lumumba was married to Pauline Lumumba and had five children; Fran\u00e7ois was the eldest followed by Patrice Junior, Julienne, Roland and Guy-Patrice Lumumba. Fran\u00e7ois was 10 years old when Patrice died. Before his imprisonment, Patrice arranged for his wife and children to move into exile in Egypt.\n\nLumumba's youngest son, Guy-Patrice, born six months after his father's death, was an independent presidential candidate in the 2006 elections,[96] but received less than 10% of the vote."}, "http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/lawyers-for-death-row-inmate-say-mo-could-be-about/article_edb01294-3d89-5bf6-823e-5a10f8747cc4.html": {"title": "Greitens stops execution after questions about DNA evidence", "keywords": ["", " lisha gayle", " marcellus williams", " dna test", " kent gipson", " law", " criminal law", " crime", " dna"], "url": "http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/lawyers-for-death-row-inmate-say-mo-could-be-about/article_edb01294-3d89-5bf6-823e-5a10f8747cc4.html", "text": "Gov.

In light of new information, I am appointing a Board of Inquiry in this case.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Here's our updated story with more information and reactions\n\nIs the state of Missouri about to execute an innocent man for murder?\n\nAttorneys for Marcellus Williams, who is scheduled to die by injection at 6 p.m. Tuesday, insist it could be, after DNA found on the murder weapon did not match Williams\u2019.\n\nWilliams, 48, was sentenced to death in 2001 for the fatal stabbing of former Post-Dispatch reporter Lisha Gayle, 42, at her home in University City on Aug. 11, 1998. The prosecution said Williams was burglarizing the home when Gayle, who had been taking a shower, surprised him. She fought for her life as she was stabbed repeatedly.\n\nWilliams\u2019 attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop his execution. They are seeking a new hearing or the commutation of his sentence to life in prison. And they are asking Gov. Eric Greitens to grant clemency.\n\nThe attorneys claim recent DNA tests could prove Williams\u2019 innocence. Using technology that was not available at the time of the killing, those tests show that DNA found on the knife matched an unknown male, according to an analysis by Greg Hampikian, a biologist with Boise State University.\n\nThe Missouri Supreme Court in 2015 postponed Williams\u2019 execution to allow time for the DNA tests, but last week after results of those tests were made available, the same court denied his petition to stop the execution and either appoint a special master to hear his innocence claim or vacate the death sentence and order his sentence commuted to life in prison.\n\nNow the attorneys have taken the argument to Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, circuit justice for the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Missouri and six other Midwestern states. Gorsuch had not ruled by Monday evening.\n\nIn its response to the U.S. Supreme Court, the state said it had a wealth of non-DNA evidence to convict Williams. The state could prove Williams had sold Gayle\u2019s laptop to a third party after the killing, and had two witnesses who independently said he confessed to them. And, the state said, the lack of DNA evidence did not mean he was innocent.\n\nA spokesman for Greitens said members of the governor\u2019s staff \u201cwill not be able to comment\u201d about the clemency request until Tuesday.\n\nThe case has attracted national attention because no forensic evidence has ever pointed to Williams, and now what has been tested points away from him.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fairness, what do you do when you\u2019ve said somebody should get DNA testing, and they get the DNA testing, and the DNA testing suggests they didn\u2019t commit the murder?\u201d asked Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse for studies and reports related to capital punishment. \u201cMissouri is trying to execute him without giving him an evidentiary hearing on what that DNA evidence means.\u201d\n\nHe said DNA exonerations in the last two decades have \u201cshown us that all the other evidence the jury relied on in those cases was wrong. And in case after case after case, prosecutors and judges had said it doesn\u2019t matter because there is overwhelming evidence of guilt.\u201d\n\nGayle was a Post-Dispatch reporter from 1981 to 1992.

It took place with an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 25 October (7 November, New Style) 1917.\n\nIt followed and capitalized on the February Revolution of the same year, which overthrew the Tsarist autocracy and resulted in a provisional government after a transfer of power proclaimed by Grand Duke Michael, brother of Tsar Nicolas II, who declined to take power after the Tsar stepped down. During this time, urban workers began to organize into councils (Russian: Soviet) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. After the Congress of Soviets, now the governing body, had its second session, it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other leftist groups such as the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to important positions within the new state of affairs. This immediately initiated the establishment of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, the world's first self-proclaimed socialist state. On 17 July 1918, the Tsar and his family were executed.\n\nThe revolution was led by the Bolsheviks, who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military Revolutionary Committee began the occupation of government buildings on 7 November 1917 (New Style). The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia), was captured.\n\nThe long-awaited Constituent Assembly elections were held on 12 November 1917. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which won 370 seats, although the SR Party no longer existed as a whole party by that time, as the Left SRs had gone into coalition with the Bolsheviks from October 1917 to March 1918. The Constituent Assembly was to first meet on 28 November 1917, but its convocation was delayed until 5 January 1918 by the Bolsheviks. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved the next day by order of the Congress of Soviets.[3]\n\nAs the revolution was not universally recognized, there followed the struggles of the Russian Civil War (1917\u201322) and the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922.\n\nAt first, the event was referred to as the October coup (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442) or the Uprising of 3rd, as seen in contemporary documents (for example, in the first editions of Lenin's complete works). In Russian, however, \"\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\" has a similar meaning to \"revolution\" and also means \"upheaval\" or \"overturn\", so \"coup\" is not necessarily the correct translation. With time, the term October Revolution (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f) came into use. It is also known as the \"November Revolution\" having occurred in November according to the Gregorian Calendar.\n\nThe February Revolution had toppled Tsar Nicolas II of Russia, and replaced his government with the Russian Provisional Government. However, the provisional government was weak and riven by internal dissension. It continued to wage World War I, which became increasingly unpopular. A nationwide crisis developed in Russia, affecting social, economic, and political relations. Disorder in industry and transport had intensified, and difficulties in obtaining provisions had increased. Gross industrial production in 1917 had decreased by over 36% from what it had been in 1914. In the autumn, as much as 50% of all enterprises were closed down in the Urals, the Donbas, and other industrial centers, leading to mass unemployment. At the same time, the cost of living increased sharply. Real wages fell about 50% from what they had been in 1913. Russia's national debt in October 1917 had risen to 50 billion rubles. Of this, debts to foreign governments constituted more than 11 billion rubles. The country faced the threat of financial bankruptcy.\n\nThroughout June, July, and August 1917, it was common to hear working-class Russians speak about their lack of confidence and misgivings with those in power in the Provisional Government. Factory workers around Russia felt unhappy with the growing shortages of food, supplies, and other materials. They blamed their own managers or foremen and would even attack them in the factories. The workers blamed many rich and influential individuals, such as elites in positions of power, for the overall shortage of food and poor living conditions. Workers labelled these rich and powerful individuals as opponents of the Revolution, and called them words such as \"bourgeois, capitalist, and imperialist.\u201d[5]\n\nIn September and October 1917, there were mass strike actions by the Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in Baku, textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and railroad workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, more than a million workers took part in strikes. Workers established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a social revolution.[6] Workers were able to organize these strikes through factory committees. The factory committees represented the workers and were able to negotiate better working conditions, pay, and hours. Even though workplace conditions may have been increasing in quality, the overall quality of life for workers was not improving. There were still shortages of food and the increased wages workers had obtained did little to provide for their families.[5]\n\nBy October 1917, peasant uprisings were common. While the uprisings varied in severity, complete uprisings and seizures of the land were not uncommon. Less robust forms of protest included marches on landowner manors and government offices, as well as withholding and storing grains rather than selling them as a result of the economic crisis.[7] When the Provisional Government sent punitive detachments, it only enraged the peasants. The garrisons in Petrograd, Moscow, and other cities, the Northern and Western fronts, and the sailors of the Baltic Fleet in September declared through their elected representative body Tsentrobalt that they did not recognize the authority of the Provisional Government and would not carry out any of its commands.[8]\n\nSoldiers' wives were key players in unrest in the village. From 1914 to 1917, almost 50% of healthy men were sent to war, and many were killed on the front, resulting in a female occupation of the position of the household head. When government allowances were often late and were not sufficient to match the rising costs of goods, soldiers' wives sent masses of appeals and letters to the government, which largely were left unanswered. Frustration resulted, and these women were influential in inciting \"subsistence riots\" \u2013 also referred to as \"hunger riots,\" \"pogroms,\" or \"baba riots\". In these riots, citizens seized food and resources from shop owners who they believed to be charging unfair prices. Upon police intervention, protesters responded with \"rakes, sticks, rocks and fists\".[9]\n\nIn a diplomatic note of 1 May, the minister of foreign affairs, Pavel Milyukov, expressed the Provisional Government's desire to continue the war against the Central Powers \"to a victorious conclusion\", arousing broad indignation. On 1\u20134 May, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of Petrograd, and after them the workers and soldiers of other cities, led by the Bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading \"Down with the war!\" and \"all power to the soviets!\" The mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the Provisional Government.[10] 1 July saw more demonstrations, as about 500,000 workers and soldiers in Petrograd demonstrated, again demanding \"all power to the soviets\", \"down with the war\", and \"down with the ten capitalist ministers\". The Provisional Government opened an offensive against the Central Powers on 1 July, which soon collapsed. The news of the offensive and its collapse intensified the struggle of the workers and the soldiers. A new crisis in the Provisional Government began on 15 July.\n\nOn 16 July, spontaneous demonstrations of workers and soldiers began in Petrograd, demanding that power be turned over to the soviets. The Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party provided leadership to the spontaneous movements. On 17 July, over 500,000 people participated in what was intended to be a peaceful demonstration in Petrograd, the so-called July Days. The Provisional Government, with the support of Socialist-Revolutionary Party-Menshevik leaders of the All-Russian Executive Committee of the Soviets, ordered an armed attack against the demonstrators, killing hundreds.[11]\n\nA period of repression followed. On 5\u20136 July, attacks were made on the editorial offices and printing presses of Pravda and on the Palace of Kshesinskaya, where the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee of the Bolsheviks were located. On 7 July, the government ordered the arrest and trial of Vladimir Lenin. He was forced to go underground, as he had been under the Tsarist regime. Bolsheviks were arrested, workers were disarmed, and revolutionary military units in Petrograd were disbanded or sent to the war front. On 12 July, the Provisional Government published a law introducing the death penalty at the front. The second coalition government was formed on 24 July, chaired by Alexander Kerensky.[12]\n\nAnother problem for the government centered on General Lavr Kornilov, who had been Commander-in-Chief since 18 July. In response to a Bolshevik appeal, Moscow\u2019s working class began a protest strike of 400,000 workers. They were supported by strikes and protest rallies by workers in Kiev, Kharkov, Nizhny Novgorod, Ekaterinburg, and other cities.\n\nIn what became known as the Kornilov affair, Kornilov directed an army under Aleksandr Krymov to march toward Petrograd to restore order to Russia, with Kerensky's agreement.[13] Details remain sketchy, but Kerensky appeared to become frightened by the possibility the army would stage a coup, and reversed the order. By contrast, historian Richard Pipes has argued that the episode was engineered by Kerensky.[14] On 27 August, feeling betrayed by the government, Kornilov pushed on towards Petrograd. With few troops to spare on the front, Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries confronted the army and convinced them to stand down.[15] The Bolsheviks' influence over railroad and telegraph workers also proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. Right-wingers felt betrayed, and the left wing was resurgent.\n\nWith Kornilov defeated, the Bolsheviks' popularity in the soviets grew significantly, both in the central and local areas. On 31 August, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies, and on 5 September, the Moscow Soviet Workers Deputies adopted the Bolshevik resolutions on the question of power. The Bolsheviks won a majority in the Soviets of Briansk, Samara, Saratov, Tsaritsyn, Minsk, Kiev, Tashkent, and other cities.\n\nOn 23 October 1917 (November 5 new style), the Bolsheviks' Central Committee voted 10\u20132 for a resolution saying that \"an armed uprising is inevitable, and that the time for it is fully ripe\".[16] At the Committee meeting, Lenin discussed how the people of Russia had waited long enough for \u201can armed uprising\u201d, and it was the Bolsheviks' time to take power. Lenin expressed his confidence in the success of the planned insurrection. His confidence stemmed from months of Bolshevik buildup of power and successful elections to different committees and councils in major cities such as Petrograd and Moscow.[17]\n\nThe Bolsheviks created a revolutionary military committee within the Petrograd soviet, led by the soviet's president, Trotsky. The committee included armed workers, sailors and soldiers, and assured the support or neutrality of the capital's garrison. The committee methodically planned to occupy strategic locations through the city, almost without concealing their preparations: the Provisional Government's president Kerensky was himself aware of them, and some details, leaked by Kamenev and Zinoviev, were published in newspapers.[18][19]\n\nOn 25 October (7 November new style) 1917, Bolsheviks led their forces in the uprising in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg, then capital of Russia) against the Kerensky Provisional Government. The event coincided with the arrival of a flotilla of pro-Bolshevik marines, primarily five destroyers and their crews, in St. Petersburg harbor. At Kronstadt, sailors also announced their allegiance to the Bolshevik insurrection. In the early morning, the military-revolutionary committee planned the last of the locations to be assaulted or seized from its heavily guarded and picketed center in Smolny Palace. The Red Guards systematically captured major government facilities, key communication installations and vantage points with little opposition. The Petrograd Garrison and most of the city's military units joined the insurrection against the Provisional Government.[19]\n\nKerensky and the provisional government were virtually helpless to offer significant resistance. Railways and railway stations had been controlled by Soviet workers and soldiers for days, making rail travel to and from Petrograd impossible for Provisional Government officials. The Provisional Government was also unable to locate any serviceable vehicles. On the morning of the insurrection, Kerensky desperately searched for a means of reaching military forces he hoped would be friendly to the Provisional government outside the city, and ultimately borrowed a Renault car from the American Embassy, which he drove from the Winter Palace alongside a Pierce Arrow. Kerensky was able to evade the pickets going up around the palace and drive to meet approaching soldiers.[20]\n\nAs Kerensky left Petrograd, Lenin wrote a proclamation \"To the Citizens of Russia\" stating that the Provisional Government had been overthrown by the Military Revolutionary Committee. The proclamation was sent by telegraph throughout Russia even as the pro-Soviet soldiers were seizing important control centers throughout the city. One of Lenin's intentions was to present members of the Soviet congress, who would assemble that afternoon, with a fait accompli and thus forestall further debate on the wisdom or legitimacy of taking power.[20]\n\nA bloodless insurrection occurred with a final assault against the Winter Palace, with 3,000 cadets, officers, cossacks and female soldiers poorly defending the Winter Palace.[20][21] The Bolsheviks delayed the assault because the revolutionaries could not find functioning artillery. The Bolsheviks also prolonged the assault for fear of violence since the insurrection did not generate violent outbreaks. At 6:15 p.m., a large group of artillery cadets abandoned the palace, taking their artillery with them. At 8:00 p.m., 200 cossacks left the palace and returned to their barracks.[20] While the cabinet of the provisional government within the palace debated what action to take, the Bolsheviks issued an ultimatum to surrender. Workers and soldiers occupied the last of the telegraph stations, cutting off the cabinet's communications with loyal military forces outside the city. As the night progressed, crowds of insurgents surrounded the palace, and many infiltrated it.[20] While soviet historians and officials tended to depict the event in heroic terms, the insurrection and even the seizure of the Winter Palace happened almost without resistance.[19] At 9:45 p.m, the cruiser Aurora fired a blank shot from the harbor. Some of the revolutionaries entered the Palace at 10:25 p.m. and there was a mass entry 3 hours later. By 2:10 a.m on 26 October Bolshevik forces had gained control of the palace. After sporadic gunfire throughout the building, the cabinet of the provisional government had surrendered. The only member who was not arrested was Kerensky himself who had already left the Palace.[20][22]\n\nLater official accounts of the revolution from the Soviet Union would depict the events in October as being far more dramatic than they actually had been.[23] (See a first-hand account by British General Knox.) This was aided by the historical reenactment, entitled The Storming of the Winter Palace, which was staged in 1920. This reenactment, watched by 100,000 spectators, provided the model for official films made much later, which showed a huge storming of the Winter Palace and fierce fighting.[24] In reality, the Bolshevik insurgents faced little opposition.[21] The insurrection was timed and organized to hand state power to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on 25 October (7 November new style). After a single day of revolution, the death toll was low not because Bolsheviks decided not to use artillery fire, but instead because the class struggle was used as the strongest weapon.[25]\n\nSoviet government archives show that parties of Bolshevik operatives sent from the Smolny Institute by Lenin took over all critical centers of power in Petrograd in the early hours of the first night without a significant number of shots fired.[26] This was completed so efficiently that the takeover resembled the changing of the guard. There was not much of a storming of the Winter Palace because the resistance basically did not exist and at 2:10 a.m. on 26 October (8 November new style) 1917 the Red Guards took control of the Winter Palace. The Cossacks deserted when the Red Guard approached, and the Cadets and the 140 volunteers of the Women's Battalion surrendered rather than resist the 40,000 strong army.[27] The Aurora was commandeered to then fire blanks at the palace in a symbolic act of rejection of the government. The Bolsheviks effectively controlled the almost unoccupied Winter Palace not because of an intense military barrage, but because the back door was left open, allowing the Red Guard to enter.[28] The Provisional Government was arrested and imprisoned in Peter and Paul Fortress after the ministers resigned to fate and surrendered without a fight, and officially overthrown.\n\nLater stories of the heroic \"Storming of the Winter Palace\" and \"defense of the Winter Palace\" were later propaganda by Bolshevik publicists. Grandiose paintings depicting the \"Women's Battalion\" and photo stills taken from Sergei Eisenstein's staged film depicting the \"politically correct\" version of the October events in Petrograd came to be taken as truth.[29]\n\nWith the Petrograd Soviet now in control of government, garrison and proletariat, the Second All Russian Congress of Soviets held its opening session on the day, while Trotsky dismissed the opposing Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries (SR) from Congress.\n\nSome sources contend that as the leader of Tsentrobalt, Pavlo Dybenko played an enormous role in the revolt. It is said that the ten warships that entered the city with ten thousand Baltic fleet mariners was the force that actually took the power in Petrograd and put down the Provisional Government. The same mariners then dispersed by force the elected parliament of Russia,[30] and used machine-gun fire against protesting demonstrators in Petrograd. About 100 demonstrators were killed, and several hundreds wounded. Dybenko in his memoirs mentioned this event as \"several shots in the air\". Later, during the first hours after the taking of the Winter Palace, Dybenko personally entered the Ministry of Justice and destroyed there the documents about the financing of the Bolshevik party by Germany.[31] These are disputed by various sources such as Louise Bryant,[32] who claims that news outlets in the West at the time reported that the unfortunate loss of life occurred in Moscow, not Petrograd, and the number was much less than suggested above. As for the \"several shots in the air\", there is little evidence suggesting otherwise. The alleged action of Dybenko entering the Ministry of Justice to destroy documents as recalled by Savchenko can also be challenged. According to reports, Pavel Dybenko was in Helsingfors organizing the sailors' departures for Petrograd. In the book Radio October...On the \"Krechet\" in Helsingfors, radio operator Makarov hands a telegram to Pavel Dybenko with the report of the \"Samson\" commissar, Grigoriy Borisov: \"To Tsentrobalt. Everything is calm in Petrograd. The power is in the hands of the revolutionary committee. You have to immediately get in touch with the front committee of the Northern Army in order to preserve unity of forces and stability.\"\n\nThe Second Congress of Soviets consisted of 670 elected delegates; 300 were Bolshevik and nearly a hundred were Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who also supported the overthrow of the Alexander Kerensky Government.[33] When the fall of the Winter Palace was announced, the Congress adopted a decree transferring power to the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, thus ratifying the Revolution.\n\nThe transfer of power was not without disagreement. The center and Right wings of the Socialist Revolutionaries as well as the Mensheviks believed that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had illegally seized power and they walked out before the resolution was passed. As they exited, they were taunted by Leon Trotsky who told them \"You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are bankrupts; your role is played out. Go where you belong from now on \u2014 into the dustbin of history!\"[34]\n\nThe following day, 26 October, the Congress elected a new cabinet of Bolsheviks, pending the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. This basis for the new Soviet government was known as the Council (Soviet) of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom), with Lenin as leader. Lenin allegedly approved of the name, reporting that it \"smells of revolution\".[35] The cabinet quickly passed the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land. This new government was also officially called \"provisional\" until the Assembly was dissolved. Posters were pinned on walls and fences by the Right Socialist Revolutionaries, describing the takeover as a \"crime against the motherland and revolution\".\n\nOn 27 October 1917 (9 November new style), the Mensheviks seized power in Georgia and declared it an independent republic. The Don Cossacks also claimed control of their own government. The biggest Bolshevik strongholds were in the cities, particularly Petrograd, with support much more mixed in rural areas. The peasant dominated Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. There are reports that the Provisional Government had not conceded defeat and are meeting with the army at the Front.\n\nOn 28 October 1917,(10 November new style) some posters and newspapers started criticizing the actions of the Bolsheviks and refuted their authority. The Executive Committee of Peasants Soviets \"[refuted] with indignation all participation of the organised peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the working class\".[36] On 29 October 1917, opposition to the Bolsheviks developed into major counter-revolutionary action. Cossacks entered Tsarskoye Selo on outskirts of Petrograd with Kerensky riding on a white horse welcomed by church bells. Kerensky gave an ultimatum to the rifle garrison to lay down weapons, which was promptly refused. They were then fired upon by Kerensky\u2019s Cossacks, which resulted in 8 deaths. This turned soldiers in Petrograd against Kerensky because he was just like the Tsarist regime. Kerensky\u2019s failure to assume authority over troops was described by John Reed as a \u2018fatal blunder\u2019 that signalled the final death of the government.[37]\n\nOn 30 October 1917 (12 November new style), the battle against the anti-Bolsheviks continued. The Red Guard fought against Cossacks at Tsarskoye Selo, with the Cossacks breaking rank and fleeing, leaving their artillery behind.\n\nOn 31 October 1917 (13 November new style), the Bolsheviks gained control of Moscow after a week of bitter street-fighting. Artillery had been freely used with an estimated 700 casualties. However, there was still continued support for Kerensky in some of the provinces.\n\nOn 1 November 1917 (14 November new style), there was an appeal to anti-Bolsheviks throughout Russia to join the new government of the people, with the Bolsheviks winning even more support from the Russian people.\n\nOn 2 November 1917 (15 November new style), there was only minor public anti-Bolshevik sentiment; for example, the newspaper Novaya Zhizn criticised the lack of manpower and organisation of the Bolsheviks to run a party, let alone a government. Lenin confidently claimed that there is \"not a shadow of hesitation in the masses of Petrograd, Moscow and the rest of Russia\" towards Bolshevik rule.[38]\n\nOn 10 November 1917 (23 November new style), the government sought to label its citizens as \"citizens of the Russian Republic,\" and make them equal in all possible respects. This was accomplished by the nullification of all \"legal designations of civil equality, such as estates, titles, and ranks.[39]\n\nOn 12 November (25 November new style), a Constituent Assembly was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women.[40] The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets.\n\nOn 16 December 1917 (29 December 1917 new style), the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated.[39]\n\nOn 20 December 1917 (2 January 1918 new style), the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin.[41] These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror was started in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life. The Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904.[42]\n\nThe Decree on Land ratified the actions of the peasants who throughout Russia gained private land and redistributed it among themselves. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and peasants and memorialized that understanding with the Hammer and Sickle on the flag and coat of arms of the Soviet Union. Other decrees:\n\nBolshevik-led attempts to gain power in other parts of the Russian Empire were largely successful in Russia proper \u2014 although the fighting in Moscow lasted for two weeks \u2014 but they were less successful in ethnically non-Russian parts of the Empire, which had been clamoring for independence since the February Revolution. For example, the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared autonomy on 23 June 1917, created the Ukrainian People's Republic on 20 November, which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and, eventually, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on 25 January 1918.[43] In Estonia, two rival governments emerged: the Estonian Provincial Assembly, established in April 1917, proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia on 28 November 1917 and issued the Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918.[44] Soviet Russia recognized the Executive Committee of the Soviets of Estonia as the legal authority in the province, although the Soviets in Estonia controlled only the capital and a few other major towns.[45] The success of the October Revolution transformed the Russian state into a soviet republic. A coalition of anti-Bolshevik groups attempted to unseat the new government in the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922.\n\nIn an attempt to intervene in the civil war after the Bolsheviks' separate peace with the Central Powers, the Allied powers (United Kingdom, France, Italy, United States and Japan) occupied parts of the Soviet Union for over two years before finally withdrawing.[46] The United States did not recognize the new Russian government until 1933. The European powers recognized the Soviet Union in the early 1920s and began to engage in business with it after the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented.\n\nFew events in historical research have been as conditioned by political influences as the October Revolution.[47] The historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: the Soviet-Marxist view, the Western-Totalitarian view, and the Revisionist view.[48]\n\nSoviet historiography of the October Revolution is intertwined with Soviet historical development. Many of the initial Soviet interpreters of the Revolution were themselves Bolshevik revolutionaries.[49] After the initial wave of revolutionary narratives, Soviet historians worked within \"narrow guidelines\" defined by the Soviet government. The rigidity of interpretive possibilities reached its height under Joseph Stalin.[50]\n\nSoviet historians of the October Revolution interpreted the Revolution with regard to establishing the legitimacy of Marxist ideology, and also the Bolshevik government. To establish the accuracy of Marxist ideology, Soviet historians generally described the Revolution as the product of class struggle. They maintained that the Revolution was the supreme event in a world history governed by historical laws. The Bolshevik Party is placed at the center of the Revolution, exposing the errors of both the moderate Provisional Government and the spurious \"socialist\" Mensheviks in the Petrograd Soviet. Guided by Vladimir Lenin's leadership and his firm grasp of scientific Marxist theory, the Party led the \"logically predetermined\" events of the October Revolution from beginning to end. The events were, according to these historians, logically predetermined because of the socio-economic development of Russia, where the monopoly industrial capitalism alienated the masses. In this view, the Bolshevik party took the leading role in organizing these alienated industrial workers, and thereby established the construction of the first socialist state.[51]\n\nAlthough Soviet historiography of the October Revolution stayed relatively constant until 1991, it did undergo some changes. Following Stalin\u2019s death, historians such as E. N. Burdzhalov and P. V. Volobuev published historical research that deviated significantly from the party line in refining the doctrine that the Bolshevik victory \"was predetermined by the state of Russia\u2019s socio-economic development\".[52] These historians, who constituted the \"New Directions Group\", posited that the complex nature of the October Revolution \"could only be explained by a multi-causal analysis, not by recourse to the mono-causality of monopoly capitalism\".[53] For them, the central actor is still the Bolshevik party, but this party triumphed \"because it alone could solve the preponderance of \u2018general democratic\u2019 tasks the country faced\" (such as the struggle for peace, the exploitation of landlords, and so on.)[54]\n\nFollowing the turn of the 21st century, some Soviet historians began to implement an \"anthropological turn\" in their historiographical analysis of the Russian Revolution. This method of analysis focuses on the average person's experience of day-to-day life during the revolution, and pulls the analytical focus away from larger events, notable revolutionaries, and overarching claims about party views.[55] In 2006, S. V. Iarov employed this methodology when he focused on citizen adjustment to the new Soviet system. Iarov explored the dwindling labor protests, evolving forms of debate, and varying forms of politicization as a result of the new Soviet rule from 1917 to 1920.[56] In 2010, O. S. Nagornaia took interest in the personal experiences of Russian prisoners of war taken by Germany, examining Russian soldiers and officers' ability to cooperate and implement varying degrees of autocracy despite being divided by class, political views and race.[57] Other analyses following this \"anthropological turn\" have explored texts from soldiers and how they used personal war experiences to further their political goals,[58] as well as how individual life-structure and psychology may have shaped major decisions in the civil war that followed the revolution.[59]\n\nDuring the late Soviet period, the opening of select Soviet archives during glasnost sparked innovative research that broke away from some aspects of Marxism\u2013Leninism, though the key features of the orthodox Soviet view remained intact.[50]\n\nDuring the Cold War, Western historiography of the October Revolution developed in direct response to the assertions of the Soviet view. The Soviet version of the October Revolution conditioned historical interpretations in the United States and the West. As a result, these Western historians exposed what they believed were flaws in the Soviet view, thereby undermining the Bolsheviks' original legitimacy, as well as the precepts of Marxism.[60]\n\nThese Western historians described the revolution as the result of a chain of contingent accidents. Examples of these accidental and contingent factors they say precipitated the Revolution included World War I's timing, chance, and the poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas II as well as liberal and moderate socialists.[50] According to Western historians, it was not popular support, but rather manipulation of the masses, ruthlessness, and the superior structure of the Bolsheviks that enabled it to survive. For these historians, the Bolsheviks\u2019 defeat in the Constituent Assembly elections of November\u2013December 1917 demonstrated popular opposition to the Bolsheviks\u2019 coup, as did the scale and breadth of the Civil War.[61]\n\nWestern historians saw the organization of the Bolshevik party as proto-totalitarian. Their interpretation of the October Revolution as a violent coup organized by a proto-totalitarian party reinforced to them the idea that totalitarianism was an inherent part of Soviet history.[62] For them, Stalinist totalitarianism developed as a natural progression from Leninism and the Bolshevik party\u2019s tactics and organization.[63]\n\nThe dissolution of the USSR affected historical interpretations of the October Revolution. Since 1991, increasing access to large amounts of Soviet archival materials made it possible to re\u2011examine the October Revolution.[64] Though both Western and Russian historians now have access to many of these archives, the effect of the dissolution of the USSR can be seen most clearly in the work of historians in the former USSR. While the disintegration essentially helped solidify the Western and Revisionist views, post-USSR Russian historians largely repudiated the former Soviet historical interpretation of the Revolution.[65] As Stephen Kotkin argues, 1991 prompted \"a return to political history and the apparent resurrection of totalitarianism, the interpretive view that, in different ways\u2026revisionists sought to bury\".[66]\n\nThe term \"Red October\" (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c, Krasnyy Oktyabr) has also been used to describe the events of the month. This name has in turn been lent to a steel factory made notable by the Battle of Stalingrad,[67] a Moscow sweets factory that is well known in Russia, and a fictional Soviet submarine.\n\nTen Days That Shook the World, a book written by American journalist John Reed and first published in 1919, gives a firsthand exposition of the events. Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished.\n\nDmitri Shostakovich wrote his Symphony No. 2 in B major, Op. 14 and subtitled To October, for the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. The choral finale of the work, \"To October\", is set to a text by Alexander Bezymensky, which praises Lenin and the revolution. The Symphony No. 2 was first performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the Academy Capella Choir under the direction of Nikolai Malko, on 5 November 1927.\n\nSergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World, first released on 20 January 1928 in the USSR and on 2 November 1928 in New York City, describes and glorifies the revolution and was commissioned to commemorate the event.\n\n7 November, the anniversary of the October Revolution, was the official national day of the Soviet Union from 1918 onward and still is a public holiday in Belarus and the breakaway territory of Transnistria.\n\nThe October revolution of 1917 also marks the inception of the first communist government in Russia, and thus the first large-scale socialist state in world history. After this Russia became the Russian SFSR and later part of the USSR, which dissolved in late 1991."}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava_conflict": {"title": "Rojava conflict - Wikipedia", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava_conflict", "text": "The Rojava conflict, also known as the Rojava revolution, is a political upheaval, social revolution[6] and military conflict taking place in Northern Syria, known as Rojava. During the Syrian Civil War, a coalition of Arab, Kurdish, Syriac and some Turkmen groups have sought to establish the Constitution of Rojava inside the de facto autonomous region, while military wings and allied militias have fought to maintain control of the region. The revolution has been characterized by the prominent role played by women both on the battlefield and within the newly formed political system, as well as the implementation of democratic confederalism, a form of grassroots democracy based on local assemblies and direct democracy.\n\nThe area is strategically important, because it contains a large percentage of Syria's oil supplies.[7]\n\nRepression of the Kurds and other ethnic minorities has gone on since the creation of the French Mandate of Syria after the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement.[8] The Syrian government (officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic) never officially acknowledged the existence of the Kurds[8] and in 1962 120,000 Syrian Kurds were stripped of their citizenship, leaving them stateless.[9] The Kurdish language and culture have also been suppressed. The government attempted to resolve these issues in 2011 by granting all Kurds citizenship, but only an estimated 6,000 out of 150,000 stateless Kurds have been given nationality and most discriminatory regulations, including the ban on teaching Kurdish, are still on the books.[10] Due to the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, the government is no longer in a position to enforce these laws.\n\nIn 2004, riots broke out against the government in the northeastern city of Qamishli. During a soccer match between a local Kurdish team and a visiting Arab team from Deir ez-Zor, some Arab fans brandished portraits of Saddam Hussein (who slaughtered tens of thousands of Kurds in Southern Kurdistan during the genocidal Al-Anfal campaign in the 1980s). Tensions quickly escalated into open protests, with Kurds raising their flag and taking to the streets to demand cultural and political rights. Security forces fired into the crowd, killing six Kurds, including three children. Protesters went on to burn down the Ba'ath Party's local office. At least 30 and as many as 100 Kurds were killed by the government before the protests were quelled. Thousands of Kurds fled to Iraq afterwards, where a refugee camp was established. Occasional clashes between Kurdish protesters and government forces occurred in the following years.[11][12]\n\nIn 2011, the Arab Spring spread to Syria. Similar to the beginning of the Tunisian revolution, Syrian citizen Hasan Ali Akleh soaked himself in gasoline and set himself on fire in the northern city of Al-Hasakah. This inspired activists to call for a \"Day of Rage\", which ended up being sparsely attended, mostly because of fear of repression from the Syrian government. Days later, however, protests again took place, this time in response to the police beating of a shopkeeper.[13]\n\nSmaller protests continued, but it was on 7 March 2011, when thirteen political prisoners went on hunger strike, that momentum began to grow against the Assad government. Three days later dozens of Syrian Kurds went on hunger strike in solidarity.[14] On 12 March, major protests took place in Qamishli and Al-Hasakah to both protest the Assad government and commemorate Kurdish Martyrs Day.[15]\n\nProtests grew over the months of March and April 2011. The Assad government attempted to appease Kurds by promising to grant citizenship to thousands of Kurds, who until that time had been stripped of any legal status.[16] By the summer, protests had only intensified, as did violent crackdowns by the Syrian government.\n\nIn August, a coalition of opposition groups formed the Syrian National Council in hopes of creating a democratic, pluralistic alternative to the Assad government. However, internal fighting and disagreement over politics and inclusion plagued the group from its early beginnings. In the fall of 2011 the popular uprising escalated to an armed conflict. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) began to coalesce and armed insurrection spread, largely across the central and southern parts of Syria.[17]\n\nThe National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, a coalition of Syria's 12 Kurdish parties, boycotted a Syrian opposition summit in Antalya, Turkey on 31 May 2011, stating that \"any such meeting held in Turkey can only be a detriment to the Kurds in Syria, because Turkey is against the aspirations of the Kurds\".[18]\n\nDuring the August summit in Istanbul, which led to the creation of the Syrian National Council, only two of the parties in the National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, the Kurdish Union Party and the Kurdish Freedom Party, attended the summit.[19]\n\nAnti-government protests had been ongoing in the Kurdish-inhabited areas of Syria since March 2011, as part of the wider Syrian uprising, but clashes started after the opposition Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and Kurdish National Council (KNC) signed a seven-point agreement on 11 June 2012 in Erbil under the auspice of Iraqi Kurdistan president Massoud Barzani. This agreement, however, failed to be implemented and so a new cooperation agreement between the two sides was signed on 12 July which saw the creation of the Kurdish Supreme Committee as a governing body of all Kurdish-controlled territories in Syria.[20][21][22]\n\nThe People's Protection Units (YPG) entered the conflict by capturing the city of Koban\u00ee on 19 July 2012, followed by the capture of Amuda and Efr\u00een on 20 July.[23] The cities fell without any major clashes, as Syrian security forces withdrew without any significant resistance.[23] The Syrian Army pulled out to fight elsewhere.[24] The KNC and PYD afterwards formed a joint leadership council to run the captured cities.\n\nThe YPG forces continued with their advancement and on 21 July captured Al-Malikiyah (Kurdish: D\u00earika Hemko\u200e), which is located 10 kilometers from the Turkish border.[25] The rebels at the time also intended to capture Qamishli, the largest Syrian city with a Kurdish majority.[26] On the same day, the Syrian government attacked a patrol of Kurdish YPG members and wounded one fighter.[27] The next day it was reported that Kurdish forces were still fighting for Al-Malikiyah, where one young Kurdish activist was killed after government security forces opened fire on protesters. The YPG also took control over the towns of Ra's al-'Ayn (Kurdish: Ser\u00ea Kaniy\u00ea\u200e) and Al-Darbasiyah (Kurdish: Dirb\u00eas\u00ee\u200e), after the security and political units withdrew from these areas, following an ultimatum issued by the Kurds. On the same day, clashes erupted in Qamishli between YPG and government forces in which one Kurdish fighter was killed and two were wounded along with one government official.[28]\n\nThe ease with which Kurdish forces captured the towns and the government troops pulled back was speculated to be due to the government reaching an agreement with the Kurds so military forces from the area could be freed up to engage opposition forces in the rest of the country.[29] On 24 July, the PYD announced that Syrian security forces withdrew from the small Kurdish city of 16,000 of Al-Ma'bada (Kurdish: Girk\u00ea Leg\u00ea\u200e), located between Al-Malikiyah and the Turkish borders. The YPG forces afterwards took control of all government institutions.[30]\n\nOn 1 August 2012, Assad forces on the periphery of the country were pulled into the intensifying conflict taking place in Aleppo. During this large withdrawal from the north, the People's Protection Units (YPG), a pro-Kurdish militia that formed after the 2004 Qamishli riots,[31] took control of at least parts of Qamishlo, Efrin, Amude, Terbaspi and Ayn El Arab with very little conflict or casualties.[32]\n\nOn 2 August 2012, the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change announced that most Kurdish-majority cities in Syria, with the exception of Qamishli and Hasaka, were no longer controlled by government forces and were now being governed by Kurdish political parties.[33] In Qamishli, government military and police forces remained in their barracks and administration officials in the city allowed the Kurdish flag to be raised.[34]\n\nIn the same month, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) successfully bombed the government's intelligence center in the city.[35]\n\nAfter months of de facto rule, the PYD officially announced its regional autonomy on 9 January 2014. Elections were held, popular assemblies established and the Constitution of Rojava was approved. Since then, residents have been organizing local assemblies, re-opening schools, establishing community centers and pushing back the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to gain control of further territory. They see their model of grassroots democracy as a model that can be implemented throughout Syria in the future.\n\nAfter declaring autonomy, grassroots organizers, politicians and other community members have radically changed the social and political make-up of the area. The extreme laws restricting independent political organizing, women's freedom, religious and cultural expression and the discriminatory policies carried out by the Assad government have been superseded. In their place, a Constitution of Rojava guaranteeing the cultural, religious and political freedom of all people has been established. The constitution also explicitly states the equal rights and freedom of women and also \"mandates public institutions to work towards the elimination of gender discrimination\".[6]\n\nThe political and social changes taking place in Rojava have in large part been inspired by the libertarian socialist politics of Kurdish leader Abdullah \u00d6calan.[6]\n\nThe Rojava economy is a blend of private companies, the autonomous administration and worker cooperatives. Since the revolution, efforts have been made to transition the economy to one of self-sufficiency based on worker and producer cooperatives. This transition faces the major obstacles of ongoing conflict and an embargo from all neighboring countries: Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and the various forces controlling nearby areas of Syria. This has forced people to rely almost exclusively on diesel-run generators for electricity. Additionally, strong emphasis is being placed on businesses that can bring about self-sufficiency to the region.\n\nThere are no required taxes in Rojava.[citation needed] Instead the administration funds itself through the sale of oil and border commerce (which is clandestine because of the embargo). There are partnerships that have been created between private companies and the administration. The administration also funds the school system and distributes bread to all citizens at a below-market rate.[36]\n\nThe Movement for a Democratic Society Economic Committee has been helping businesses move towards a \"community economy\" based on worker cooperatives and self-sufficiency.[36]\n\nCooperatives first formed in the agricultural and infrastructure sectors. In the Jazira Canton there are 18 agricultural cooperatives, 12 general co-ops and six women-run co-ops.[citation needed]\n\nOther cooperatives involve bottled mineral water, construction, factories, fuel stations, generators, livestock, oil, pistachio and roasted seeds, and public markets.\n\nAdditionally there are several agricultural communes with families collectively working the land.[37]\n\nThe Rojava Cantons are governed through a combination of district and civil councils. District councils consist of 300 members as well as two elected co-presidents- one man and one woman. District councils decide and carry out administrative and economic duties such as garbage collection, land distribution and cooperative enterprises.[38] Civil councils exist to promote social and political rights in the community.\n\nClosely related to religious freedom and the protection of religious minorities is the protection of ethnic minorities. Kurds now have the right to study their language freely, as do Assyrians. For the first time, a Kurdish curriculum has been introduced to the public school system.\n\nResidents are also now free to express their culture freely. Culture and music centers have formed, hosting dance classes, music lessons and choir practice.[39]\n\nIn some areas, in addition to the gender quota for councils, there is also an ethnic minority quota.[40]\n\nThe criminal justice system is undergoing significant reforms, moving away from a punitive approach under the Assad government to one based on the principles of restorative justice[citation needed]. Reconciliation Committees have replaced the Syrian government court system in several cities.[41] Committees are representative of the ethnic diversity in their respective area. For example, the committee in Tal Abyad has Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen and Armenians.[42]\n\nUnder the Assad government, women face extreme forms of repression, violence and discrimination.[citation needed] Sexual assault and domestic violence occur at very high rates, with little protection under the law or through the courts.[citation needed] Conservative social norms restricts women's movement and participation in public life.[citation needed] Economic opportunities had begun to improve to a certain degree[citation needed], though since the civil war broke out the economy has collapsed in many areas.[43]\n\nFeminism, specifically jineology (the science of women), is central to the social revolution taking place in Rojava.[citation needed] Much of the focus of the revolution has been in addressing the extreme levels of violence which women in the area have endured as well as increasing women's leadership in all political institutions.[citation needed]\n\nAll YPG and YPJ fighters and Asayish have the study of jineology as part of their training, and it is also taught in community centers.[44]\n\nIn every town and village under YPG control, a women's house is established. These are community centers run by women, providing services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and other forms of harm. These services include counseling, family mediation, legal support, and coordinating safe houses for women and children.[45] Classes on economic independence and social empowerment programs are also held at women's houses.[46]\n\nEfforts are being made to reduce cases of underage marriage, polygamy and honor killings, both socially as well as through legislation forbidding these practices.[47]\n\nA key component of the direct democracy model being enacted in Rojava is co-leadership.[citation needed] Every major position in both civil and military institutions is led by a man and a woman.[citation needed] This is to ensure gender balance in power and decision-making, as well as a general level of accountability for the position as it requires two people to reach agreement on decisions made.[citation needed]\n\nA 40% gender quota is required of all councils in order for a vote to take place.[45]\n\nChristian Assyrians, Muslim Kurds and others have worked together[citation needed] both in fighting government forces and Islamist groups as well as in managing political affairs.[citation needed] The right to religious expression is also safeguarded in the constitution. This, as well as the extreme hostility towards religious minorities in Islamist controlled areas, has led to a large migration of religious minorities to Rojava.[48]\n\nFor the first time in Syrian history, civil marriage is being allowed and promoted. This is a significant move towards increased tolerance between people of different religious backgrounds.[49]\n\nThere are four major forces involved in the Rojava revolution. The People's Protection Units are working with the PYD and other political parties to establish self-rule in Rojava. Syrian government forces still maintain rule in some areas of Rojava under the leadership of the Assad regime. A collection of Islamic forces, the largest being ISIS, are fighting to rule the region by Sharia law. Finally, there are several militias under the general banner of the Free Syrian Army whose intentions and alliances have differed and shifted over time. At the moment, most FSA fighters are working with the YPG against Islamist forces and the Syrian government.\n\nWhile conflict between the YPG and the Syrian government has not been as active as fighting against Islamist forces, there have been several conflicts between the two forces. Territory once controlled by the Syrian government in both Qamishli and al-Hasakah has been lost to YPG forces. At the end of April 2016, clashes erupted between government forces and Kurdish fighters for the control of the city.[50]\n\nAs of the beginning of August 2016, YPG fighters controlled two-thirds of the northeastern city of al-Hasakah, while pro-government militia controlled the remainder. On 17 August 2016, heavy clashes broke out between Kurdish fighters and the pro-government militias, resulting in the deaths of four civilians, four Kurdish fighters, and three government loyalists. On 18 August, Syrian government aircraft bombed Kurdish positions in Hasakah, including three Kurdish checkpoints and three Kurdish bases. Syrian Kurds had recently demanded that the pro-government National Defense Forces militia disband in al-Hasakah. A government source told the AFP that the air strikes were \"a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty\".[51] Another possible factor behind the fighting may have been the recent thaw in Turkish-Russian relations that began in July 2016; Russia, a key ally of the Syrian government, had previously been supporting Syrian Kurdish forces as a means to apply pressure to Turkey. After the recent setbacks suffered by ISIS in Syria and Iraq and improvements in the Turkish-Russian relationship, it is possible that Russia and its allies began to view a strong YPG as increasingly less useful.[52]\n\nIn response to the attacks by the Syrian aircraft on Kurdish positions near al-Hasakah, the United States scrambled planes over the city in order to deter further attacks.[52]\n\nBy 22 August, Syrian government troops, Hezbollah fighters, and members of the Iranian paramilitary Basij militia had become involved in the fighting against Kurdish forces in al-Hasakah.[52]\n\nOn 28 December 2012, Syrian government forces opened fire on pro-FSA demonstrators in al-Hasakah city, killing and wounding several individuals. Arab tribes in the area attacked YPG positions in the city in reprisal, accusing the Kurdish fighters of collaborating with the government. Clashes broke out, and three Arabs were killed, though it was not clear whether they were killed by YPG forces or nearby government troops.[53] Demonstrations were organised by various Kurdish groups throughout Western Kurdistan in late December as well. PYD supporters drove vehicles at low speeds through a KNC demonstration in Qamishli, raising tensions between the two groups.[54]\n\nFrom 2 to 4 January, PYD-led demonstrators staged protests in the al-Antariyah neighbourhood of Qamishli, demanding \"freedom and democracy\" for both Kurds and Syrians. Many activists camped out on site. On 4 January, approximately 10,000 people were participating in the rallies, which also included smaller numbers of supporters of other Kurdish parties,[55] such as the KNC, which staged a rally in the Munir Habib neighbourhood. PYD organisers had planned for 100,000 people to participate, but such support did not materialise. The demonstrations were concurrent with rallies conducted across the country by the Arab opposition, though Kurdish parties did not use the same slogans as the Arabs, and also did not the same slogans amongst their own parties. Kurds also demonstrated in several other towns, but not across the entire Kurdish region.[56]\n\nMeanwhile, several armed incidents occurred between the dominant PYD-YPG and other Kurdish parties in the region, particularly the Kurdish Union (\"Yek\u00eet\u00ee\") Party, part of a Kurdish political coalition called the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union formed on 15 December 2012, which excludes the PYD.[57] On 3 January, PYD gunmen staged a drive-by shooting on a Yek\u00eet\u00ee office in Qamishli. Armed Yek\u00eet\u00ee members returned fire, injuring one PYD member.[58] The same day, armed clashes broke out between YPG fighters and members of the newly formed Jiwan Qatna Battalion of Yek\u00eet\u00ee in ad-Darbasiyah. Four Yek\u00eet\u00ee members were abducted by the YPG, who accused them of being affiliated with Islamist groups, though Yek\u00eet\u00ee activists alleged that the PYD wanted to prevent other Kurdish groups from arming themselves. Following demonstrations in the town demanding their release and an intervention by the KNC, the four men were released by the end of the day.[59] On 11 January, YPG forces raided an empty Yek\u00eet\u00ee training ground near Ali Faru which had been built in early January, tearing down both the Kurdish and FSA flags that had been flying at the base. Though PYD members defended the raid by saying that the flags could have attracted government airstrikes, Yek\u00eet\u00ee condemned the action.[60]\n\nOn 31 January, Kamal Mustafa Hanan, editor-in-chief of Newroz (a Kurdish-language journal) and a former Yek\u00eet\u00ee politician, was fatally shot in the Ashrafiyah district of Aleppo. It was not clear if he was the victim of a stray bullet or of a politically motivated assassination. Yek\u00eet\u00ee organised a funeral procession in the town of Afrin in the Kurdish-held northwest corner of Aleppo Province on 1 February, which members of both the PYD and KNC attended.[61] Also on 1 February, Kurds staged demonstrations in several towns and villages across West Kurdistan concurrent with opposition demonstrations elsewhere in the country. The demonstrations were organised by various Kurdish groups, including the PYD and KNC. Demonstrators from the KNC demanded an end to fighting in Ras al-Ayn and the withdrawal of armed groups from the town, while PYD demonstrators stressed solidarity with their YPG units and the Kurdish Supreme Council.[62]\n\nFrom 2 to 5 February, YPG forces blockaded the village of Kahf al-Assad (Kurdish: Ban\u00ea \u015eikeft\u00ea\u200e), inhabited by members of the Kurdish Kherikan tribe, after being fired upon by unknown gunmen in the village. YPG checkpoints were also established around other Kherikan villages. The Kherikan are traditionally supporters of the Massoud Barzani government of Iraqi Kurdistan, and as oppose the PYD. The blockade was the third time in two years that hostilities had broken out between the PYD/YPG and locals from Kahf al-Assad.[63]\n\nOn 7 February, YPG members kidnapped three members of the opposition Azad\u00ee party in Ayn al-Arab.[64]\n\nOn 22 February, Osman Baydemir, mayor of the city of Diyarbak\u0131r in Turkey, announced the initiation of a one-month humanitarian aid programme in which his city\u2014along with the surrounding districts of Ba\u011flar, Yeni\u015fehir, Kayap\u0131nar, and Sur\u2014would provide food assistance to Kurdish areas in Syria affected by the war, which had received little of the humanitarian aid that other regions of Syria had received.[65]\n\nOn 11 April 2016, PYD supporters attacked the offices of the Kurdish National Council and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria in Derbessiye and Qamishli.[66] The head of the Kurdish National Council told Turkey's TRT World channel the \"PYD's oppressive attitude in Syria is forcing Kurds to leave the region\".[67]\n\nOn 16 January 2017, more than 270 Syrian Kurdish activists signed an appeal calling for unity talks between the main Syrian Kurdish parties. In response, the Movement for a Democratic Society led by the PYD stated that they welcome unity and called on the Kurdish National Council to participate in federal project. The KNC led by the KDP-S, in response, demanded the release its political prisoners detained in Rojava. The KNC has rejected the federalism project launched by the Syrian Democratic Council and stated that it will participate in the peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, with Turkey and Russia. The Kurdish National Alliance in Syria, part of the SDC also welcomed the proposal of unity.[68]\n\nOn 3 February 2017, amidst clashes between the KDP-S-affiliated Peshmerga group and the Sinjar Resistance Units in Sinjar, a KNC office was burned in Qamishli and another attacked in Dirb\u00easiy\u00ea. The KNC accused the pro-PYD youth group the Ciwanen Soresger of perpetrating the attacks. However, the perpetrators were reportedly arrested by the Asayish.[69]\n\nOn 3 March 2017, the Rojava Asayish arrested more than 40 members of the KNC in Syria while the KDP Asayish arrested 23 opposition protesters in Iraqi Kurdistan. 17 of them were later released but 6 were still imprisoned. By 16 March, more than 13 KNC offices and an Assyrian Democratic Organization office in Rojava were shut down by Rojava Asayish forces, reportedly for failing to register with PYD authorities. In response, the Human Rights Watch called on both sides to \"immediately\" release all \"arbitrarily held political detainees\".[70] The Mesopotamia National Council announced their support for TEV-DEM's requirement for parties to apply to licenses to operate in Rojava. However, the council also called for the self-management to give sufficient time for applications and denounced \"random\" closing of the parties' offices.[71]\n\nOn 3 April 2017, the Kurdish National Council called on the PYD to release 4 of its detainees: a Kurdish Future Movement in Syria member, a Kurdish Youth Movement member, and two KDP-S members. As of the same day, 6 detainees were still held by Iraqi Kurdish authorities.[72]\n\nOn 12 April 2017, an official in TEV-DEM met with Gabriel Moushe Gawrieh, head of the Assyrian Democratic Organization, and discussed the closure of the latter's offices since March. It was the first time TEV-DEM officials met with the ADO.[73]\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish\u2013Islamist conflict is a major theater in the Syrian Civil War, starting in 2013 after fighting erupted between the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and Islamist rebel factions in the city of Ras al-Ayn. Kurdish forces launched a campaign in an attempt to take control of the Islamist-controlled areas in the governorate of al-Hasakah and some parts of Raqqa and Aleppo governorates after al-Qaeda in Syria used those areas to attack the YPG. The Kurdish groups and their allies' goal was also to capture Kurdish areas from the Arab Islamist rebels and strengthen the autonomy of the region of Rojava.[74]\n\nYPG forces as well as later the broader Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have clashed heavily with Islamist forces of all stripes in the following years, in particular with those representing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Most notable have been the Siege of Koban\u00ee (2014), the Al-Hasakah offensive (February\u2013March 2015), the Al-Hasakah offensive (May 2015), the Tell Abyad offensive (May\u2013July 2015), the Battle of Sarrin (June\u2013July 2015), the Battle of Al-Hasakah (June\u2013August 2015), and the ongoing Raqqa campaign (2016\u2013present) including the Battle of Tabqa (2017).\n\nTurkey has long regarded the PYD as an alleged Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and has therefore taken a hardline stance against the group, the official talking point being that it would not allow a Kurdish state to form along their southern border with Syria. Turkey's policy towards Rojava is based on an economic blockade,[75] persistent attempts of international isolation,[76] opposition to the cooperation of the international Anti-ISIL-coalition with Rojava militias,[77] and support of Islamist Syrian Civil War parties hostile towards Rojava,[78][79] in past times even including ISIL.[80][81][82] Turkey has on several occasions been militarily attacking Rojava territory and defence forces.[83][84][85] The latter has resulted in some of the most clearcut instances of international solidarity with Rojava.[86][87][88][89]\n\nTurkey has received PYD co-chair Salih Muslim for talks in 2013[90] and in 2014,[91] even entertaining the idea of opening a Rojava representation office in Ankara \"if it's suitable with Ankara's policies\".[92] Turkey recognizes the PYD and the YPG militia as identical to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),[93][94][95][96] which is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the European Union, the United States and others. However, the EU, the US, and others cooperate with the PYD and the YPG militia in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and do not consider either a terrorist organisation.[97] About its loss in international standing, the consequence of domestic and foreign policies of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish government is contemptuous.[98][99][100] The Turkish foreign minister called the PYD a \"terrorist organisation\" in his speech at the meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers of the 13th Islamic Summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on 12 April 2016 at Istanbul, Turkey.[76] In November 2016 official Anadolu Agency accused the educational institutions of Rojava of \"prejudice against Islam\".[101] U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter admitted to links between the PYD, the YPG, and the PKK.[102][103][104] Secretary Carter replied, \"Yes,\" to a Senate panel when Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) asked whether he believed the Syrian Kurds are \"aligned or at least have substantial ties to the PKK\".[105] Rojava and YPG leaders insist that the PKK is a separate organization.[106] YPG representatives have persistently reiterated that their militia has an all Syrian agenda and no agenda of hostility whatsoever towards Turkey.[107] However, according to the Turkish Daily Sabah, at one occasion in January 2016 \"a YouTube video has appeared of an English-speaking man, believed to be a fighter from the Democratic Union Party's (PYD) armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG) (...) making a call for Westerners to join the ranks of the armed group and conduct terrorist attacks against the Turkish state.\"[108] In the perception of much of the Turkish public, the Rojava federal project as well as U.S. support for the YPG against ISIL are elements of a wider conspiracy scheme by a \"mastermind\" with the aim to weaken or even dismember Turkey, in order to prevent its imminent rise as a global power.[109]\n\nFollowing major YPG successes in 2015, notably the capture of Tell Abyad, Turkey began indiscriminately targeting YPG forces in northern Syria.[5] Since 16 February 2016, Turkish forces have been shelling Kurdish forces in the Afrin Canton after the SDF took initiative from an SAA offensive and captured rebel-held areas of the Azaz District, notably Tell Rifaat and Menagh Airbase. Turkey has vowed not to allow the SDF to capture the key border town of Azaz. As a result, 25 Kurdish militants have been killed and 197 injured from Turkish artillery fire.[110] In early 2016, following the capture of Tishrin Dam, allowing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to cross the River Euphrates, a proclaimed 'red line' by Turkey. Turkish forces bombed the Kurdish YPG headquarters in Tell Abyad, destroying three armoured vehicles and injuring two Kurdish fighters.[111] The following day, 21 January 2016, Turkish troops crossed the border with Syria and entered the ISIS-controlled Syrian border town of Jarabulus which the YPG had been planning on capturing as part of an offensive to unite their areas of control into one continuous banner of territory. Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria said Turkish airstrikes hit their bases in Amarneh village near Jarablus on 27 August 2016, after Turkish artillery shelled the positions the day before.[112] The Syrian Observatory reported on 27 August 2016, about exchange of gunfire between YPG and the Turkish forces in the countryside north of Hasakah. It is unclear if Turkish forces were on Syrian territory or had fired across the border.[113]\n\nIn March 2017, U.S. Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend said \"I have seen absolutely zero evidence that they have been a threat to, or have supported any attacks on, Turkey from Northern Syria over the last two years.\" The top U.S. commander in the campaign against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) argued that the Peoples\u2019 Protection Units (YPG), the military wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), does not pose a threat to Turkey. \"Of those YPG fighters, I\u2019ve talked to their leaders and we\u2019ve watched them operate and they continually reassure us that they have no desire to attack Turkey, that they are not a threat to Turkey, in fact that they desire to have a good working relationship with Turkey.\"[114]"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution": {"title": "Cuban Revolution - Wikipedia", "keywords": [""], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution", "text": "The Cuban Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n cubana) was an armed revolt conducted by Fidel Castro's revolutionary 26th of July Movement and its allies against the authoritarian government of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista. The revolution began in July 1953,[4] and continued sporadically until the rebels finally ousted Batista on 1 January 1959, replacing his government with a revolutionary socialist state. The 26th of July Movement later reformed along communist lines, becoming the Communist Party in October 1965.[5]\n\nThe Cuban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In particular, it transformed Cuba's relationship with the United States, although efforts to improve diplomatic relations have gained momentum in recent years.[6][7][8][9] In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization and political consolidation that transformed Cuba's economy and civil society.[10][11] The revolution also heralded an era of Cuban intervention in foreign military conflicts, including the Angolan Civil War and the Nicaraguan Revolution.[12]\n\nIn the decades following United States' invasion of Cuba in 1898, and formal independence from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, Cuba experienced a period of significant instability, enduring a number of revolts, coups and a period of U.S. military occupation. Fulgencio Batista, a former soldier who had served as the elected president of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, became president for the second time in 1952, after seizing power in a military coup and canceling the 1952 elections.[13] Although Batista had been relatively progressive during his first term,[14] in the 1950s he proved far more dictatorial and indifferent to popular concerns.[15] While Cuba remained plagued by high unemployment and limited water infrastructure,[16] Batista antagonized the population by forming lucrative links to organized crime and allowing American companies to dominate the Cuban economy.[16][17][18] Although the US armed and politically supported the Batista dictatorship, later US presidents recognized its corruption and the justifiability of removing it.[19]\n\nDuring his first term as President, Batista had been supported by the Communist Party of Cuba,[14] but during his second term he became strongly anti-communist, gaining him political and military support from the United States.[16][20] Batista developed a powerful security infrastructure to silence political opponents. In the months following the March 1952 coup, Fidel Castro, then a young lawyer and activist, petitioned for the overthrow of Batista, whom he accused of corruption and tyranny. However, Castro's constitutional arguments were rejected by the Cuban courts.[21] After deciding that the Cuban regime could not be replaced through legal means, Castro resolved to launch an armed revolution. To this end, he and his brother Ra\u00fal founded a paramilitary organization known as \"The Movement\", stockpiling weapons and recruiting around 1,200 followers from Havana's disgruntled working class by the end of 1952.[22]\n\nStriking their first blow against the Batista government, Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro gathered 123 Movement fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on several military installations.[23] On 26 July 1953, the rebels attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago and the barracks in Bayamo, only to be decisively defeated by government soldiers.[4] It was hoped that the staged attack would spark a nationwide revolt against Batista's government. He had around 150 factory and farm workers. After an hour of fighting the rebel leader fled to the mountains.[24] The exact number of rebels killed in the battle is debatable; however, in his autobiography, Fidel Castro claimed that nine were killed in the fighting, and an additional 56 were executed after being captured by the Batista government.[25] Due to the government's large number of men, Hunt revised the number to be around 60 members taking the opportunity to flee to the mountains along with Castro.[26] Among the dead was Abel Santamar\u00eda, Castro's second-in-command, who was imprisoned, tortured, and executed on the same day as the attack.[27]\n\nNumerous key Movement revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, were captured shortly afterwards. In a highly political trial, Fidel spoke for nearly four hours in his defense, ending with the words \"Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me.\" Castro's defense was based on nationalism, the representation and beneficial programs for the non-elite Cubans, and his patriotism and justice for the Cuban community.[28] Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in the Presidio Modelo prison, located on Isla de Pinos, while Ra\u00fal was sentenced to 13 years.[29] However, in 1955, under broad political pressure, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada attackers. Fidel's Jesuit childhood teachers succeeded in persuading Batista to include Fidel and Ra\u00fal in the release.[30]\n\nSoon, the Castro brothers joined with other exiles in Mexico to prepare for the overthrow of Batista, receiving training from Alberto Bayo, a leader of Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. In June 1955, Fidel met the Argentine revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, who joined his cause.[30] Raul and Castro's chief advisor Ernesto aided the initiation of Batista's amnesty.[28] The revolutionaries named themselves the \"26th of July Movement\", in reference to the date of their attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953.\n\nThe yacht Granma departed from Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico, on 25 November 1956, carrying the Castro brothers and 80 others including Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos, even though the yacht was only designed to accommodate 12 people with a maxiumum of 25. The yacht arrived in Cuba on 2 December.[32] The boat landed in Playa Las Coloradas, in the municipality of Niquero, arriving two days later than planned because the boat was heavily loaded, unlike during the practice sailing runs.[33] This dashed any hopes for a coordinated attack with the llano wing of the Movement. After arriving and exiting the ship, the band of rebels began to make their way into the Sierra Maestra mountains, a range in southeastern Cuba. Three days after the trek began, Batista's army attacked and killed most of the Granma participants \u2013 while the exact number is disputed, no more than twenty of the original eighty-two men survived the initial encounters with the Cuban army and escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains.[34]\n\nThe group of survivors included Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. The dispersed survivors, alone or in small groups, wandered through the mountains, looking for each other. Eventually, the men would link up again \u2013 with the help of peasant sympathizers \u2013 and would form the core leadership of the guerrilla army. A number of female revolutionaries, including Celia Sanchez and Hayd\u00e9e Santamar\u00eda (the sister of Abel Santamaria), also assisted Fidel Castro's operations in the mountains.[35]\n\nOn 13 March 1957, a separate group of revolutionaries \u2013 the anticommunist Student Revolutionary Directorate (RD) (Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil, DRE), composed mostly of students \u2013 stormed the Presidential Palace in Havana, attempting to assassinate Batista and decapitate the government. The attack ended in utter failure. The RD's leader, student Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda, died in a shootout with Batista's forces at the Havana radio station he had seized to spread the news of Batista's anticipated death. The handful of survivors included Dr. Humberto Castello (who later became the Inspector General in the Escambray), Rolando Cubela and Faure Chomon (both later Commandantes of the 13 March Movement, centered in the Escambray Mountains of Las Villas Province).[36]\n\nThereafter, the United States imposed an economic embargo on the Cuban government and recalled its ambassador, weakening the government's mandate further.[37] Batista's support among Cubans began to fade, with former supporters either joining the revolutionaries or distancing themselves from Batista. Once Batista started making drastic decisions concerning Cuba's economy, he began to nationalize U.S oil refineries and other U.S properties.[38] Nonetheless, the Mafia and U.S. businessmen maintained their support for the regime.[39][40]\n\nBatista's government often resorted to brutal methods to keep Cuba's cities under control. However, in the Sierra Maestra mountains, Castro, aided by Frank Pa\u00eds, Ramos Latour, Huber Matos, and many others, staged successful attacks on small garrisons of Batista's troops. In addition, poorly armed irregulars known as escopeteros harassed Batista's forces in the foothills and plains of Oriente Province. The escopeteros also provided direct military support to Castro's main forces by protecting supply lines and by sharing intelligence.[41] Ultimately, the mountains came under Castro's control.\n\nIn addition to armed resistance, the rebels sought to use propaganda to their advantage. A pirate radio station called Radio Rebelde (\"Rebel Radio\") was set up in February 1958, allowing Castro and his forces to broadcast their message nationwide within enemy territory.[42] Castro's affiliation with the New York Times journalist Herbert Matthews created a front page-worthy report on anti-communist propaganda.[43] The radio broadcasts were made possible by Carlos Franqui, a previous acquaintance of Castro who subsequently became a Cuban exile in Puerto Rico.[44]\n\nDuring this time, Castro's forces remained quite small in numbers, sometimes fewer than 200 men, while the Cuban army and police force had a manpower of around 37,000.[45] Even so, nearly every time the Cuban military fought against the revolutionaries, the army was forced to retreat. An arms embargo \u2013 imposed on the Cuban government by the United States on 14 March 1958 \u2013 contributed significantly to the weakness of Batista's forces. The Cuban air force rapidly deteriorated: it could not repair its airplanes without importing parts from the United States.[46]\n\nBatista finally responded to Castro's efforts with an attack on the mountains called Operation Verano, known to the rebels as la Ofensiva. The army sent some 12,000 soldiers, half of them untrained recruits, into the mountains, along with his own brother Raul. In a series of small skirmishes, Castro's determined guerrillas defeated the Cuban army.[46] In the Battle of La Plata, which lasted from 11 July to 21 July 1958, Castro's forces defeated a 500-man battalion, capturing 240 men while losing just three of their own.[47]\n\nHowever, the tide nearly turned on 29 July 1958, when Batista's troops almost destroyed Castro's small army of some 300 men at the Battle of Las Mercedes. With his forces pinned down by superior numbers, Castro asked for, and received, a temporary cease-fire on 1 August. Over the next seven days, while fruitless negotiations took place, Castro's forces gradually escaped from the trap. By 8 August, Castro's entire army had escaped back into the mountains, and Operation Verano had effectively ended in failure for the Batista government.[46]\n\nOn 21 August 1958, after the defeat of Batista's Ofensiva, Castro's forces began their own offensive. In the Oriente province (in the area of the present-day provinces of Santiago de Cuba, Granma, Guant\u00e1namo and Holgu\u00edn), Fidel Castro, Ra\u00fal Castro and Juan Almeida Bosque directed attacks on four fronts. Descending from the mountains with new weapons captured during the Ofensiva and smuggled in by plane, Castro's forces won a series of initial victories. Castro's major victory at Guisa, and the successful capture of several towns including Maffo, Contramaestre, and Central Oriente, brought the Cauto plains under his control.\n\nMeanwhile, three rebel columns, under the command of Che Guevara, Camilo Cienfuegos and Jaime Vega, proceeded westward toward Santa Clara, the capital of Villa Clara Province. Batista's forces ambushed and destroyed Jaime Vega's column, but the surviving two columns reached the central provinces, where they joined forces with several other resistance groups not under the command of Castro. When Che Guevara's column passed through the province of Las Villas, and specifically through the Escambray Mountains \u2013 where the anticommunist Revolutionary Directorate forces (who became known as the 13 March Movement) had been fighting Batista's army for many months \u2013 friction developed between the two groups of rebels. Nonetheless, the combined rebel army continued the offensive, and Cienfuegos won a key victory in the Battle of Yaguajay on 30 December 1958, earning him the nickname \"The Hero of Yaguajay\".\n\nOn 31 December 1958, the Battle of Santa Clara took place in a scene of great confusion. The city of Santa Clara fell to the combined forces of Che Guevara, Cienfuegos, and Revolutionary Directorate (RD) rebels led by Comandantes Rolando Cubela, Juan (\"El Mejicano\") Abrahantes, and William Alexander Morgan. News of these defeats caused Batista to panic. He fled Cuba by air for the Dominican Republic just hours later on 1 January 1959. Comandante William Alexander Morgan, leading RD rebel forces, continued fighting as Batista departed, and had captured the city of Cienfuegos by 2 January.[49]\n\nCastro learned of Batista's flight in the morning and immediately started negotiations to take over Santiago de Cuba. On the 2nd of January, the military commander in the city, Colonel Rubido, ordered his soldiers not to fight, and Castro's forces took over the city. The forces of Guevara and Cienfuegos entered Havana at about the same time. They had met no opposition on their journey from Santa Clara to Cuba's capital. Castro himself arrived in Havana on 8 January after a long victory march. His initial choice of president, Manuel Urrutia Lle\u00f3, took office on 3 January.[50]\n\nThe importance of women\u2019s contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the Moncada Barracks, to the Mariana Grajales all-women's platoon that served as Fidel Castro's personal security detail. Tete Puebla, second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, has said:\n\n\"Women in Cuba have always been on the front line of the struggle. At Moncada we had Yeye (Haydee Santamaria) and Melba (Hernandez). With the Granma (yacht) and November 30, we had Celia, Vilma, and many other compa\u00f1eras. There were many women comrades who were tortured and murdered. From the beginning there were women in the Revolutionary Armed Forces. First they were simple soldiers, later sergeants. Those of us in the Mariana Grajales Platoon were the first officers. The ones who ended the war with officers\u2019 ranks stayed in the armed forces.\" [51]\n\nBefore the Mariana Grajales Platoon was established, the revolutionary women of the Sierra Maestra were not organized for combat and primarily helped with cooking, mending clothes, and tending to the sick, frequently acting as couriers, as well as teaching guerillas to read and write.[52] Hayd\u00e9e Santamar\u00eda and Melba Hernandez were the only women who participated in the attack on the Moncada Barracks, afterward acting alongside Natalia Revuelta, and Lidia Castro (Fidel Castro\u2019s sister) to form alliances with anti-Batista organizations, as well as the assembly and distribution of \u201cHistory Will Absolve Me\u201d.[53] Celia Sanchez and Vilma Espin were leading strategists and highly skilled combatants who held essential roles throughout the revolution. Tete Puebla, founding member and second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, said of Celia Sanchez, \u201cWhen you speak of Celia, you\u2019ve got to speak of Fidel, and vice versa. Celia\u2019s ideas touched almost everything in the Sierra.[51]\n\nOn 15 April 1959, Castro began an 11-day visit to the United States, at the invitation of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.[55] He said during his visit: \"I know the world thinks of us, we are Communists, and of course I have said very clear that we are not Communists; very clear.\"[56]\n\nHundreds of Batista-era agents, policemen and soldiers were put on public trial, accused of human rights abuses, war crimes, murder, and torture. About 200 of the accused people were convicted of political crimes by revolutionary tribunals and then executed by firing squad; others received long sentences of imprisonment. A notable example of revolutionary justice occurred after the capture of Santiago, where Ra\u00fal Castro directed the execution of more than seventy Batista POWs.[57] For his part in taking Havana, Che Guevara was appointed supreme prosecutor in La Caba\u00f1a Fortress. This was part of a large-scale attempt by Fidel Castro to cleanse the security forces of Batista loyalists and potential opponents of the new revolutionary government. Though many were killed or imprisoned, others were fortunate enough to be dismissed from the army and police without prosecution, and some high-ranking officials of the Batista administration were exiled as military attach\u00e9s.[57] Most scholars agree that those executed were probably guilty as accused, but the trials did not follow due process.[58]\n\nDuring its first decade in power, the Castro government introduced a wide range of progressive social reforms. Laws were introduced to provide equality for black Cubans and greater rights for women, while there were attempts to improve communications, medical facilities, health, housing, and education. In addition, there were touring cinemas, art exhibitions, concerts, and theatres. By the end of the 1960s, all Cuban children were receiving some education (compared with less than half before 1959), unemployment and corruption were reduced, and great improvements were made in hygiene and sanitation.[59]\n\nAccording to geographer and Cuban Comandante Antonio N\u00fa\u00f1ez Jim\u00e9nez, 75% of Cuba's best arable land was owned by foreign individuals or foreign (mostly American) companies at the time of the revolution. One of the first policies of the newly formed Cuban government was eliminating illiteracy and implementing land reforms. Land reform efforts helped to raise living standards by subdividing larger holdings into cooperatives. Comandante Sori Marin, who was nominally in charge of land reform, objected and fled, but was eventually executed when he returned to Cuba with arms and explosives, intending to overthrow the Castro government.[60][61]\n\nShortly after taking power, Castro also created a revolutionary militia to expand his power base among the former rebels and the supportive population. Castro also created the informant Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) in late September 1960. Local CDRs were tasked with keeping \"vigilance against counter-revolutionary activity\", keeping a detailed record of each neighborhood's inhabitants' spending habits, level of contact with foreigners, work and education history, and any \"suspicious\" behavior.[62] Among the increasingly persecuted groups were homosexual men.[63]\n\nIn February 1959, the Ministry for the Recovery of Misappropriated Assets (Ministerio de Recuperaci\u00f3n de Bienes Malversados) was created. Cuba began expropriating land and private property under the auspices of the Agrarian Reform Law of 17 May 1959. Farms of any size could be and were seized by the government, while land, businesses, and companies owned by upper- and middle-class Cubans were nationalized (notably, including the plantations owned by Fidel Castro's family). By the end of 1960, the revolutionary government had nationalized more than $25 billion worth of private property owned by Cubans.[10] The Castro government formally nationalized all foreign-owned property, particularly American holdings, in the nation on 6 August 1960.[11]\n\nIn 1961, the Cuban government nationalized all property held by religious organizations, including the dominant Roman Catholic Church. Hundreds of members of the church, including a bishop, were permanently expelled from the nation, as the new Cuban government declared itself officially atheist. Education also saw significant changes \u2013 private schools were banned and the progressively socialist state assumed greater responsibility for children.[64] The Cuban government also began to expropriate from mafia leaders and taking millions in cash. Before Meyer Lansky fled Cuba, he was said to be worth an estimated $20M, that would be $163,685,121 in 2016. When he died in 1983, his family was shocked that his estate was worth less than $10K. Before he died Lansky said Cuba \u201cruined\u201d him.[65]\n\nIn July 1961, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (IRO) was formed by the merger of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement, the People's Socialist Party led by Blas Roca, and the Revolutionary Directorate of 13 March led by Faure Chom\u00f3n.[66] On 26 March 1962, the IRO became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) which, in turn, became the modern Communist Party of Cuba on 3 October 1965, with Castro as First Secretary. Castro remained the ruler of Cuba, first as Prime Minister and, from 1976, as President, until his retirement in February 2008.[67] His brother Ra\u00fal officially replaced him as President later that same month.[68]\n\nThe Cuban Revolution was a crucial turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations. Although the American government was initially willing to recognize Castro's new government,[70] it soon came to fear that Communist insurgencies would spread through the nations of Latin America, as they had in Southeast Asia.[71] Castro, meanwhile, resented the Americans for providing aid to Batista's government during the revolution.[70] After the revolutionary government nationalized all U.S. property in Cuba in August 1960, the American Eisenhower administration froze all Cuban assets on American soil, severed diplomatic ties and tightened its embargo of Cuba.[6][11][72] In 1961, the U.S. government backed an armed counterrevolutionary assault on the Bay of Pigs with the aim of ousting Castro, but the counterrevolutionaries were swiftly defeated by the Cuban military.[71] The American embargo against Cuba \u2013 the longest-lasting single foreign policy in American history[73] \u2013 is still in force as of 2017, although it has undergone a partial loosening in recent years.[6] The U.S. began efforts to normalize relations with Cuba in the mid-2010s,[8][74] and formally reopened its embassy in Havana after over half a century in August 2015.[9]\n\nCastro's victory and post-revolutionary foreign policy had global repercussions. Influenced by the expansion of the Soviet Union into Europe after the 1917 Russian Revolution, Castro immediately sought to \"export\" his revolution to other countries in the Caribbean and beyond, sending weapons to Algerian rebels as early as 1960.[12] In the following decades, Cuba became heavily involved in supporting Communist insurgencies and independence movements in many developing countries, sending military aid to insurgents in Ghana, Nicaragua, Yemen and Angola, among others.[12] Castro's intervention in the Angolan Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s was particularly significant, involving as many as 60,000 Cuban soldiers.[12][75]\n\nFollowing the American embargo, the Soviet Union became Cuba's main ally.[11] The two Communist countries quickly developed close military and intelligence ties, culminating in the stationing of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba in 1962, an act which triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis. Cuba maintained close links to the Soviets until the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. The end of Soviet economic aid led to an economic crisis and famine known as the Special Period in Cuba.[76]\n\nIn the wake of the revolution, thousands of disaffected anti-Batista rebels, former Batista supporters, and campesinos (peasants) fled to Cuba's Las Villas province, where an anticommunist underground had been forming since early 1960. Operating out of the Escambray Mountains, these counterrevolutionary rebels, also known as Alzados, made a number of unsuccessful attempts to overthrow the Cuban government, including the abortive, United States-backed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961.[71] In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the United States promised not to invade Cuba in the future; in compliance with this agreement, the U.S. withdrew all support from the Alzados, effectively crippling the resource-starved resistance.[77] The counterrevolutionary conflict, known abroad as the Escambray Rebellion, lasted until about 1965, and has since been branded the War Against the Bandits by the Cuban government.[77]\n\nBetween 1959 and 1980, an estimated 500,000 Cubans left the island for the United States, for both political and economic reasons; 125,000 left in 1980 alone, when the Cuban government briefly permitted any Cubans who wished to leave to do so.[78] By 2010, the Cuban American community numbered over 1.9 million, 67% of whom lived in the state of Florida.[79] As a voting bloc, Cuban Americans have traditionally been strongly opposed to ending the U.S. embargo of Cuba, but in recent years there has been growing support for diplomatic engagement among the younger generations.[80]"}, "http://archive.is/viyU0#selection-661.0-667.287": {"title": "Anti Communist Action", "keywords": ["anti-communist", " right-wing", " antifa", " america"], "url": "http://archive.is/viyU0#selection-661.0-667.287", "text": "Anticom\u2019s mission is to defend our communities from radical political violence by physically resisting leftist terrorists and rioters.\n\nAnticom members are held to high standards of physical and mental readiness.

Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the right-controlled Congress of Chile and the socialist President Salvador Allende, as well as economic warfare ordered by U.S. President Richard Nixon,[6] Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police.[7][8]\n\nThe military deposed Allende's Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially the communist and socialist parties and the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). Allende's appointed army chief, Augusto Pinochet, rose to supreme power within a year of the coup, formally assuming power in late 1974.[9] The United States government, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup,[10] promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power.[11]\n\nDuring the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup, Allende gave his last speech, in which he vowed to stay in the presidential palace, refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation.[12] Direct witness accounts of Allende's death agree that he killed himself in the palace.[13][14]\n\nBefore the coup, Chile had for decades been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability while the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and Caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932.[15] Historian Peter Winn characterized the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in Chile's history.[16] A weak insurgent movement against the Pinochet regime was maintained inside Chile by elements sympathetic to the former Allende government. An internationally supported plebiscite in 1988 led Pinochet to relinquish power.\n\nAllende contested the 1970 Chilean presidential election with Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez of the National Party and Radomiro Tomic of the Christian Democratic Party. Allende received 36.6% of the vote. Alessandri was a very close second with 35.3%, and Tomic third with 28.1%.[17] Although Allende received the highest number of votes, according to the Chilean constitution and since none of the candidates won by an absolute majority, the National Congress had to decide among the candidates.[18]\n\nThe Chilean constitution did not allow a person to sit as president for two consecutive terms so the incumbent president, Eduardo Frei Montalva, was thus ineligible as a candidate. The CIA's \"Track I\" operation was a plan to influence the Congress to choose Alessandri, who would resign after a short time in office, forcing a second election. Frei would then be eligible to run.[19] Alessandri announced on 9 September that if Congress chose him, he would resign. Congress then decided on Allende. Soon after hearing news of his win, Allende signed a Statute of Constitutional Guarantees, which stated that he would follow the constitution during his presidency.[20]\n\nThe U.S. feared the example of a \"well-functioning socialist experiment\" on the region and exerted diplomatic, economic, and covert pressure upon Chile's elected socialist government.[21][22][23] At the end of 1971, the Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro made a four-week state visit to Chile, alarming Western observers worried about the \"Chilean Way to Socialism\".[24]\n\nIn 1972, economics minister Pedro Vuskovic adopted monetary policies that increased the amount of circulating currency and devalued the escudo, which increased inflation to 140 percent in 1972 and engendered a black market economy.[25]\n\nIn October 1972, Chile suffered the first of many strikes. Among the participants were small-scale businessmen, some professional unions, and student groups. Its leaders \u2013 Vilar\u00edn, Jaime Guzm\u00e1n, Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton, Eduardo Arriagada \u2013 expected to depose the elected government. Other than damaging the national economy, the principal effect of the 24-day strike was drawing Army head, Gen. Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister, an appeasement to the right wing.[25] (Gen. Prats had succeeded Army head Gen. Ren\u00e9 Schneider after his assassination on 24 October 1970 by a group led by Gen. Roberto Viaux, whom the Central Intelligence Agency had not attempted to discourage.) Gen. Prats supported the legalist Schneider Doctrine and refused military involvement in a coup d'\u00e9tat against President Allende.[26]\n\nDespite the declining economy, President Allende's Popular Unity coalition increased its vote to 43.2% in the March 1973 parliamentary elections; but, by then, the informal alliance between Popular Unity and the Christian Democrats ended.[27] The Christian Democrats allied with the right-wing National Party, who were opposed to Allende's government; the two right-wing parties formed the Confederation of Democracy (CODE). The internecine parliamentary conflict, between the legislature and the executive branch, paralyzed the activities of government.[28] The CIA paid some U.S. $6.8\u2013$8 million to right-wing opposition groups to \"create pressures, exploit weaknesses, magnify obstacles\" and hasten Allende's ouster.[29][30][31]\n\nAllende began to fear his opponents, convinced they were plotting his assassination. Using his daughter as a messenger, he explained the situation to Fidel Castro. Castro gave four pieces of advice: convince technicians to stay in Chile, only sell copper for US dollars, avoid extreme revolutionary acts which would give opponents an excuse to wreck or control the economy, and maintain a proper relationship with the Chilean military until local militias could be established and consolidated. Allende attempted to follow Castro's advice, but the latter two recommendations proved difficult.[32]\n\nPrior to the coup, the Chilean military had undergone a process of de-politicization since the 1920s, when military personnel participated in government positions. Subsequently, most military officers remained under-funded having only subsistence salaries. Because of the low salaries the military spent much time in military leisure-time facilities (e.g. country clubs) where they met other officers and their families. The military remained apart from society, being to some degree an endogamous group as officers frequently married the sisters of their comrades or the daughters of high-ranked older officers. Many officers had also relatives in the military.[33] In 1969 elements of the military made their first act of rebellion in 40 years when they participated in the Tacnazo. The Tacnazo was not a proper coup but a protest against under-funding.[34] In retrospect General Carlos Prats considered that Christian Democrats who were in power in 1969 committed the error of not taking the militaries grievances seriously.[35]\n\nGovernments of Argentina (1966), Bolivia (1969), Brazil (1964) and Peru (1968) were all overthrown in coups and replaced by military governments.[36] In June 1973 Uruguay joined the coup d'\u00e9tat wave that swept through the region.[37] The poor conditions of the Chilean military contrasted with the change of fortune the military of neighboring countries experienced as they came to power in coups.[36]\n\nDuring the decades previous to the coup, the military became influenced by the United States' anti-communist ideology in the context of various cooperation programs including the US Army School of the Americas.[33]\n\nOn 29 June 1973, Colonel Roberto Souper surrounded the La Moneda presidential palace with his tank regiment and failed to depose the Allende Government.[38] That failed coup d\u2019\u00e9tat \u2013 known as the Tanquetazo tank putsch \u2013 organized by the nationalist \"Fatherland and Liberty\" paramilitary group.\n\nIn August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred; the Supreme Court publicly complained about the government's inability to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats united with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.[28]\n\nFor months, the government had feared calling upon the Carabineros national police, suspecting them of disloyalty. On 9 August, Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. He was forced to resign both as defence minister and as the Army commander-in-chief on 24 August 1973, embarrassed by the Alejandrina Cox incident and a public protest of the wives of his generals at his house. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.[28] In late August 1973, 100,000[disputed \u2013 discuss] Chilean women congregated at Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n to protest against the government for the rising cost and increasing shortages of food and fuels, but they were dispersed with tear gas.[39]\n\nOn 22 August 1973, with the support of the Christian Democrats and National Party members, the Chamber of Deputies passed 81\u201347 a resolution that asked \"the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces\"[40] to \"put an immediate end\" to \"breach[es of] the Constitution . . . with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans.\"\n\nThe resolution declared that the Allende Government sought \". . . to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State . . . [with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system\", claiming it had made \"violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct.\" Essentially, most of the accusations were about the government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks.\n\nIt can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow the government if it did not comply, as follows \"...To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law.\"[41]\n\nTwo days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the Congress' declaration as \"destined to damage the country\u2019s prestige abroad and create internal confusion\", predicting \"It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors\". He noted that the declaration had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority \"constitutionally required\" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress was \"invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government\" and \"subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will\".[42]\n\nAllende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet \"at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism\". In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or a civil war with a declaration \"full of affirmations that had already been refuted before-hand\" and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.\n\nPresident Allende wrote: \"Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives\".\n\nAdding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said means\u2014having already \"paralyzed\" the State\u2014they sought to \"destroy\" it. He concluded by calling upon \"the workers, all democrats and patriots\" to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the \"revolutionary process\".[42]\n\nMany people in different parts of the world immediately suspected U.S. of foul play. In early newspaper reports, the U.S. denied any involvement or previous knowledge of the coup.[45][46] Prompted by an incriminating New York Times article, the U.S. Senate opened an investigation into possible U.S. interference in Chile.[46] A report prepared by the United States Intelligence Community in 2000, at the direction of the National Intelligence Council, that echoed the Church committee, states that\n\nThe report stated that the CIA \"actively supported the military Junta after the overthrow of Allende but did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency.\"[47] After a review of recordings of telephone conversations between Nixon and Henry Kissinger, Robert Dallek concluded that both of them used the CIA to actively destabilize the Allende government. In one particular conversation about the news of Allende's overthrow, Kissinger complains about the lack of recognition of the American role in the overthrow of a \"communist\" government, upon which Nixon remarked, \"Well, we didn't \u2013 as you know \u2013 our hand doesn't show on this one.\".[48] A later CIA report contended that US agents maintained close ties with the Chilean military to collect intelligence but no effort was made to assist them and \"under no circumstances attempted to influence them.\"[31]\n\nHistorian Peter Winn found \"extensive evidence\" of United States complicity in the coup. He states that its covert support was crucial to engineering the coup, as well as for the consolidation of power by the Pinochet regime following the takeover. Winn documents an extensive CIA operation to fabricate reports of a coup against Allende, as justification for the imposition of military rule.[10] Peter Kornbluh asserts that the CIA destabilized Chile and helped create the conditions for the coup, citing documents declassified by the Clinton administration.[49] Other authors point to the involvement of the Defense Intelligence Agency, agents of which allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard the La Moneda Palace.[50]\n\nThe U.S. Government's hostility to the election of Allende in Chile was substantiated in documents declassified during the Clinton administration, which show that CIA covert operatives were inserted in Chile in order to prevent a Marxist government from arising and for the purpose of spreading anti-Allende propaganda.[51] As described in the Church Committee report, the CIA was involved in multiple plots designed to remove Allende and then let the Chileans vote in a new election where he would not be a candidate. The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the Track I approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the 40 Committee, attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections.\n\nThe other approach of the CIA, also known as the Track II approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup by creating a climate of crisis across the country. False flag operatives contacted senior Chilean military officers and informed them that the U.S. would actively support a coup, but would revoke all military aid if such a coup did not happen.[49] In addition, the CIA gave extensive support for black propaganda against Allende, channeled mostly through El Mercurio. Financial assistance was also given to Allende's political opponents, and for organizing strikes and unrest to destabilize the government. By 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company ITT Corporation owned 70% of Chitelco (the Chilean Telephone Company), and also funded El Mercurio. The CIA used ITT as a means of disguising the source of the illegitimate funding Allende's opponents received.[52][53][54] On 28 September 1973, ITT's headquarters in New York City was bombed, allegedly for its involvement in Allende's overthrow.[55]\n\nAn Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) station was established in Chile out of the Australian embassy in July 1971 at the request of the CIA and authorised by then Liberal Party Foreign Minister William McMahon. New Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was informed of the operation in February 1973 and signed a document ordering the closure of the operation several weeks later. It appears, however, the last ASIS agent did not leave Chile until October 1973, one month after the CIA-backed coup d'\u00e9tat had brought down the Allende Government. There were also two officers of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), Australia's internal security service, who were based in Santiago working as migration officers during this period.[56][57] The failure of timely closure of Australia's covert operations was one of the reasons for the sacking of the Director of ASIS on 21 October 1975, to take effect on 7 November just four days before Prime Minister's Whitlam's own dismissal in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis with allegations of CIA political interference.[58]\n\nBy 7:00 am on 11 September 1973, the Navy captured Valpara\u00edso, strategically stationing ships and marine infantry in the central coast and closed radio and television networks. The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy's actions; immediately, the president went to the presidential palace with his bodyguards, the \"Group of Personal Friends\" (GAP). By 8:00 am, the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city; the Air Force bombed the remaining active stations; the President received incomplete information, and was convinced that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.\n\nPresident Allende and Defence minister Orlando Letelier were unable to communicate with military leaders. Admiral Montero, the Navy's commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut and his cars were sabotaged before the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to Jos\u00e9 Toribio Merino, planner of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and executive officer to Adm. Montero. Augusto Pinochet, General of the Army, and Gustavo Leigh, General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende's telephone calls to them. The General Director of the Carabineros (uniformed police), Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sep\u00falveda, and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), Alfredo Joignant answered Allende's calls and immediately went to the La Moneda presidential palace. When Defence minister Letelier arrived at the Ministry of Defense, controlled by Adm. Patricio Carvajal, he was arrested as the first prisoner of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\nDespite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet's loyalty, telling a reporter that the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30 am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military's rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.\n\nAt approx. 9:00 the carabineros of the La Moneda left the building.[59] By 9:00 am, the armed forces controlled Chile, except for the city centre of the capital, Santiago. Allende refused to surrender, despite the military's declaring they would bomb the La Moneda presidential palace if he resisted being deposed. The Socialist Party proposed to Allende that he escape to the San Joaqu\u00edn industrial zone in southern Santiago, to later re-group and lead a counter-coup d\u2019\u00e9tat; the president rejected the proposition. The military attempted negotiations with Allende, but the President refused to resign, citing his constitutional duty to remain in office. Finally, Allende gave a farewell speech, telling the nation of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and his refusal to resign his elected office under threat.\n\nLeigh ordered the presidential palace bombed, but was told the Air Force's Hawker Hunter jet aircraft would take forty minutes to arrive. Pinochet ordered an armoured and infantry force under General Sergio Arellano to advance upon the La Moneda presidential palace. When the troops moved forward, they were forced to retreat after coming under fire from GAP snipers perched on rooftops. General Arellano called for helicopter gunship support from the commander of the Chilean Army Puma helicopter squadron and the troops were able to advance again.[60] Chilean Air Force aircraft soon arrived to provide close air support for the assault (by bombing the Palace), but the defenders did not surrender until nearly 2:30 pm.[61] First reports said the 65-year-old president had died fighting troops, but later police sources reported he had committed suicide.\n\nIn the first months after the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, the military killed thousands of Chilean leftists, both real and suspected, or forced their \"disappearance\". The military imprisoned 40,000 political enemies in the National Stadium of Chile; among the tortured and killed desaparecidos (disappeared) were the U.S. citizens Charles Horman, and Frank Teruggi.[62] In October 1973, the Chilean songwriter V\u00edctor Jara, and 70 other political killings were perpetrated by the death squad, Caravan of Death (Caravana de la Muerte).\n\nThe government arrested some 130,000 people in a three-year period;[63][64] the dead and disappeared numbered thousands in the first months of the military government. Those include the British physician Sheila Cassidy, who survived to publicize to the UK the human rights violations in Chile.[65] Among those detained was Alberto Bachelet (father of future Chilean President Michelle Bachelet), an Air Force official; he was tortured and died on 12 March 1974,[66][67][68] the right-wing newspaper, El Mercurio (The Mercury),[69] reported that Mr Bachelet died after a basketball game, citing his poor cardiac health. Michelle Bachelet and her mother were imprisoned and tortured in the Villa Grimaldi detention and torture centre on 10 January 1975.[70][71][72][73]\n\nAfter Gen. Pinochet lost the election in the 1988 plebiscite, the Rettig Commission, a multi-partisan truth commission, in 1991 reported the location of torture and detention centers, among others, Colonia Dignidad, the tall ship Esmeralda and V\u00edctor Jara Stadium. Later, in November 2004, the Valech Report confirmed the number as less than 3,000 killed, and reduced the number of cases of forced disappearance; but some 28,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. Sixty individuals died as a direct result of fighting on 11 September, although the MIR and GAP continued to fight the following day. In all, 46 of Allende's guard (the GAP, Grupo de Amigos Personales) were killed, some of them in combat with the soldiers that took the Moneda.[74] Allende's Cuban-trained guard would have had about 300 elite commando-trained GAP fighters at the time of the coup,[75] but the use of brute military force, especially the use of Hawker Hunters, may have handicapped many GAP fighters from further action.[76]\n\nAccording to official reports prepared after the return of democracy, at La Moneda only two people died: President Allende and the journalist Augusto Olivares (both by suicide). Two more were injured, Antonio Aguirre and Osvaldo Ramos, both members of President Allende's entourage; they would later be allegedly kidnapped from the hospital and disappeared. In November 2006, the Associated Press noted that more than 15 bodyguards and aides were taken from the palace during the coup and are still unaccounted for; in 2006 Augusto Pinochet was indicted for two of their deaths.[77]\n\nOn the military side, there were 34 deaths: two army sergeants, three army corporals, four army privates, 2 navy lieutenants, 1 navy corporal, 4 naval cadets, 3 navy conscripts and 15 carabineros.[78] In mid-September, the Chilean military junta claimed its troops suffered another 16 dead and 100 injured by gunfire in mopping-up operations against Allende supporters, and Pinochet said: \"sadly there are still some armed groups who insist on attacking, which means that the military rules of wartime apply to them.\"[79] A press photographer also died in the crossfire while attempting to cover the event. On 23 October 1973, 23-year-old army corporal Benjam\u00edn Alfredo Jaramillo Ruz, who was serving with the Cazadores, became the first fatal casualty of the counterinsurgency operations in the mountainous area of Alquihue in Valdivia after being shot by a sniper.[80] The Chilean Army suffered 12 killed in various clashes with MIR guerrillas and GAP fighters in October 1973.[81]\n\nWhile fatalities in the battle during the coup might have been relatively small, the Chilean security forces sustained 162 dead in the three following months as a result of continued resistance,[82] and tens of thousands of people were arrested during the coup and held in the National Stadium.[83] This was because the plans for the coup called for the arrest of every man, woman and child on the streets the morning of 11 September. Of these approximately 40,000 to 50,000 perfunctory arrests, several hundred individuals would later be detained, questioned, tortured, and in some cases murdered.[citation needed] While these deaths did not occur before the surrender of Allende's forces, they occurred as a direct result of arrests and round-ups during the coup's military action.\n\nPresident Allende died in La Moneda during the coup. The junta officially declared that he committed suicide with a rifle given to him by Fidel Castro, two doctors from the infirmary of La Moneda stated that they witnessed the suicide,[84] and an autopsy labelled Allende's death a suicide. Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, one of the primary instigators of the coup, claimed that \"Allende committed suicide and is dead now.\"\n\nAt the time, few of Allende's supporters believed the explanation that Allende had killed himself.[85] Allende's body was exhumed in May 2011. A scientific autopsy was performed and the autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding on 19 July 2011 that Allende committed suicide using an AK-47 rifle.[86]\n\nHowever, on 31 May 2011, Chile's state television station reported that a top-secret military account of Allende's death had been discovered in the home of a former military justice official. The 300-page document was only found when the house was destroyed in the 2010 Chilean earthquake. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told TVN \"that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated.\"[21]\n\nAllende's widow and family escaped the military government and were accepted for exile in Mexico, where they remained for 17 years.[87][88]\n\nOn 13 September, the Junta dissolved Congress.[89] At the same time, it outlawed the parties that had been part of the Popular Unity coalition, and all political activity was declared \"in recess\".[90]\n\nThe military government took control of all media including the radio broadcasting that Allende attempted to use to give his final speech to the nation. It is not known how many Chileans actually heard the last words of Allende, as he spoke them but a transcript and audio of the speech survived the military government.[91][92] Chilean scholar Lidia M. Baltra details how the military took control of the media platforms and turned them into their own \"propaganda machine.\"[92] The only two newspapers that were allowed to continue publishing after the military takeover were El Mercurio and La Tercera de la Hora, both of which were anti-Allende under his leadership.[92] The dictatorship's silencing of the leftist point of view extended past the media and into \"every discourse that expressed any resistance to the regime.\"[93] An example of this is the torturing and death of folksinger Victor Jara. The military government detained Jara in the days following the coup. He, along with many other leftists, was held in Estadio Nacional, or the National Stadium of Chile in the capital of Santiago. IInitially, the Junta tried to silence him by crushing his hands but ultimately he was murdered.[94] Immediately after the coup the military sought after television host Don Francisco to have him report on the events. Don Francisco declined the offer encouraging the captain that had approached him to take the role of reporter himself.[95]\n\nInitially, there were four leaders of the junta: In addition to General Augusto Pinochet, from the Army, there were General Gustavo Leigh Guzm\u00e1n, of the Air Force; Admiral Jos\u00e9 Toribio Merino Castro, of the Navy (who replaced Constitutionalist Admiral Ra\u00fal Montero); and General Director C\u00e9sar Mendoza Dur\u00e1n, of the National Police (Carabineros de Chile) (who replaced Constitutionalist General Director Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sep\u00falveda). Coup leaders soon decided against a rotating presidency and named General Pinochet permanent head of the junta.[96]\n\nIn the months that followed the coup, the junta, with authoring work by historian Gonzalo Vial and admiral Patricio Carvajal, published a book titled El Libro Blanco del cambio de gobierno en Chile (commonly known as El Libro Blanco, \"The White Book of the Change of Government in Chile\"), where they attempted to justify the coup by claiming that they were in fact anticipating a self-coup (the alleged Plan Zeta, or Plan Z) that Allende's government or its associates were purportedly preparing. Historian Peter Winn states that the Central Intelligence Agency had an extensive part to play in fabricating the conspiracy and in selling it to the press, both in Chile and internationally.[10] Although later discredited and officially recognized as the product of political propaganda,[97] some Chilean historians pointed to the similarities between the alleged Plan Z and other existing paramilitary plans of the Popular Unity parties in support of its legitimacy.[98]\n\nThe newspaper La Tercera published on its front page a photograph showing prisoners at the Quiriquina Island Camp who had been captured during the fighting in Concepci\u00f3n. The photograph's caption stated that some of the detained were local leaders of the \"Unidad Popular\" while others were \"extremists who had attacked the armed forces with firearms\". The photo is reproduced in Docuscanner.[99] This is consistent with reports in newspapers and broadcasts in Concepci\u00f3n about the activities of the Armed Forces, which mentioned clashes with \"extremists\" on several occasions from 11 to 14 September. Nocturnal skirmishes took place around the Hotel Alonso De Ercilla in Colo Colo and San Martino Street, one block away from the Army and military police administrative headquarters. A recently published testimony about the clashes in Concepcion offers several plausible explanations for the reticence of witnesses to these actions.[100]\n\nBesides political leaders and participants, the coup also affected many everyday Chilean citizens. Thousands were killed, went missing, and were injured. Because of the political instability in their country, many relocated elsewhere. Canada, among other countries, became a main point of refuge for many Chilean citizens. Through an operation known as \u201cSpecial Movement Chile\u201d, more than 7,000 Chileans were relocated to Canada in the months following September 11, 1973.[101] These refugees are now known as Chilean Canadian people and have a population of over 38,000.[102]\n\nThe U.S. view of the coup continues to spark controversy. Beginning in late 2014 in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS), located at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints included that the Center knowingly protected a CHDS professor from Chile who was a former top advisor to Pinochet after belonging to the Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia Nacional / DINA state terrorist organization (whose attack against a former Chilean foreign minister in 1976 in Washington, D.C. resulted in two deaths, including that of an American). \u201cReports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extra-judicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the author of the \u201cLeahy Law\u201d prohibiting U.S. assistance to military units and members of foreign security forces that violate human rights.[103][104][105][106]\n\nRoberto Theime, the military leader of Fatherland and Liberty, who was imprisoned on September 11 was shocked to hear about the degree of violence the coup was carried out with. Despite being an arduous opponent of Unidad Popular he had expected a cleaner coup.[107]\n\nPresident of Argentina Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n condemned the coup calling it a \"fatality for the continent\". Before the coup Per\u00f3n had warned the more radical of his followers to stay calm and \"not do as Allende\".[108] Argentine students protested the coup at the Chilean embassy in Buenos Aires, where part of them chanted that they were \"available to cross the Andes\" (dispuestos a cruzar la cordillera).[109]\n\nThe commemoration of the coup is associated to competing narratives on its cause and effects.[110] The coup has been commemorated by detractors and supporters in various ways.\n\nOn September 11 of 1975 Pinochet lit the Llama de la Libertad (lit. Flame of Liberty) to commemorate the coup. This flame was extinguished in 2004.[111][112] Avenida Nueva Providencia in Providencia, Santiago, was renamed Avenida 11 de Septiembre in 1980.[113] In the 30th anniversary of the coup President Ricardo Lagos inaugurated the Morand\u00e9 80 entrance to La Moneda. This entrance to the presidential palace had been errased during the repairs the dictatorship did to the building after the bombing.[114]\n\nThe 40th anniversary of the coup in 2013 was particularly intense.[110] That year the name of Avenida 11 de Septiembre was reversed to the original Avenida Nueva Providencia.[113] The Association of Chilean Magistrates issued a public statement in early September 2013 recognizing the past unwillingness of judges to protect those persecuted by dictatorship.[110] On September 11, 2013 hundreds of Chileans posed as dead in the streets of Santiago in remembrance of the ones \"disappeared\" by the dictatorship.[115]\n\nThe centre-left opposition refused to attend the commemoration event organized by Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era's right-wing government organizing instead a separate event.[115] Osvaldo Andrade of the Socialist Party explained that attendance was not viable as Pi\u00f1era's government was \"packed with passive accomplices\" of the dictatorship.[116] Some right-wing politicians also declined the invitation.[117] President candidate Michelle Bachelet planned to spend the day visiting Museo de la Memoria and commented that \"it is not fair to talk about the coup as something unavoidable\".[117] President Pi\u00f1era held an unusual speech in which he denounced \"passive accomplices\" like news reporters who deliberately changed or omitted the truth and judges who rejected recursos de amparos that could have saved lives. People who knew things or could have known things but decided to stay quiet were also criticized as passive accomplices in Pi\u00f1era's speech.[110]\n\nA number of new films, theatre plays and photography expositions were held to cast light on the abuses and censorship of the dictatorship.[115] The number of new books published on the subject in 2013 was such that it constituted an editorial boom.[110][115] Conferences and seminaries on the subject of coup were also held. Various series and interviews with politicians on the subject of the coup and the dictatorship were aired on Chilean TV in 2013.[110]"}, "http://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year-survey-data-show-millions-of-workers-are-paid-less-than-the-minimum-wage-at-significant-cost-to-taxpayers-and-state-economies/": {"title": "Employers steal billions from workers\u2019 paychecks each year: Survey data show millions of workers are paid less than the minimum wage, at significant cost to taxpayers and state economies", "keywords": [""], "url": "http://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year-survey-data-show-millions-of-workers-are-paid-less-than-the-minimum-wage-at-significant-cost-to-taxpayers-and-state-economies/", "text": "What this report finds: This report assesses the prevalence and magnitude of one form of wage theft\u2014minimum wage violations (workers being paid at an effective hourly rate below the binding minimum wage)\u2014in the 10 most populous U.S. states. We find that, in these states, 2.4 million workers lose $8 billion annually (an average of $3,300 per year for year-round workers) to minimum wage violations\u2014nearly a quarter of their earned wages. This form of wage theft affects 17 percent of low-wage workers, with workers in all demographic categories being cheated out of pay.\n\nWhy it matters: Minimum wage violations, by definition, affect the lowest-wage workers\u2014those who can least afford to lose earnings. This form of wage theft causes many families to fall below the poverty line, and it increases workers\u2019 reliance on public assistance, costing taxpayers money. Lost wages can hurt state and local economies, and it hurts other workers in affected industries by putting downward pressure on wages.\n\nWhat can be done about it: Strengthen states\u2019 legal protections against wage theft, increase penalties for violators, bolster enforcement capacities, and protect workers from retaliation when violations are reported.\n\nFor the past four decades, the majority of American workers have been shortchanged by economic policymaking that has suppressed the growth of hourly wages and prevented greater improvements in living standards. Achieving a secure, middle-class lifestyle has become increasingly difficult as hourly pay for most workers has either stagnated or declined. For millions of the country\u2019s lowest-paid workers, financial security is even more fleeting because of unscrupulous employers stealing a portion of their paychecks.\n\nWage theft, the practice of employers failing to pay workers the full wages to which they are legally entitled, is a widespread and deep-rooted problem that directly harms millions of U.S. workers each year. Employers refusing to pay promised wages, paying less than legally mandated minimums, failing to pay for all hours worked, or not paying overtime premiums deprives working people of billions of dollars annually. It also leaves hundreds of thousands of affected workers and their families in poverty. Wage theft does not just harm the workers and families who directly suffer exploitation; it also weakens the bargaining power of workers more broadly by putting downward pressure on hourly wages in affected industries and occupations. For many low-income families who suffer wage theft, the resulting loss of income forces them to rely more heavily on public assistance programs, unduly straining safety net programs and hamstringing efforts to reduce poverty.\n\nResearchers have long known that measuring wage theft is challenging\u2014it takes many forms, violations are not always recognized or reported, and suitable public data sources are limited. Yet in recent years, several studies have attempted to better quantify the harm caused by wage theft. This study adds to those efforts by using data from the Current Population Survey to assess the prevalence and magnitude of wage theft in the form of minimum wage violations\u2014i.e., workers being paid at an effective hourly rate below the binding minimum wage. We look specifically at instances of such wage theft in the 10 most populous U.S. states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. We limit our focus to these 10 states so that we can carefully account for each state\u2019s individual minimum wage policies and state-specific exemptions to wage and hour laws. Data for the 10 most populous states also provide adequate sample sizes to describe the severity of minimum wage violations and the affected populations within each state. Our findings provide a better assessment of minimum wage violations than previous studies that have only considered violations of the federal minimum wage. And, because the total workforce in these 10 states accounts for more than half of the entire U.S. workforce, our estimates shed new light on the scope of wage theft nationwide.\n\nThe next section provides background on the minimum wage, the problem of wage theft in general, and previous research on the topic of wage theft. The subsequent sections present our findings and analysis of minimum wage violations in the 10 most populous states. The final section discusses the economic and social consequences of wage theft and what can be done to fight it.\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, established the basic protections that have governed work in the United States since the Great Depression. With regard to pay, the FLSA \u201cput a floor under wages and a ceiling over hours\u201d through the creation of the federal minimum wage and provisions for overtime pay\u2014i.e., a limit on the hours per week employees may work without receiving additional compensation (Roosevelt 1938). Over the years, the law has been periodically updated to strengthen protections or expand coverage to new classes of workers\u2014such as the 1966 amendments to the FLSA that extended coverage to service sector and hospitality workers, and the Department of Labor\u2019s extension of FLSA protections to home care workers in 2015.\n\nUnfortunately, over the past several decades, updates to the FLSA have been inadequate or too infrequent to keep pace with changes in the economy and employment. For example, as explained in Cooper (2015), the failure of federal lawmakers to adequately raise the federal minimum wage has left millions of workers being paid 25 percent less in inflation-adjusted terms than their counterparts almost 50 years ago. Similarly, Eisenbrey and Kimball (2016) describe how neglect of federal overtime rules has drastically reduced the share of the workforce that is eligible for overtime pay.\n\nAdditionally, in recent decades, employers have increasingly adopted business practices that have weakened the scope of protection afforded by the law. Groundbreaking research by the former Administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division, David Weil, documents the \u201cfissuring\u201d of U.S. workplaces and the growth of subcontracting (Weil 2014). Fissuring refers to the practice of companies contracting out various functions that were previously done in-house. In such arrangements, unscrupulous employers\u2014be it the subcontractor or the contracting parent company\u2014will sometimes use the multilayered or \u201cfissured\u201d nature of the employer-employee relationship to attempt to avoid responsibility when workers allege mistreatment. Weil also details how a growing share of the workforce today are classified as independent contractors\u2014and thereby not covered by the FLSA\u2014despite the fact that these workers perform tasks traditionally done via direct employment. In some cases, such arrangements are deliberate and illegal misclassification by employers seeking to dodge the tax and regulatory requirements of regular employment. Carr\u00e9 (2015) notes that numerous studies find that 10 to 20 percent of employers have misclassified a worker as an independent contractor.\n\nEven without employers trying to avoid the law, the FLSA has various built-in worker and employer exemptions that limit its scope to only a portion of American workers. For example, the law specifically excludes a variety of specific occupations from the minimum wage, such as newspaper delivery workers, seasonal farm workers, workers in commercial fisheries and canneries, private investigators, and telephone switchboard operators. Similarly, many salaried white-collar workers whose duties are deemed executive, administrative, or professional, and whose pay is above a set threshold, are excluded from the overtime provisions of the law. Businesses with annual revenue less than $500,000 that do not engage in \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d are exempt from the wage and hour provisions of the FLSA altogether. In the 10 states analyzed in this study, we estimate that the federal minimum wage law covers roughly 72 percent of civilian, noninstitutionalized workers. When state minimum wage laws are also taken into account, about 88 percent of the workforce is covered by either state or federal minimum wage laws.\n\nMany states provide stronger protections or expanded coverage beyond the FLSA in state law. For example, California\u2019s minimum wage\u2014in addition to being significantly higher than the federal minimum wage \u2014covers nearly 100 percent of workers in the state. Other states, such as Michigan, have enacted higher wage standards yet allow a greater number of exemptions than the FLSA. Other states simply defer to the federal statute either for the level of the standard, the breadth of coverage, or both. In recent years, cities and counties have increasingly adopted their own minimum wages and other labor standards in light of federal or state inaction. The FLSA is explicit that when federal, state, or local labor laws are inconsistent, workers are always entitled to the highest standard. Yet the patchwork of varying levels of protection and coverage across the country can make it difficult for workers to know what their rights are and complicate jurisdictions\u2019 efforts to enforce the law, leading to significantly different economic outcomes for people doing the same job in different localities.\n\nWhile federal labor protections have been left to erode, the agency charged with enforcing wage and hour laws has been stretched increasingly thin. In 2015, the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2014the agency responsible for investigating minimum wage violations\u2014employed roughly the same number of investigators as it did nearly 70 years ago: WHD employed 1,000 investigators in 1948 and fewer than 1,000 in 2015 (Galvin 2016a; U.S. DOL 2017a). Yet today, the agency is expected to protect a workforce nearly six times larger than it did in the 1940s\u201422.6 million in 1948 and more than 135 million in 2015 (Galvin 2016a; U.S. DOL 2017b). In 1948, there was one investigator for every 22,600 covered workers; today it is one per every 135,000 workers. As the number of investigators per worker has shrunk, so has the agency\u2019s ability to effectively police violations of labor law: from 1980 to 2015, the number of cases investigated by the agency decreased by 63 percent (NELP 2008; U.S. DOL various years).\n\nThe lack of sufficient federal investigators is especially problematic for the many workers in states that do not have a state wage and hour office or similar enforcement body. Fourteen states, most of which use the federal minimum wage, either lack the capacity to investigate wage theft claims or lack the ability to file lawsuits on behalf of victims (Galvin 2016b). These states effectively defer to the federal government for enforcement. Workers in these states must seek any possible remedy from the federal government or through private litigation. Some states, such as Florida, lack any state labor department altogether.\n\nEven in states with their own enforcement powers, filing a wage theft claim against an employer can be extremely difficult. For example, Gordon et al. (2012) describe the daunting process required by the Iowa Workforce Development Agency (IWD):\n\nFew workers who experience wage and hour violations are able to pursue a private lawsuit against their employer, and even fewer employers end up paying any significant restitution. Employers found to have illegally underpaid an employee are usually required only to pay back a portion of the stolen wages\u2014not even the full amount owed, much less a penalty for violating the law (Galvin 2016a). Additional penalties are typically only imposed in cases where the employer forged false documents. In addition to the minuscule likelihood of being caught, employers who are found guilty of violating wage and hour laws typically still pay less than they would have had they paid workers their earned wages to begin with. Consequently, employers are effectively incentivized to violate the law. (U.S. GAO 1981; Ashenfelter and Smith 1979).\n\nRecent research by Daniel Galvin (2016a) finds that when states enact strong penalties against wage theft\u2014particularly \u201ctreble damages\u201d statutes that award victims of wage theft three times the value of their stolen wages\u2014it does have a deterrent effect. Workers experience measurably lower rates of wage theft in states with such laws. However, for the greatest impact, such laws must be accompanied by sufficient investigatory resources and authority, protections against retaliation for workers alleging mistreatment, payment of victims\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees by violators, and other legal provisions that empower victims to speak out against abuse.\n\nWage theft is the failure to pay workers the full wages to which they are legally entitled. As explained in Meixell and Eisenbrey (2014), \u201cin essence, it involves employers taking money that belongs to their employees and keeping it for themselves. Amounts that seem small, such as not paying for time spent preparing a work station at the start of a shift, or cleaning up at the end of a shift, can add up.\u201d\n\nWage theft can take many forms. Minimum wage violations occur when employees are paid less than the federal, state, or local minimum wage, depending on which is highest and covers the employee in question. For employees to be considered victims of minimum wage violations, those employees must be paid at an hourly wage rate less than the legal minimum, although they need not be paid on an hourly basis. Nonexempt workers paid on a weekly or salaried basis must still be paid at a level equivalent to an hourly rate of the minimum wage for all the hours that they work; minimum wage violations may occur when hourly workers are illegally required to work unpaid hours or when salaried employees work excessive hours\u2014either of which may cause their effective hourly wage rate to fall below the legal minimum wage.\n\nSalaried workers who do not meet the requirements that would exclude them from the overtime provisions of the FLSA (or state overtime laws) are also victims of wage theft if their employers fail to pay them at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked beyond 40 in a single week. Even if nonexempt employees are paid at their regular hourly rate for work hours beyond 40, they are still being cheated\u2014failure to pay the time-and-a-half overtime rate is illegal and constitutes wage theft.\n\nWage theft can also occur when employers deny workers meal breaks, make illegal deductions from employees\u2019 paychecks, or make illegal adjustments to reported work hours (Sellekaerts and Welch 1983; Bernhardt et al. 2009; Gordon et al. 2012). Some of these actions could result in minimum wage violations\u2014e.g., if an employer illegally adjusted reported work hours so that an employee was not paid for all hours worked, thereby bringing their effective hourly rate below the minimum wage. However, they would not need to result in a minimum wage violation for them to be unlawful. All of these actions constitute wage theft.\n\nTipped workers are especially prone to suffer wage theft because of their separate treatment under the law. In most states and under federal law, employers of workers who customarily receive tips\u2014such as restaurant servers and nail salon attendants\u2014may credit workers\u2019 tips against their required minimum wage. For example, federal law allows employers to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour, provided that the employees\u2019 tips over the course of a week raise their effective hourly pay to at least the minimum wage. If the tips are inadequate, employers are required to make up the difference. Unfortunately, policing this requirement is largely left to the tipped workers themselves, who would need to carefully track their weekly hours and tips to know if employers were paying an adequate base wage. Moreover, the FLSA and most state tipped wage laws do not specify the period over which weekly tips are supposed to be calculated, nor do they specify how employers are to treat secondary tipping\u2014when tipped workers share a portion of their tips with support staff.\n\nThe opaqueness of tipped wage laws leaves most tipped workers with little knowledge of their rights and particularly open to abuse. Allegretto and Cooper (2014) describe how tipped workers subject to a lower tipped minimum wage have lower total hourly take-home pay, have greater gender pay disparities, and experience poverty at much higher rates than nontipped workers or tipped workers who receive the full minimum wage before tips. Cooper (2017) shows that restaurant servers experience poverty at roughly double the rate of nontipped workers, with the highest poverty rates occurring in states with low tipped minimum wages.\n\nPrevious research has shown that wage theft disproportionately hurts low-wage workers, often already the most vulnerable segment of the workforce. The literature overwhelmingly finds that workers who experience wage theft are more likely to be women, to be nonwhite or Hispanic, and to have less education (Ashenfelter & Smith 1979; Bernhardt et al. 2009; ERG 2014; Galvin 2016; Sellekaerts & Welch 1984).\n\nAmong all forms of wage theft, minimum wage violations are particularly pernicious. By definition, minimum wage violations withhold earnings from the lowest-paid workers in society, who typically are the least able to afford a loss of income. Indeed, research by the Eastern Research Group on wage theft in California and New York showed that minimum wage violations took a significant percentage of pay from low-wage workers already struggling to make ends meet (ERG 2014). The same study found that minimum wage violations increased poverty rates among workers who experienced wage theft by 22.9 percent in California and 40.6 percent in New York. The authors note that when workers in low-income households are illegally underpaid, not only do those workers and their families suffer, but the public is harmed as well\u2014the government collects less in tax revenue, and taxpayers must provide additional funding for social welfare programs to fill in the gaps that employers created.\n\nThis report looks closely at one form of wage theft\u2014minimum wage violations\u2014and quantifies the impact of these violations on workers in the 10 most populous U.S. states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.\n\nAssessing the full impact of all forms of wage theft is exceedingly difficult. No public data source exists with the requisite information to accurately assess workers\u2019 exempt status, total hours worked, total wages received, and what forms of compensation they receive\u2014e.g., hourly/weekly base pay, tips, overtime, etc. Bernhardt et al. (2009) is perhaps the most comprehensive report on the occurrence of wage theft in its many forms. Yet to produce such a report, the researchers conducted their own survey of front-line workers in three major metropolitan areas; this survey was specially designed to capture evidence of multiple forms of wage theft. The authors found that, among low-wage workers in their sample, over a quarter were victims of minimum wage violations and more than two-thirds experienced at least one type of wage theft violation.\n\nOur study most closely resembles ERG (2014), a report commissioned for the U.S. Department of Labor on minimum wage violations and their monetary effects in California and New York. Like ERG, we use data from the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group to identify workers whose reported weekly earnings and weekly hours of work equate to an hourly wage below the binding minimum wage in their state. Our methods and findings are in line with ERG and other recent and historical literature on wage theft and minimum wage noncompliance. However, our study builds upon recent research in several important ways. In assessing minimum wage violations in the 10 most populous states, we account for each state\u2019s specific minimum wage laws and exemptions, in addition to those in the FLSA, thereby better isolating the workforce eligible for the minimum wage. Because we study the 10 most populous states, our statistics on the aggregate population across these states provides a more detailed picture of the breadth and magnitude of minimum wage violations in the United States than analyses of fewer states or select cities. Total nonfarm employment in these 10 states accounts for more than half (53 percent) of all U.S. employment. We also examine these largest states because doing so provides adequate sample sizes to produce detailed statistics within each state. The statistics in this report are averages for 2013 through 2015, thus presenting the most recent estimates of wage theft in the United States.\n\nIn the 10 most populous states in the country, 2.4 million minimum-wage-eligible workers report being paid less than the applicable minimum wage in their state. This represents just over 4 percent of all eligible workers in these states. Of course, minimum wage policy is most relevant for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution, and these 2.4 million victims of minimum wage violations make up more than 17 percent of all low-wage workers who are eligible for the minimum wage.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, workers suffering minimum wage violations report being paid, on average, $1.88 per hour less than the applicable state or federal minimum wage. Their lost wages amount to about $64 per week on average weekly earnings of only $203\u2014meaning that victims are losing nearly one-quarter of their weekly earnings to wage theft. For those workers that are employed 52 weeks per year, this implies average annual losses of over $3,300 per year on average annual wages received of only $10,500. The total annual wages denied these workers across all 10 states is over $8 billion. The workforce in these 10 states accounts for 53 percent of the total U.S. workforce. Thus, if the rates and magnitude of minimum wage violations are similar in the remaining states, it suggests that the total wages stolen by employers when workers are illegally paid below the minimum wage amounts to over $15 billion annually.\n\nTable 1 also describes the rates at which workers experience minimum wage violations in each of the 10 states included in this analysis, with some notable differences across states. First, the state with the highest rate of minimum wage violations is Florida, where 7.3 percent of eligible workers\u2014just over 400,000 people\u2014report being paid less than the minimum wage. This figure is even more shocking when considered as a share of the low-wage workforce in Florida: the data suggest that one out of every four low-wage workers in Florida is a victim of wage theft. (\u201cLow-wage minimum-wage-eligible workers\u201d includes all minimum-wage-eligible workers in the bottom quintile of wage earners in each state.)\n\nFigure A shows the shares of each state\u2019s minimum-wage-eligible low-wage workforce that reports being paid less than the minimum wage. After Florida (24.9 percent), Ohio has the second highest share with 22.7 percent of low-wage workers experiencing minimum wage violations, followed closely by Illinois, where 22.1 percent of low-wage workers are paid below the minimum wage.\n\nFlorida\u2019s high rate of minimum wage violations is noteworthy for two additional reasons. First, Florida\u2019s state minimum wage was higher than the federal minimum wage in all three years of this study, although it was never the highest of the states analyzed in this report. In theory, employers have a greater incentive to violate higher minimum wages because they face greater potential savings from underpayment. But during the survey period, California\u2019s minimum wage was $8.00 per hour through June of 2014 and then $9.00 per hour from July 2014 through December 2015. Florida\u2019s minimum wage was $7.79 for all of 2013, $7.93 for all of 2014, and $8.05 for all of 2015 (IWC n.d.; Florida DEO 2016). In fact, Florida\u2019s minimum wage ranks in the middle of the pack among these 10 states for the entire survey period. In other words, Florida\u2019s unusually high violation rates do not appear to be a result of the level of Florida\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nThe second reason Florida\u2019s high violation rate is noteworthy may explain why the state\u2019s high violation rate is occurring\u2014namely, that in Florida employers have little reason to think they will ever be caught. As explained in Galvin (2016), Florida has very weak state labor laws\u2014the fifth-weakest in the country, per Galvin\u2014and the state has no enforcement body to investigate abuse. Florida eliminated its Department of Labor and Employment Security in 2002. Our findings, thus, seem to corroborate Galvin\u2019s conclusion that the strength of a state\u2019s labor laws and its enforcement capacity do have a significant impact on the likelihood that employers will commit wage theft.\n\nAlthough workers in Florida are the most likely to suffer minimum wage violations, workers in Texas and Pennsylvania suffer the most when their wages are stolen. Figure B shows that workers in Texas whose employers fail to pay them at least the minimum wage for all hours worked are deprived of $85 each week. These workers are losing nearly one-third (31.7 percent) of their earned pay to wage theft. If these workers are employed 52 weeks per year, they lose $4,400 on average each year and have average annual wages of only $9,500. In Pennsylvania, workers experiencing minimum wage violations are underpaid by an average of $80 per week. Employers in Pennsylvania who commit wage theft are stealing, on average, 34.6 percent of the wages earned by victim employees. If these workers are employed 52 weeks per year, this amounts to losses of $4,200 per year on paid wages of only $8,500.\n\nWorkers in North Carolina have the third-highest average losses per victim due to minimum wage violations. Workers who suffer minimum wage violations in North Carolina lose an average of $72 per week, and their employers are illegally capturing 29 percent of their earned wages. If these workers are employed 52 weeks per year, this amounts to losses of $3,800 on paid wages of only $9,300 annually. The severity of minimum wage violations in North Carolina may come as less of a surprise given that the state\u2019s elected labor commissioner during the period studied showed little interest in enforcing wage laws. An investigation by The Charlotte Observer noted that during the commissioner\u2019s 15-year tenure, her office \u201csued companies for failing to pay wages only 35 times, an average of less than 2.5 times a year\u201d (Locke 2015).\n\nIt is noteworthy that in all three of these states\u2014Texas, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina\u2014the binding minimum wage is the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The particularly large lost wages for wage theft victims in these states, despite the relatively low value of the minimum wage, raises questions about these states\u2019 legal framework, penalty structure, and enforcement practices for combating wage theft. To the extent that these states are deferring enforcement to federal authorities, they may be placing their state\u2019s most vulnerable workers at risk of particularly harmful labor practices.\n\nIt should also be noted that these estimates were produced by calculating the difference between the effective minimum wage and workers\u2019 reported hourly wage. If some of these workers were promised more than the minimum wage, then these figures understate the true value of their lost wages.\n\nAs shown in Table 2, workers who experience minimum wage violations are far more likely to be in poverty than the other minimum-wage-eligible workers. Among the 2.4 million workers experiencing minimum wage violations in the analyzed states, 517,000\u2014or 21.4 percent\u2014had total family incomes below the poverty line. In contrast, the poverty rate of all minimum-wage-eligible workers in these states was only 6.9 percent. In other words, workers suffering minimum wage violations are more than three times as likely to be in poverty as someone chosen at random in the eligible workforce.\n\nTable 2 also shows that many of these workers are in poverty as a direct result of their employers\u2019 stealing from them. If all workers experiencing minimum wage violations were paid the applicable minimum wage for all reported hours worked, it would lift 31 percent of those in poverty above the poverty line. Consequently, the poverty rate among these workers would fall from 21.4 percent to 14.8 percent, and the overall poverty rate among the minimum-wage-eligible workforce would decline from 6.9 percent to 6.6 percent.\n\nWith such low levels of income, it is unsurprising that many of the workers who suffer minimum wage violations must rely on public assistance programs to make ends meet. Table 3 shows that roughly one in three workers experiencing minimum wage violations receive some form of public assistance, either directly or through a family member. One in five have a family member who receives free or reduced school lunch. Nearly 18 percent receive food-purchasing assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; formerly known as the Food Stamp Program). Just under 4 percent receive housing subsidies, and 3.4 percent receive home energy assistance. While these last two numbers may seem small, the rates of participation in these programs among those suffering minimum wage violations are nearly three times and two-and-a-half times, respectively, the rates of the overall minimum-wage-eligible workforce.\n\nThe demographic characteristics of workers who experience minimum wage violations closely resemble the demographics of the overall low-wage workforce (Cooper 2015). That is, workers who experience minimum wage violations are by definition low-wage. Low-wage workers are more likely to be vulnerable to minimum wage violations relative to the workforce in general, but those within the low-wage workforce are not necessarily more likely to experience minimum wage violations at a higher rate than other low-wage earners in their respective demographic categories. In fact, when we examine violation rates among just the low-wage workforce, many of the differences between demographic groups diminish or disappear. This shows that the problem of wage theft is not limited to any particular group; low-wage workers of all races, ethnicities, genders, and immigration statuses are being cheated out of pay at significant rates. Below, we discuss which minimum-wage-eligible workers experience minimum wage violations and the impact this has on all workers.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to experience minimum wage violations, as shown in Figure C. Women also make up a majority of victims of minimum wage violations despite making up less than half of the minimum-wage-eligible workforce. While the average annual amount stolen from men and women suffering minimum wage violations is comparable\u2014about $64 and $63 per week, respectively\u2014women tend to be paid less to begin with, meaning that the earned wages that they are denied constitute a greater share of their earnings (24.8 percent of women\u2019s wages compared with 22.8 percent of men\u2019s). Those workers that are employed 52 weeks per year lose $3,300 on average each year and have average annual wages of only $11,300 for men and $9,900 for women. In other words, women are paid less to begin with and thus are left even worse off after their wages are stolen.\n\nMen lose an average of $64 per week from minimum wage violations, totaling $3.6 billion annually. The average woman suffering a minimum wage violation loses $63 each week, but the larger number of women suffering violations brings the annual total of wages stolen from women workers to $4.4 billion. (See Appendix Table A3.)\n\nFigure D shows that young workers (age 16 to 24) are three times as likely to be paid below the minimum wage as older workers. Nearly 10 percent of young workers are paid less than the minimum wage. Young workers account for nearly one-third of workers experiencing minimum wage violations. However, older workers still make up the majority of those experiencing minimum wage violations. In fact, more than half of all workers suffering minimum wage violations are prime-age workers (age 25 to 54). Older workers (age 55 to 85) experience violations at a lower rate than young workers, but still account for about 16 percent of all workers suffering minimum wage violations.\n\nPrime-age and older workers also lose a larger share of their income to minimum wage violations. As shown in Figure D, workers age 25 to 54 experiencing minimum wage violations lose 24.1 percent of their earned wages to this form of wage theft, averaging a loss of $70 per week. If these workers are employed 52 weeks per year, they lose $3,600 on average each year. Victims age 55 and older lose a similar amount, but due to their lower average wage levels, their losses represent more than a quarter of their earned wages (25.5 percent). In total, $4.5 billion is stolen from prime-age workers and $1.4 billion from older workers. Young workers suffering violations lose $2.1 billion annually. They are denied, on average, $50 per week\u201422.5 percent of their earned wages\u2014or $2,600 for those that work the full year.\n\nWorkers of color are more likely to experience minimum wage violations than white workers, as shown in Figure E. Roughly 5 percent of black workers and Hispanic workers are paid less than the minimum wage, compared with only 3.5 percent of white workers. This is partly a function of the fact that people of color are disproportionately represented among low-wage workers (Cooper 2015; Wilson & Rodgers 2016). Nevertheless, white workers still make up the largest share (47.1 percent) of workers experiencing minimum wage violations.\n\nWhite workers suffering minimum wage violations have the largest share of annual wages stolen\u201426.5 percent\u2014compared with 21.4 percent for black workers, 21.2 percent for Hispanic workers, and 24.3 percent for workers of other races and ethnicities. White workers lose an average of $67 each week, totaling $4 billion per year. If these workers are employed 52 weeks per year, they lose $3,500 on average each year from minimum wage violations. On average, minimum wage violations amount to $55 weekly for black workers, $60 weekly for Hispanic workers, and $69 weekly for workers of other races. For those with a full-year work schedule of 52 weeks, these weekly losses translate to an annual total of $2,900 for black workers, $3,100 for Hispanic workers, and $3,600 for workers of other races. The amount of annual wages lost to minimum wage violations for nonwhite workers totals $4 billion per year.\n\nThe incidence of minimum wage violations for nonwhite workers is intertwined with their nativity and citizenship status. Among workers who are victims of minimum wage violations, U.S.-born citizens make up nearly three-quarters (72.3 percent) of workers suffering violations\u2014and over four-fifths of the total minimum-wage-eligible workforce are U.S. citizens, as shown in Figure F. Workers who were not born in the United States have higher minimum wage violation rates than those born in the U.S.; however, naturalized citizens have rates more similar to those of U.S.-born citizens. The overall violation rate among native-born citizens is 3.8 percent, and the rate for naturalized citizens is 4.1 percent. Noncitizens are significantly more likely to experience minimum wage violations than either U.S.-born or naturalized citizens: 6.5 percent report being paid below the minimum wage.\n\nThe higher violation rate among noncitizens is not surprising, as workers who lack the protections of citizenship are more easily exploited. Immigrant workers may be forced to suffer exploitive conditions out of fear that employers may question their immigration status. Many authorized immigrant workers may have family or friends who lack authorization; they may fear retribution against their community if they speak out against abuse. The exploitation of immigrant workers is a problem, however, that has implications for immigrants and nonimmigrants alike. Whenever any group of workers can be exploited and paid artificially low wages, it lowers the wages of similarly skilled workers and other workers in the same industry\u2014regardless of those workers\u2019 nativity (Costa, Cooper, and Shierholz 2014).\n\nWorkers with less education are more likely to experience minimum wage violations than workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. This is largely because workers with lower educational attainment make up a disproportionate share of low-wage workers. Figure G shows that nearly 9 percent of workers with less than a high school diploma are paid below the minimum wage, compared with 4.5 percent of high school graduates, 4.3 percent of workers with some college experience, and only 1.9 percent of workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. The vast majority of workers suffering minimum wage violations (86.0 percent) do not have a college degree.\n\nAs shown in Figure H, unmarried workers\u2014with and without children\u2014are more likely to experience minimum wage violations than married workers. This is particularly troubling for single parents who may be the sole provider for one or more children at home. Parents make up about a quarter (26.4 percent) of workers experiencing minimum wage violations; about a third of these are single parents.\n\nAlthough single parents have slightly lower rates of minimum wage violations than unmarried workers without children (4.7 percent, compared with 5.6 percent), single parents who are victims of minimum wage violations lose a larger share of their earnings than workers in any other family type. Employers who underpay single parents are stealing a quarter (25.3 percent) of these workers\u2019 earnings. Single parents are underpaid by an average of $69 per week, which amounts to an average of $3,600 each year for those that work 52 weeks per year. On average, married parents experiencing minimum wage violations lose 23.5 percent of their earnings, married workers without children lose 24.6 percent, and unmarried workers without children lose 23.5 percent.\n\nSingle and married parents lose a weekly average of $69 and $70, respectively, to minimum wage violations. If these workers are employed 52 weeks per year, they lose $3,600 on average each year. Across all victims in the 10 states studied, this adds up to $2.3 billion each year that parents earn but are not paid. Among workers without children, married workers lose an average of $71 each week to minimum wage violations\u2014totaling $3,700 for those working 52 weeks per year\u2014and unmarried workers are robbed of an average of $58 weekly\u2014totaling $3,000 for those working the full year. Married workers without children lose a total of $1.7 billion each year to minimum wage violations, and unmarried workers without children lose a total of $4 billion each year.\n\nAs shown in Figure I, the majority of workers who experience minimum wage violations come from families of modest means. Nearly 29 percent of all those with a violation have total family incomes less than $25,000; nearly half have total family incomes less than $40,000; and nearly two-thirds have family incomes less than $60,000.\n\nPart-time workers (those employed fewer than 35 hours per week) are three-and-a-half times more likely to experience minimum wage violations than those who work full time (35 hours or more per week), as shown in Figure J. Still, full-time workers make up more than half (52.5 percent) of all workers suffering minimum wage violations.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality industry has historically had the highest rates of low-wage workers and minimum wage violations (Bernhardt et al. 2009; ERG 2014). This is heavily driven by food and drink service establishments where workers earn most of their pay through tips and face special challenges in ensuring their employers are paying them properly. In order to get a better picture of the degree to which food and drink service workers are affected by minimum wage violations compared with other leisure and hospitality workers, we extracted the data for food and drink service workers into a separate category. Consistent with past research, our results show that workers in food and drink service are more likely than workers in any other industry to experience minimum wage violations. As shown in Figure K, over 14 percent of all workers in food and drink service (one out of every seven) report being paid less than the minimum wage. (See Appendix Table A3 for data on other industries and occupations.) Food and drink service workers make up over a quarter (25.9 percent) of all workers suffering minimum wage violations\u2014the largest share of any single industry.\n\nThe industries with the next highest rates of violations are agriculture, forestry, and fishing (9.1 percent); leisure and hospitality excluding food and drink service (6.8 percent); and retail (4.7 percent). Many agriculture workers\u2014particularly seasonal agriculture workers\u2014are exempt from the minimum wage under federal law and under many state laws. Still, those who are subject to the minimum wage have higher rates of minimum wage violations than workers in most other industries. This is likely because the agriculture workforce is predominantly nonwhite and immigrant, with lower levels of education\u2014all factors that correlate with higher rates of wage theft.\n\nAmong major occupations, as shown in Figure L, workers who experience minimum wage violations are more likely to work in a service job than in any other occupation. Service workers make up 46.5 percent of all workers suffering minimum wage violations. The next closest occupational categories are sales workers (15.0 percent) and office and administrative support (8.1 percent).\n\nFigure M shows that workers not covered by unions\u2014those who are neither in a union themselves nor covered by a union contract\u2014are almost twice as likely (4.4 percent) to experience minimum wage violations as those in a union or covered by a union contract (2.3 percent). Workers are less likely to be victims of wage theft when they have bargaining power. Not only are non-union workers more likely to experience wage theft\u2014those who are victims lose a larger share of their income compared to workers covered by a union. Among workers suffering minimum wage violations, those not covered by a union lose nearly one-quarter (24.0 percent) of their earnings on average. Those who are covered by a union lose an average of 17.4 percent of their earnings (see Appendix Table A3).\n\nThe findings in this paper should help illuminate the severity of the problem of wage theft in the United States. Accurately measuring wage theft is a difficult task. State and federal violation records undoubtedly understate the true severity of the problem because most wage theft goes unreported and enforcement is under-resourced. Public surveys that collect wage and hour information do not capture the requisite information to assess wage theft in all the ways it can occur. Even studies that use the best publicly available data sources, such as this one, must cope with a high degree of measurement error\u2014which we discuss more fully in the appendix.\n\nNevertheless, the findings in this report\u2014and similar previous studies\u2014indicate that even when examining only one form of possible wage theft, the magnitude of the crime being committed against American workers is huge. Workers in the 10 most populous states, home to about half of the country\u2019s total workforce, are being cheated out of $8 billion annually. If these findings hold true for the other half of the U.S. workforce, it would mean that bad employers across the country are stealing around $15 billion annually from their employees just from minimum wage violations alone.\n\nIt is worth noting that this number, $15 billion, exceeds the value of property crimes committed in the United States each year: according to the FBI, the total value of all robberies, burglaries, larceny, and motor vehicle theft in the United States in 2015 was $12.7 billion (FBI 2016; Meixell & Eisenbrey 2014). Property crime is a better understood, more tangible form of crime than wage theft, and federal, state, and local governments spend tremendous resources to combat it. In contrast, lawmakers in much of the country allocate little, if any, resources to fighting wage theft, yet the cost of wage theft is at least comparable to\u2014and likely much higher than\u2014the cost of property crime. (It is important to note that our estimate doesn\u2019t include all forms of wage theft: if minimum wage violations total $15 billion on their own, it is likely the full cost of all forms of wage theft\u2014including failure to pay overtime, misclassification, off-the-clock violations, illegal deductions, and others\u2014dwarfs the cost of property crime.) It is beyond the scope of this report to assess the efficiency of spending public dollars to fight one form of crime versus another; however, our findings should raise questions among lawmakers as to whether adequate resources are being dedicated to ensuring the economic security of Americans not just in public and in their homes, but at their jobs.\n\nFiscally responsible lawmakers and concerned citizens should also recognize that when employers steal from their employees, there are public costs. At the simplest level, when earned wages are not paid to workers, there is a straightforward loss in payroll and income tax revenue. States with sales taxes are also likely to forego sales tax revenues from the stolen income that workers will never spend and that employers may choose to save.\n\nThis report also shows that many workers who suffer minimum wage violations have total family incomes below the federal poverty line, and one-third of workers experiencing violations rely on taxpayer-funded public assistance programs. As discussed in Cooper (2016), considerable public savings could come from raising wages more broadly among low-wage workers\u2014for example, by raising the federal minimum wage or pursuing policies that strengthen these workers\u2019 bargaining power\u2014and this savings could go a long way toward bolstering safety net programs or funding new public investments. But the \u201csavings\u201d to be had from eliminating wage theft is different\u2014it is actually a recouping of money employers have stolen from both employees and taxpayers, since at least some portion of public dollars going to support these low-wage workers and their families are dollars they already earned on the job.\n\nThe loss of income for victims of wage theft also weakens the consumer demand that drives the U.S. economy. The majority of workers suffering minimum wage violations come from families of modest means, most of which spend every dollar of income they receive simply because they must in order to make ends meet. In contrast, corporations and business owners are likely to save a larger portion of their income. This implies that when money is taken from low-wage workers and kept by employers, it leads to a net loss in consumer demand. The $8 billion in illegally withheld earnings identified in this study is not a huge sum in the context of the macro economy\u2014but it certainly is a large sum for the low-wage workers from whom it is stolen, and especially for those who live in low-income households where their wages make up a significant portion of family income. Improving the welfare of low-income households has the potential not just for short-term increases in consumer demand, but also for longer-term improvements in those households\u2019 ability to better their own financial footing. Research has shown that raising incomes for low-income households improves health outcomes, educational outcomes, and social mobility\u2014the likelihood that children will be able to achieve greater financial success than their parents (Leigh 2016; Mishel et al. 2012b; Duncan, Ziol-Guest, and Kalil 2008).\n\nIf there is a silver lining in our findings, it is that our results seem to corroborate Galvin (2016a), who finds that tougher wage and hour laws and stronger enforcement against wage theft deter higher rates of violations. In other words, this is a solvable problem. Although we do not attempt to replicate Galvin\u2019s more rigorous causal assessment of the relationship between the strength of a state\u2019s labor laws and violation rates, our descriptive results do fit with Galvin\u2019s conclusions. They suggest that strengthening a state\u2019s legal protections against wage theft, increasing penalties, and bolstering enforcement capacities may help to reduce the incidence of employers cheating their workers out of pay.\n\nArguments that strengthening labor laws or cracking down on violators might hurt business growth or disadvantage one jurisdiction\u2019s \u201cbusiness climate\u201d versus another\u2019s are specious and damaging to law-abiding business owners. Employers that commit wage theft have artificially lower labor costs and thus may be able to undercut competitors who follow the law. No business should be able to gain a competitive advantage by cheating its employees. If a business cannot succeed without breaking the law, it should not exist.\n\nFinally, wage theft has ramifications for the trajectory of wages and incomes for the broad middle class. When employers can exploit millions of people, it harms an even larger group, because it puts downward pressure on wages for similarly skilled workers and others in the same industries. As discussed in Bivens et al. (2014), many factors have suppressed wage growth for U.S. workers over the past four decades. The ability of employers to steal earned wages from their employees\u2014largely with impunity\u2014is but one more factor that has kept a generation of American workers from achieving greater improvements in their standard of living. Lawmakers who care about the long-term economic health of American households and the ability of ordinary working people to get ahead should be paying more attention to whether those workers are actually being paid all the wages they have earned.\n\nThis paper was made possible by a grant from the Public Welfare Foundation.

The CPS-ORG data is widely recognized as the best publicly available source of hourly wage information. Past research on wage theft has found that the CPS works well for identifying minimum wage violations, although the CPS does have some limitations, which are discussed later in this section. In order to have sufficient samples of low-wage workers in all states, we use three years of data for calendar years 2013\u20132015.\n\nThe CPS is the longest-running government survey of labor market conditions in the United States. CPS data are used to calculate the monthly unemployment rate, and supplements to the CPS are used to measure a host of other government statistics on wages, incomes, union membership, health insurance coverage, and poverty. Respondents to the CPS are surveyed for four consecutive months, excluded for the next eight months, and then surveyed again for four more months. In the fourth month and in the final month\u2014i.e., before going \u201cout of rotation\u201d\u2014participants are asked about their hourly and weekly pay, as well as the number of hours they worked in the preceding week. With this information, we can identify minimum wage violations by comparing respondents\u2019 reported hourly wage against the state minimum wage that was in effect in the month they were surveyed.\n\nThere are, however, some challenges that must be addressed in the CPS hourly wage data. First, the ORG data only report hourly wages for those workers that indicate they are paid on an hourly basis. For non-hourly workers, the ORG data report only weekly earnings inclusive of any overtime, tips, bonuses, and commissions (OTBC). Ideally, to compare workers\u2019 regular hourly wage against the minimum wage, we would need an estimate of weekly earnings inclusive of tips and commissions, but not bonuses or overtime. Although some respondents do report working more than 40 hours in a week, it is not possible to easily disaggregate wages paid at their regular hourly rate from wages potentially paid at an overtime premium rate (\u201ctime-and-a-half\u201d).\n\nSimilar challenges arise for tipped workers who do report being paid hourly. Tipped workers are supposed to report their base wage before tips in response to one survey question and their total weekly earnings, inclusive of OTBC, in a second. This should allow researchers to analyze hourly wages both inclusive and exclusive of tips, but the inclusion of overtime and bonuses in the weekly earnings data can be problematic for tipped workers who may be receiving both tips and overtime.\n\nTo address these challenges, we calculate hourly wages in the sample using the most conservative approach. For hourly workers that do not report receiving any OTBC, we use their reported hourly wage. For hourly workers that do report receiving OTBC, we use the greater of their reported hourly wage or their weekly earnings, inclusive of OTBC, divided by weekly hours. For all non-hourly workers, we calculate hourly wages using their reported weekly earnings, inclusive of OTBC, divided by their reported weekly hours. This approach means that our estimates may be understating the true incidence of minimum wage violations and the volume of wages stolen, since we are treating bonuses, overtime, and commissions as part of the hourly base wage.\n\nConsistent with ERG (2014) and Galvin (2016a), we exclude from our final sample all observations of workers not specifying hourly/nonhourly status, observations of nonhourly workers with weekly earnings less than $10, and all observations of workers with hourly wages less than $1. We then distribute the weights from these observations to all remaining valid observations.\n\nAs explained in the body of the report, not all workers are eligible for the minimum wage. The FLSA has a variety of exemptions for different occupations and classes of workers. State minimum wage laws also vary greatly in the volume and types of exemptions allowed for businesses to pay workers less than the minimum wage. For example, virtually all workers in California are subject to the state minimum wage. In contrast, Florida\u2019s state minimum wage law explicitly exempts all workers exempted from the federal minimum wage.\n\nTo limit our sample to minimum-wage-eligible workers, we carefully account for all possible exemptions to the minimum wage portions of the FLSA and each state\u2019s specific minimum wage exemptions. In cases where the data do not allow for the straightforward exemption of a particular industry or occupation, we either take the broadest possible interpretation of the exemption or randomly assign exempt status to the proportion of workers in that industry or occupation that the Department of Labor estimates to be exempt from the FLSA. For example, DOL estimates that 3 percent of seasonal amusement and recreational establishment workers are exempt. (See Kimball and Mishel 2015 and U.S. DOL 2015 for further detail.) Thus, we mark as exempt from the FLSA 3 percent of workers in those industries that can include seasonal amusement and recreational establishment workers: independent artists, performing arts, spectator sports, and related industries; museums, art galleries, historical sites, and similar institutions; bowling centers; other amusement, gambling, and recreation industries; and recreational vehicle parks, camps, and rooming and boarding houses.\n\nThe list of all federal and state exemptions is too long to include here; however, we are happy to provide greater detail upon request.\n\nAppendix Table A1 shows the share of the workforce in each of the 10 most populous states that we estimate to be covered under federal or state minimum wage laws. Of the roughly 67.3 million workers in these 10 states, we estimate that 71.7 percent are covered under the FLSA, 84.8 percent are covered under state minimum wage laws, and 87.6 percent are covered under either the FLSA or state minimum wage laws. Although California does have some exemptions to the minimum wage\u2014such as door-to-door salespeople and individuals who are the parent, spouse, or child of the employer\u2014they are very limited and most cannot be identified in the CPS data. Thus, in our sample, we consider nearly all California workers to be covered by the state minimum wage. (We exempt door-to-door salespeople, which reduces the minimum-wage-eligible workforce by 0.04 percent to 99.96 percent.) Florida\u2019s 72.3 percent of workers covered by either the state or federal minimum wage is the lowest share covered of all the states analyzed in this report. Florida\u2019s state minimum wage law does not cover any additional workers beyond those already covered by the FLSA.\n\nAs noted in the body of this report, accurately measuring minimum wage violations is challenging, and even the best public data sources\u2014such as the CPS-ORG data we use\u2014contain measurement error that can confound results. In this section, we describe the results of a series of sensitivity tests we performed, similar to those in ERG (2014), to assess how measurement error may be influencing our findings.\n\nAppendix Table A2 shows the results of three different sensitivity tests. The first row presents our original results. The second row shows results for only those CPS respondents that report being hourly workers; these workers should have less measurement error in their hourly wage data than workers paid on a weekly or salaried basis. In this specification, the workforce analyzed shrinks by roughly one-third and the share of workers experiencing minimum wage violations drops by 0.5 percentage points to 3.6 percent. The amount of wages stolen falls by 16.5 percent on an hourly basis and 25 percent on a weekly or annual basis. The share of affected workers\u2019 earned wages that are not paid shrinks by 3.8 percentage points to 20.1 percent.\n\nThe third row of Appendix Table A2 shows results excluding all CPS responses that were given by a member of the household on another member\u2019s behalf\u2014i.e., proxy responses. Because household members may not be fully informed of each other\u2019s exact wage rates and work schedules, proxy responses can be more susceptible to measurement error. When we exclude proxy responses, the analyzed workforce is cut roughly in half. We find that 3.3 percent report being paid wages below the minimum wage\u2014a reduction of 0.8 percentage points from the baseline analysis. The average hourly wages lost actually increases by 11.0 percent, and the weekly wages lost increases by 14.7 percent. In this specification, workers report losing, on average, 26.1 percent of their earned pay.\n\nFor the last row of Appendix Table A2, we do not count instances of minimum wage violations if the reported or calculated hourly wage is within 25 cents of the applicable minimum wage. Researchers have found that CPS respondents are prone to round their hourly wage rates to the nearest dollar\u2014e.g., reporting an hourly wage of $7.00 when they are actually paid $7.25. Thus, in this specification, we assume that reported wages as low as $0.25 below the applicable minimum wage are instances of errors in reporting, not wage theft. With this leeway, the share of the workforce experiencing minimum wage violations falls by 0.7 percentage points to 3.4 percent. Since we are restricting the pool of affected workers to those that experience wage theft of more than 25 cents, we do not report changes in the amount of lost wages as we would be directly biasing any such calculations.\n\nWhile there is undoubtedly measurement error in the CPS-ORG data, it is still the best available public data source on hourly wages. Where possible, we have taken the more conservative approach in our estimates, particularly in how we handle exemptions and how we construct hourly wage values for non-hourly workers. The results of these sensitivity tests show that even when we limit our sample to those observations with the most accurate wage information, or allow for greater error in the wage measure before designating a violation, we see that there are still millions of workers who appear to be victims of wage theft and that their losses are substantial.\n\nAppendix Table A3 shows the full demographic and wage statistics for the minimum-wage-eligible workforce and workers suffering minimum wage violations in the 10 states studied. Appendix Tables A4 through A13 show the same statistics for each individual state.\n\nSee Appendix Table A1 for more information about coverage of federal and state minimum wage laws.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, California\u2019s state minimum wage was raised to $10.50 per hour. It is scheduled to rise to $15 per hour on January 1, 2022.\n\nTo see a complete list of cities and counties that have adopted higher minimum wages, see EPI\u2019s Minimum Wage Tracker (EPI 2017).\n\nTen states have no investigatory capacity; seven of these use the federal minimum wage. Four additional states have investigatory capacity but do not have the ability to file civil suits on behalf of harmed workers; of these four, three use the federal minimum wage. See Galvin (2016b) for details.\n\nNote that overtime violations are distinct from minimum wage violations, though both may occur in the same incident. That is, an employer who fails to pay a worker for hours worked over 40, such that the employee\u2019s average wage falls below the minimum wage, is guilty of both an overtime violation (failure to pay the time-and-a-half premium for hours over 40 in a week) and a minimum wage violation (failure to pay the minimum wage for each hour worked). The data used in this study do not allow us to identify overtime violations separately; however, we do observe instances of minimum wage violations that are also overtime violations\u2014provided that the affected worker is eligible for overtime.\n\nFor more research on wages and government assistance, see Cooper (2016).\n\nStudies from within the last 10 years find violation rates between 2.3 and 4.3 percent for all workers and between 11.1 and 19.5 percent for low-wage workers (Bernhardt et al. 2009; ERG 2014; Galvin 2016a). An in-depth discussion of our findings can be found in the next section.\n\nWe do not account for cities or counties with minimum wages higher than their state minimum wage. Thus, our estimates may understate the volume of minimum wage violations in states containing localities with higher minimum wages.\n\nAs detailed in the appendix, minimum wage violations are calculated based upon the minimum wage in effect in each state in each year.\n\nThroughout this report, \u201clow-wage workers\u201d are identified as all workers in the bottom quintile of wage earners within each state. In our data, that is an hourly wage of $10.21 in California, $10.04 in Florida, $10.07 in Georgia, $10.30 in Illinois, $10.13 in Michigan, $10.73 in New York, $9.96 in North Carolina, $10.26 in Ohio, $10.43 in Pennsylvania, and $10.02 in Texas.\n\nWorkers receiving any public assistance reflect those workers whose families receive benefits through at least one of these programs: SNAP, LIHEAP, Section-8 housing assistance, or the reduced school lunch program.\n\nOver two-thirds (69 percent) of minimum wage violations in the agriculture industry take place in California, where all agriculture workers are entitled to the state minimum wage.\n\nSee Mishel et al.
